"Dec 18, 2022 00:00", Investing.com,Apple to to halt US sales of Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 this week - 9to5Mac,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-to-halt-us-sales-of-watch-series-9-and-watch-ultra-2-this-week--9to5mac-432SI-3942390,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is halting sales of its flagship Apple Watch models in the United States following an International Trade Commission (ITC) ruling in a patent dispute with medical technology company Masimo, according to 9to5Mac, which quoted a statement from the tech giant.

According to the publication, the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will no longer be available to buy from Apple's website in the US after 3 pm ET on Thursday, December 21, while in-store inventory will no longer be available from Apple retail locations after December 24.

The lower-end Apple Watch SE, which lacks a blood oxygen sensor, is unaffected and will remain available for sale.

The International Trade Commission upheld a judge’s decision in October, sending the case to the Biden administration for review. During the process, US President Biden can veto the ruling, although this has not yet occurred, and it expires on December 25.

According to 9to5Mac, Apple is making today's announcement as a preemptive measure to comply with the ITC’s decision.

The ITC's order only prohibits Apple from selling the affected models, which means that for now, the devices will remain available for purchase from other outlets. However, the order does block all Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 imports to the US after December 25.

Existing Apple Watch models with blood oxygen monitoring will continue to function without change.

Apple is strongly contesting the ITC's ruling and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that the Apple Watch remains available to customers.

The tech giant told 9to5Mac that it ""strongly disagrees with the order"" and is seeking a range of legal and technical options to ensure the Apple Watch is available to customers."

Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares fell 0.8% in pre-market Monday after Bloomberg News reported that various Chinese government agencies and state-backed companies are reportedly instructing their employees not to bring Apple iPhones and other foreign devices to work.

This move aligns with China's long-term goal of reducing reliance on foreign technologies and promoting the use of domestic products.

Several state firms and government departments in multiple provinces have issued directives in the past month or two, encouraging employees to use local brands."
"Dec 18, 2022 00:00", IANS,Google to end ‘geofence warrant’ requests for users’ location data,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-end-geofence-warrant-requests-for-users-location-data-3941318,"New Delhi, Dec 18 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has moved to end a long-running surveillance practice called “geofence warrants”, a practice that allowed law enforcement agencies to use Google’s location data to identify potential criminals. “Geofence warrants” require a provider — like Google — to search its entire reserve of user location data to identify all users or devices located within a geographic area during a time period specified by law enforcement.

According to TechCrunch, the use of “geofence warrants” have increased in recent years which, according to people, are unconstitutional.

Google announced last week that the Timeline feature in Maps helps you remember places you’ve been and is powered by a setting called Location History.

“If you’re among the subset of users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default), soon your Timeline will be saved right on your device — giving you even more control over your data,” the company informed.

Just like before, you can delete all or part of your information at any time or disable the setting entirely.

Google did not mention “geofence warrants” directly but this move will now force police to seek a search warrant to access a specific device, rather than asking Google for the data.

Geofence warrants have been possible because Google collects and stores specific user location data altogether in a massive database called “Sensorvault.”

Google reported several years ago that geofence warrants make up 25 per cent of all warrants it receives each year.

Police in Minneapolis used a geofence warrant to identify individuals who attended protests following the police killing of George Floyd in early 2021. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said in a blog post that “for now, at least, we’ll take this as a win” .

""These changes would appear to make it much more difficult—if not impossible — for Google to provide mass location data in response to a geofence warrant, a change we’ve been asking Google to implement for years,” said the foundation.

“It’s very welcome news for technology users as we usher in the end of 2022,” the EFF added.

In its transparency report in 2022, Apple (NASDAQ: ) said it received 13 geofence warrants demanding its customers’ location data, but provided no data.

It can be used for subscriptions from one developer or two different developers.

“We’re currently piloting this feature and will be onboarding more developers in the coming months,” Apple said in an update.

“If you’re interested in implementing contingent pricing in your app, you can start planning today and sign up to get notified when more details are available in January,” the tech giant added.

Developers will be able to base this on subscriptions “from one developer or two different developers” as long as both subscriptions remain active.

According to 9to5Mac, the discounts can be used in App Store advertising and marketing outside of it, in addition to within the app itself.

Apple engineering manager Pete Hare said in a LinkedIn post that the company will “handle all the eligibility checks and commerce work”.

“We handle all the eligibility checks and commerce work to allow for seamless in-app purchases in your own apps, and also Apple-provided flows to subscribe and download in one step directly from email links or the App Store - to allow you to discount your services based on other apps in the App Store,” he explained.

"Dec 18, 2022 00:00", IANS,HK media mogul Jimmy Lai's trial begins,https://in.investing.com/news/hk-media-mogul-jimmy-lais-trial-begins-3941281,"Hong Kong, Dec 18 (IANS) The trial of Hong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, who has been in prison since 2020 over charges of colluding with ""foreign forces"", began on Monday and if found guilty, the 76-year-old could face life imprisonment.Lai, a UK citizen, was arrested under the National Security Law (NSL), introduced by China in 2020 in response to massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, insisting that the law was necessary to quell unrest.

China considers Lai a traitor who sought to undermine its national security, the BBC reported.

According to the media mogul's legal team, he has been denied his choice of legal representation, after Beijing barred him from appointing a UK lawyer.

He is being tried by three judges handpicked by Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, the team added.

Lai, an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party, is one of the most high-profile people to be arrested under the NSL.

Before he was detained, he was often at the frontline of pro-democracy protests, such as the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 demonstrations against an extradition bill.

He founded and ran some of Hong Kong's best-known media outlets, including the now-defunct newspaper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily.

Lai is also facing a sedition charge under a colonial-era law based on his tweets, interviews he hosted, as well as articles published in Apple Daily, the BBC reported.

Since he is a British citizen, his son Sebastian Lai has been lobbying the UK government to intervene on his father's behalf.

Sebastian Lai also met UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron earlier this month.

On Sunday while calling for Jimmy Lai's release, Cameron said: ""I am gravely concerned that anyone is facing prosecution under the National Security Law, and particularly concerned at the politically motivated prosecution of British national Jimmy Lai.

""As a prominent and outspoken journalist and publisher, Jimmy Lai has been targeted in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association.""

Since his arrest in August 2020, Lai has been held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison for more than 1,000 days.

The trial, which has been delayed for a year, is expected to last for about 80 days.

With 23.4 million units and 21 per cent share, Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the global market, followed by Samsung (KS: ) and homegrown boAt.

Shipments of wireless headphones surpassed those of wireless earphones for the first time, predominantly due to vendors seeking stronger revenue drivers through wireless headphones and wireless earphones being replaced by TWS.

Alternative wearable forms, such as air and bone conduction devices, made up less than 2 per cent of shipments in the third quarter.

“The Q3 decline was partly caused by vendors’ strategic decision to skip yearly flagship releases, effectively extending refresh cycles following vendors prioritising premium models,” said Jack Leathem, Research Analyst.

In China, one of the fastest-growing players was Huawei, which leveraged its strong smartphone growth to cross-sell ecosystem devices, and consequently grew its shipments by 30 per cent compared with Q3 2022.

“We expect growth to return in Q4, driven by replenishing inventories and holiday shopping season deals,” said Leathem.

Improving economic conditions and expected flagship portfolio launches from Apple and Samsung should further boost the market in 2024.

Canalys estimates that total shipments for 2024 will be 3.3 per cent higher than in 2022.

2022-12-16, IANS,"Phones to chips, electronics sector buoyed by strong tailwinds",https://in.investing.com/news/phones-to-chips-electronics-sector-buoyed-by-strong-tailwinds-3940489,"New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The last 9-10 years have seen tremendous growth across four major consumer electronics segments -- mobile phones, consumer electronics, IT hardware and electronic components -- that account for over 70 per cent of India’s domestic manufacturing profile.

The pace is such that tech giants are now lining up investments worth billions of dollars in the country.

The country is rapidly becoming an electronics manufacturing hub, with the sector expected to rise to $300 billion by 2025-26. From Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Foxconn and US-based Micron Technologies to domestic major Tata Group, the companies are aiming to leverage domestic capabilities to achieve supply chain diversification and scale up production by manufacturing in the country.

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn has received approval to invest at least $1 billion more in a plant in India that will manufacture Apple products. The fresh investment is on top of the $1.6 billion it earlier set aside for the 300-acre site close to the Bengaluru airport.

Meanwhile, the Tata Group is planning to build one of India's largest iPhone assembly plants in Tamil Nadu (NS: )'s Hosur. According to media reports, the facility is expected to feature around 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years. The site is expected to be operational within 12 to 18 months.

With Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron selling its India operations to the Tata Group for $125 million, Tata Electronics is going to become the first Indian company to manufacture new Apple iPhones in the country, which is a major fillip to the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.

According to reports, Apple plans to expand its investment in the country to approximately $40 billion over the next four to five years. Apple has already crossed the $7 billion production milestone during the previous fiscal year.

Apple is aiming to manufacture more than 50 million iPhones in India per year, as it aims to shift some of the production out from China. The tech giant aims to achieve the target within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned after that, according to the Wall Street Journal.

According to government and industry data, India saw mobile phones exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the ongoing fiscal year (FY24).

As per estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), accessed by IANS, the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year. The country is now the second-biggest manufacturing hub for mobile phones due to heavy investment from original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers and companies dealing in components and parts.

India is expected to export about 22 per cent of its total assembled mobile phones in 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

However, “China’s manufacturing and supply chain will still maintain its essential role in the longer run,” says senior research analyst Ivan Lam.

According to Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, India's domestic consumer electronics manufacturing sector has soared, propelled by a mix of strong tailwinds.

“A conducive policy environment is attracting strong investments, while a burgeoning R&D pool in areas like chip design and AI is fostering innovation. Domestic champions are leading the charge, prioritizing IP-driven value creation and localisation,” Ram told IANS.

India's electronics sector is set to harness $7 billion untapped revenue by 2035 via circular business model and policy pathways, say industry stakeholders.

Current commitments and targets set the projected market size for these circular models at $13 billion in 2035.

Yet, the total addressable market, achievable through the right public and private actions, can reach an astounding $20 billion, revealing an untapped potential of 35 per cent, according to the ICEA.

Three core business models -- Repair, Resell, and Recycling -- are already thriving in India, predominantly driven by the informal sector. Around 90 per cent of collection and 70 per cent of recycling are handled by this competitive sector.

However, only 22 per cent of the collected e-waste is managed by the formal sector, revealing room for improvement.

Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman, ICEA, highlighted the future potential of India's electronics sector as a global manufacturing hub.

“I am confident that the electronics industry would facilitate sustainable circular economy practices to ensure a sustainable green future for the generations to come,” Mohindroo said.

Meanwhile, the ICEA is also setting up a task-force to ensure that the current electronics trade between India and the US goes up from an estimated $8 billion to $100 billion in a decade.

“We are setting up a task-force to ensure that the current electronics trade between the two countries goes up from an estimated $8 billion to $100 billion in a decade. The role of lead firms of global value chains (GVCs) will be crucial but, at the same time, new jobs and opportunities for Indian businesses and startups will be created,” Mohindroo informed.

In September, US-based Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) started the construction of a Rs 22,500 crore facility in Sanand, Gujarat, that will set a benchmark for India’s semiconductor journey.

""This plant sets a major milestone for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a semiconductor hub — the way the country has achieved in sectors like mobile, electronics, defense, railways, aviation and multiple other areas where progress is visible,"" Union IT MInister Ashwini Vaishnaw had told IANS.

The engineering major Larsen & Toubro (NS: ) (L&T) has also announced to invest up to Rs 830 crore to build a fabless semiconductor chip design subsidiary which will ramp up the country's plan to become a semiconductor hub.

In just 15-16 months' time, India has seen the construction of its first-ever semiconductor plant in Gujarat, received more manufacturing proposals along with several chip-designing startups now operational in the country.

""This momentum is expected to continue in 2024, with India poised to become a major hub for consumer electronics manufacturing and a formidable export powerhouse,"" said Ram.

2022-12-16, IANS,PLI Scheme turns out to be a game changer for manufacturing sector,https://in.investing.com/news/pli-scheme-turns-out-to-be-a-game-changer-for-manufacturing-sector-3940483,"New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, launched by the Narendra Modi government in March 2020, has turned out to be a game changer in giving a big push to India’s manufacturing sector, employment generation and exports.

The country has for the first time emerged as a strong exporter of electronic goods with India-made smartphones of top global brands Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) spearheading the charge.

The PLI Scheme has led to major smartphone companies shifting their suppliers to India. These include Taiwanese giant Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron.

In another major breakthrough on the industrial front, work is on to set up a factory to produce semiconductors by US chip giant Micron (NASDAQ: ) Technologies near Ahmedabad.

There has been a 60 per cent surge in India’s electronic goods exports in April-October this year to $15.5 billion compared to 2022-23 when $23.6 billion worth of electronic goods were shipped out during the entire year.

According to DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, PLI Schemes resulted in a robust increase of 76 per cent in FDI in the manufacturing sector in FY 2021-22 (USD 21.34 billion) compared to previous FY 2020-21 (USD 12.09 billion).

The PLI scheme envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the objective of making India 'Aatma Nirbhar' is built on the foundation of 14 sectors with an incentive outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore (about US$ 26 billion) to strengthen the production capabilities and help create global champions.

Import substitution of 60 per cent has been achieved in the Telecom sector and India has become almost self-reliant in Antennae, GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) & CPE (Customer Premises Equipment). Drones sector has seen a 7 times jump in turnover due to the PLI Scheme which consists of all MSME Startups, according to data compiled by the Commerce and Industry Ministry.

Under the PLI Scheme for Food Processing, sourcing of raw materials from India has seen significant increase which has positively impacted income of Indian farmers and MSMEs.

There has also been a significant reduction in imports of raw materials in the Pharma sector. Unique intermediate materials and bulk drugs are being manufactured in India including Penicillin-G, and transfer of technology has happened in manufacturing of Medical Devices such as CT scan and MRI.

Sectors for which PLI schemes exist and have seen an increase in FDI inflows from FY 2021-22 to FY 2022-23 are Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (+46 per cent), Food Processing Industries (+26 per cent) and Medical Appliances (+91 per cent).

PLI Schemes have transformed India’s exports basket from traditional commodities to high value-added products such as electronics and telecommunication goods, and processed food products.

Over 700 applications have been approved in 14 Sectors with expected investment of Rs 3.65 lakh crore. There are also as many as 176 MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprise) among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharma, Telecom, White Goods, Food Processing, Textiles and Drones, official data showed.

Actual investment of Rs 62,500 crore has been realised till March 2022 which has resulted in incremental production and sales of over Rs 6.75 lakh crore and employment generation of around 3,25,000. Exports have been boosted by Rs 2.56 lakh crore till FY 2022-23, according to official figures.

An incentive amount of around Rs 2,900 crore was disbursed in FY 2022-23 under PLI Schemes for 8 Sectors viz. Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing (LSEM), IT Hardware, Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processing and Drones & Drone Components.

This has also resulted in a 20-fold increase in women employment and localisation in IT Hardware such as Battery & Laptops.

“We have been able to increase the value addition in mobile manufacturing to 20 per cent within a period of three years whereas countries like Vietnam achieved 18 per cent value addition over 15 years and China achieved 49 per cent value addition in over 25 years. Seen in this perspective, it is a big achievement,” says Rajesh Kumar Singh.

PLI Scheme for LSEM along with existing Phased Manufacturing Program has led to increased value addition in the electronics sector and in smartphone manufacturing to the tune of 23 per cent and 20 per cent respectively, from negligible in 2014-15.

Of the USD 101 Billion total electronics production in FY 2022-23, smartphones constitute USD 44 Billion including USD 11.1 Billion as exports, according to official figures.

The lawsuit, filed in 2019, alleged that “Apple misrepresented the ability to use its Family Sharing feature to share subscriptions to apps.”

“A settlement has been reached with Apple in a class-action lawsuit, alleging that Apple misrepresented the ability to use its Family Sharing feature to share subscriptions to apps,” according to the lawsuit.

Apple denied that it made any misleading misrepresentations and also denied all allegations of wrongdoing.

“The vast majority of subscription-based Apps, which is a growing percentage of Apple Apps, cannot be shared with designated family members,” the court document read.

“They are available only to the individual user who downloads the App and sets up a subscription. All or virtually all of these Apps, however, included the statement that they support Family Sharing on their landing pages through January 30, 2019,” it added.

The lawsuit alleged that Apple was aware that the subscription-based apps did not support Family Sharing, but still placed an ad for Family Sharing on them.

“The millions of consumers have downloaded subscription-based Apps believing that they are available for Family Sharing, only to learn after payment has been made that they are not so available,” it read.

2022-12-14, IANS,Apple will need court order from govts to give phone push notifications,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-will-need-court-order-from-govts-to-give-phone-push-notifications-3937065,"San Francisco, Dec 14 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will now require law enforcement agencies to obtain a court order before it hands over details of customers’ push notifications. Apple has updated its guidelines for law enforcement agencies, saying that search warrants and court orders are now required for it to give up “The Apple ID associated with” an Apple Push Notification Service token.

“The Apple ID associated with a registered Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token and associated records may be obtained with an order under 18 U.S.C. §2703(d) or a search warrant,” the company said in the update.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Google (NASDAQ: ) already have a policy to require court orders in place.

Last week, US Senator Ron Wyden warned in a letter written to the Justice Department that some unidentified governments around the world are spying on Apple and Google phone users through their push notifications. The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch last week that the company shares Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”

“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden,” according to Google.

According to Apple, when users allow an application they have installed to receive push notifications, an APNs token is generated and registered to that developer and device. “Some apps may have multiple APNs tokens for one account on one device to differentiate between messages and multi-media,” according to the company.

The new amount will bankroll additional capacity for Apple devices, including likely the iPhone.

With the most recent approval of spending, the Taiwanese firm will have allocated roughly $2.7 billion to the site.

Apple's key manufacturing partner, Foxconn, has increased its budget for the factory at least once this year. It began in early 2022 with intentions to invest only $700 million in the complex, which is located in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, Tata Group is planning to build one of India's largest iPhone assembly plants in Tamil Nadu (NS: )'s Hosur.

According to media reports, the facility is expected to feature around 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years. The site is expected to be operational within 12 to 18 months.

The move is considered as part of Apple's aim to expand manufacturing operations in the South Asian country. Tata already operates an iPhone manufacturing unit in Karnataka, which it purchased from Wistron Corp.

China considers Lai a traitor who sought to undermine its national security, the BBC reported.

According to the media mogul's legal team, he has been denied his choice of legal representation, after Beijing barred him from appointing a UK lawyer.

He is being tried by three judges handpicked by Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee, the team added.

Lai, an outspoken critic of the Chinese Communist Party, is one of the most high-profile people to be arrested under the NSL.

Before he was detained, he was often at the frontline of pro-democracy protests, such as the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the 2019 demonstrations against an extradition bill.

He founded and ran some of Hong Kong's best-known media outlets, including the now-defunct newspaper Apple (NASDAQ: ) Daily.

Lai is also facing a sedition charge under a colonial-era law based on his tweets, interviews he hosted, as well as articles published in Apple Daily, the BBC reported.

Since he is a British citizen, his son Sebastian Lai has been lobbying the UK government to intervene on his father's behalf.

Sebastian Lai also met UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron earlier this month.

On Sunday while calling for Jimmy Lai's release, Cameron said: ""I am gravely concerned that anyone is facing prosecution under the National Security Law, and particularly concerned at the politically motivated prosecution of British national Jimmy Lai.

""As a prominent and outspoken journalist and publisher, Jimmy Lai has been targeted in a clear attempt to stop the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association.""

Since his arrest in August 2020, Lai has been held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison for more than 1,000 days.

The trial, which has been delayed for a year, is expected to last for about 80 days.

With 23.4 million units and 21 per cent share, Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the global market, followed by Samsung (KS: ) and homegrown boAt.

Shipments of wireless headphones surpassed those of wireless earphones for the first time, predominantly due to vendors seeking stronger revenue drivers through wireless headphones and wireless earphones being replaced by TWS.

Alternative wearable forms, such as air and bone conduction devices, made up less than 2 per cent of shipments in the third quarter.

“The Q3 decline was partly caused by vendors’ strategic decision to skip yearly flagship releases, effectively extending refresh cycles following vendors prioritising premium models,” said Jack Leathem, Research Analyst.

In China, one of the fastest-growing players was Huawei, which leveraged its strong smartphone growth to cross-sell ecosystem devices, and consequently grew its shipments by 30 per cent compared with Q3 2022.

“We expect growth to return in Q4, driven by replenishing inventories and holiday shopping season deals,” said Leathem.

Improving economic conditions and expected flagship portfolio launches from Apple and Samsung should further boost the market in 2024.

2022-12-16, IANS,"Phones to chips, electronics sector buoyed by strong tailwinds",https://in.investing.com/news/phones-to-chips-electronics-sector-buoyed-by-strong-tailwinds-3940489,"New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The last 9-10 years have seen tremendous growth across four major consumer electronics segments -- mobile phones, consumer electronics, IT hardware and electronic components -- that account for over 70 per cent of India’s domestic manufacturing profile.

The pace is such that tech giants are now lining up investments worth billions of dollars in the country.

The country is rapidly becoming an electronics manufacturing hub, with the sector expected to rise to $300 billion by 2025-26. From Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Foxconn and US-based Micron Technologies to domestic major Tata Group, the companies are aiming to leverage domestic capabilities to achieve supply chain diversification and scale up production by manufacturing in the country.

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn has received approval to invest at least $1 billion more in a plant in India that will manufacture Apple products. The fresh investment is on top of the $1.6 billion it earlier set aside for the 300-acre site close to the Bengaluru airport.

Meanwhile, the Tata Group is planning to build one of India's largest iPhone assembly plants in Tamil Nadu (NS: )'s Hosur. According to media reports, the facility is expected to feature around 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years. The site is expected to be operational within 12 to 18 months.

With Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron selling its India operations to the Tata Group for $125 million, Tata Electronics is going to become the first Indian company to manufacture new Apple iPhones in the country, which is a major fillip to the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative.

According to reports, Apple plans to expand its investment in the country to approximately $40 billion over the next four to five years. Apple has already crossed the $7 billion production milestone during the previous fiscal year.

Apple is aiming to manufacture more than 50 million iPhones in India per year, as it aims to shift some of the production out from China. The tech giant aims to achieve the target within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned after that, according to the Wall Street Journal.

According to government and industry data, India saw mobile phones exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the ongoing fiscal year (FY24).

As per estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), accessed by IANS, the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year. The country is now the second-biggest manufacturing hub for mobile phones due to heavy investment from original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers and companies dealing in components and parts.

India is expected to export about 22 per cent of its total assembled mobile phones in 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

However, “China’s manufacturing and supply chain will still maintain its essential role in the longer run,” says senior research analyst Ivan Lam.

According to Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, India's domestic consumer electronics manufacturing sector has soared, propelled by a mix of strong tailwinds.

“A conducive policy environment is attracting strong investments, while a burgeoning R&D pool in areas like chip design and AI is fostering innovation. Domestic champions are leading the charge, prioritizing IP-driven value creation and localisation,” Ram told IANS.

India's electronics sector is set to harness $7 billion untapped revenue by 2035 via circular business model and policy pathways, say industry stakeholders.

Current commitments and targets set the projected market size for these circular models at $13 billion in 2035.

Yet, the total addressable market, achievable through the right public and private actions, can reach an astounding $20 billion, revealing an untapped potential of 35 per cent, according to the ICEA.

Three core business models -- Repair, Resell, and Recycling -- are already thriving in India, predominantly driven by the informal sector. Around 90 per cent of collection and 70 per cent of recycling are handled by this competitive sector.

However, only 22 per cent of the collected e-waste is managed by the formal sector, revealing room for improvement.

Pankaj Mohindroo, Chairman, ICEA, highlighted the future potential of India's electronics sector as a global manufacturing hub.

“I am confident that the electronics industry would facilitate sustainable circular economy practices to ensure a sustainable green future for the generations to come,” Mohindroo said.

Meanwhile, the ICEA is also setting up a task-force to ensure that the current electronics trade between India and the US goes up from an estimated $8 billion to $100 billion in a decade.

“We are setting up a task-force to ensure that the current electronics trade between the two countries goes up from an estimated $8 billion to $100 billion in a decade. The role of lead firms of global value chains (GVCs) will be crucial but, at the same time, new jobs and opportunities for Indian businesses and startups will be created,” Mohindroo informed.

In September, US-based Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) started the construction of a Rs 22,500 crore facility in Sanand, Gujarat, that will set a benchmark for India’s semiconductor journey.

""This plant sets a major milestone for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of making India a semiconductor hub — the way the country has achieved in sectors like mobile, electronics, defense, railways, aviation and multiple other areas where progress is visible,"" Union IT MInister Ashwini Vaishnaw had told IANS.

The engineering major Larsen & Toubro (NS: ) (L&T) has also announced to invest up to Rs 830 crore to build a fabless semiconductor chip design subsidiary which will ramp up the country's plan to become a semiconductor hub.

In just 15-16 months' time, India has seen the construction of its first-ever semiconductor plant in Gujarat, received more manufacturing proposals along with several chip-designing startups now operational in the country.

""This momentum is expected to continue in 2024, with India poised to become a major hub for consumer electronics manufacturing and a formidable export powerhouse,"" said Ram.

The country has for the first time emerged as a strong exporter of electronic goods with India-made smartphones of top global brands Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) spearheading the charge.

The PLI Scheme has led to major smartphone companies shifting their suppliers to India. These include Taiwanese giant Foxconn, Wistron and Pegatron.

In another major breakthrough on the industrial front, work is on to set up a factory to produce semiconductors by US chip giant Micron (NASDAQ: ) Technologies near Ahmedabad.

There has been a 60 per cent surge in India’s electronic goods exports in April-October this year to $15.5 billion compared to 2022-23 when $23.6 billion worth of electronic goods were shipped out during the entire year.

According to DPIIT Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh, PLI Schemes resulted in a robust increase of 76 per cent in FDI in the manufacturing sector in FY 2021-22 (USD 21.34 billion) compared to previous FY 2020-21 (USD 12.09 billion).

The PLI scheme envisioned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the objective of making India 'Aatma Nirbhar' is built on the foundation of 14 sectors with an incentive outlay of Rs. 1.97 lakh crore (about US$ 26 billion) to strengthen the production capabilities and help create global champions.

Import substitution of 60 per cent has been achieved in the Telecom sector and India has become almost self-reliant in Antennae, GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) & CPE (Customer Premises Equipment). Drones sector has seen a 7 times jump in turnover due to the PLI Scheme which consists of all MSME Startups, according to data compiled by the Commerce and Industry Ministry.

Under the PLI Scheme for Food Processing, sourcing of raw materials from India has seen significant increase which has positively impacted income of Indian farmers and MSMEs.

There has also been a significant reduction in imports of raw materials in the Pharma sector. Unique intermediate materials and bulk drugs are being manufactured in India including Penicillin-G, and transfer of technology has happened in manufacturing of Medical Devices such as CT scan and MRI.

Sectors for which PLI schemes exist and have seen an increase in FDI inflows from FY 2021-22 to FY 2022-23 are Drugs and Pharmaceuticals (+46 per cent), Food Processing Industries (+26 per cent) and Medical Appliances (+91 per cent).

PLI Schemes have transformed India’s exports basket from traditional commodities to high value-added products such as electronics and telecommunication goods, and processed food products.

Over 700 applications have been approved in 14 Sectors with expected investment of Rs 3.65 lakh crore. There are also as many as 176 MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprise) among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharma, Telecom, White Goods, Food Processing, Textiles and Drones, official data showed.

Actual investment of Rs 62,500 crore has been realised till March 2022 which has resulted in incremental production and sales of over Rs 6.75 lakh crore and employment generation of around 3,25,000. Exports have been boosted by Rs 2.56 lakh crore till FY 2022-23, according to official figures.

An incentive amount of around Rs 2,900 crore was disbursed in FY 2022-23 under PLI Schemes for 8 Sectors viz. Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing (LSEM), IT Hardware, Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom & Networking Products, Food Processing and Drones & Drone Components.

This has also resulted in a 20-fold increase in women employment and localisation in IT Hardware such as Battery & Laptops.

“We have been able to increase the value addition in mobile manufacturing to 20 per cent within a period of three years whereas countries like Vietnam achieved 18 per cent value addition over 15 years and China achieved 49 per cent value addition in over 25 years. Seen in this perspective, it is a big achievement,” says Rajesh Kumar Singh.

PLI Scheme for LSEM along with existing Phased Manufacturing Program has led to increased value addition in the electronics sector and in smartphone manufacturing to the tune of 23 per cent and 20 per cent respectively, from negligible in 2014-15.

Of the USD 101 Billion total electronics production in FY 2022-23, smartphones constitute USD 44 Billion including USD 11.1 Billion as exports, according to official figures.

Apple closed at $197.96, its highest daily close ever.

According to Citi, investors are now questioning whether Apple's stock can continue outperforming in the coming year.

Analysts note that the company is expected to achieve double-digit EPS growth of around 14% and FCF growth of approximately 11%, driven by ongoing gross margin expansion.

“We believe the bears on the stock are missing the structural gross margin expansion story driven by iPhone premiumization, acceleration in services sales, and the silicon insourcing benefit/favorable commodity prices that drove P/E multiple expansion this year, in our view,” analysts said in a note to clients.

“We expect the above trends to continue next year, and view AI Phones and Vision Pro adoption as potential upside catalysts.”

Along these lines, the analysts highlighted the following 3 reasons why Apple stock will outperform in 2024.

Services expected to continue outperforming amid expectations that digital ad budgets growth is set to accelerate in 2024; Apple suppliers, including Hon Hai, revised the outlook to be better than the original guidance for “significant growth”; and AI Phone and Vision Pro are upside catalysts.

""We believe Apple is best positioned to take advantage of AI adoption in smartphones with its superior “shared memory architecture” with AP/GPU microprocessors,” analysts concluded."

2022-12-14, IANS,Apple will need court order from govts to give phone push notifications,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-will-need-court-order-from-govts-to-give-phone-push-notifications-3937065,"San Francisco, Dec 14 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will now require law enforcement agencies to obtain a court order before it hands over details of customers’ push notifications. Apple has updated its guidelines for law enforcement agencies, saying that search warrants and court orders are now required for it to give up “The Apple ID associated with” an Apple Push Notification Service token.

“The Apple ID associated with a registered Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token and associated records may be obtained with an order under 18 U.S.C. §2703(d) or a search warrant,” the company said in the update.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Google (NASDAQ: ) already have a policy to require court orders in place.

Last week, US Senator Ron Wyden warned in a letter written to the Justice Department that some unidentified governments around the world are spying on Apple and Google phone users through their push notifications. The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch last week that the company shares Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”

“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden,” according to Google.

According to Apple, when users allow an application they have installed to receive push notifications, an APNs token is generated and registered to that developer and device. “Some apps may have multiple APNs tokens for one account on one device to differentiate between messages and multi-media,” according to the company.

The new amount will bankroll additional capacity for Apple devices, including likely the iPhone.

With the most recent approval of spending, the Taiwanese firm will have allocated roughly $2.7 billion to the site.

Apple's key manufacturing partner, Foxconn, has increased its budget for the factory at least once this year. It began in early 2022 with intentions to invest only $700 million in the complex, which is located in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, Tata Group is planning to build one of India's largest iPhone assembly plants in Tamil Nadu (NS: )'s Hosur.

According to media reports, the facility is expected to feature around 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years. The site is expected to be operational within 12 to 18 months.

The move is considered as part of Apple's aim to expand manufacturing operations in the South Asian country. Tata already operates an iPhone manufacturing unit in Karnataka, which it purchased from Wistron Corp.

X generated a little more than $600 million in advertising revenue in each of the first three quarters of the year, and is anticipating a similar performance in the current period, according to the report, citing sources.

The company earned more than $1 billion per quarter in 2022.

Joe Benarroch, X head of business operations, was quoted as saying that they are not “Twitter any longer and not measuring themselves by old Twitter metrics -- both in revenue and user metrics.”

The loans Musk took out to buy Twitter (now called X) was about $13 billion and the social media company has to pay about $1.2 billion in interest payments every year.

As big advertisers quit the platform and X cannot pay the interest on its loans or pay employees, then it could actually go bankrupt, the BBC reported earlier this month.

“But that would be an extreme scenario that Musk would surely want to avoid,” the report mentioned.

However, for a company he bought for $44 billion, bankruptcy might sound unthinkable but “it is possible”.

Disney and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are no longer advertising on X and Musk told companies to ""Go f*** yourself.”

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has confirmed that it is not advertising on X.

""We aren’t advertising on X as we’ve found other platforms to better reach our customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson was quoted as saying in reports.

The departure of Walmart adds to the growing list of firms leaving X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post last month (for which, he apologised).

Apple, Disney, IBM (NYSE: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ) and Warner Bros. Discovery are among the companies no longer buying ads on X.

Last year, around 90 per cent of X's revenue came from advertising.

Musk has warned that the loss of big advertisers would spell the end of X.

""If the company fails, it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupts the company."" he said.

Accordingly, this is suggesting a potential order cut from Apple (NASDAQ: ) for the iPhone 15 series in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2024. More precisely, analysts cut their iPhone 15 series estimate by 2 million to 89 million for the second half of this year.

Despite this, the impact of the order cut is expected to be milder compared to previous weak cycles due to a smaller mix towards the iPhone 15/15 Plus and sustained demand for the iPhone 13 and 14 lineup.

Analysts at JPMorgan now model a “higher 4Q23 EMS build despite factoring in iPhone 15 order adjustment, as our previous estimates were already more bearish vs supply chain expectations.”

The company said spatial video is a groundbreaking new capability that helps users capture life’s precious moments and relive those memories on Apple Vision Pro. The new capability will be available early next year.

""We’re setting a new bar for what’s possible, enabling users to record special moments just as they happened. Spatial videos are magical, and we can’t wait for users to experience them on Apple Vision Pro early next year,"" Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement.

With spatial video recording, users can leverage the advanced camera systems on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture their favourite moments in three dimensions.

Spatial videos are captured in 1080p at 30 frames per second in the standard dynamic range. Capturing spatial videos on an iPhone is as easy as capturing regular videos on an iPhone.

""With the Camera app open in Video mode, rotate the iPhone to landscape orientation, tap the spatial video icon, and then tap record. iPhone starts recording video from both the advanced Main and Ultra Wide cameras, and scales the field of view from the Ultra Wide camera to match that of the Main camera, which is then saved into a single video file,"" the company explained.

Moreover, users can find all of the spatial videos they capture within a new Spatial album in the Photos app, and all of their spatial videos will sync across their devices with iCloud.

On Apple Vision Pro, spatial videos can be played back in a window or expanded into an immersive view that transports users back to each moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering.

2022-12-12, IANS,Fortnite maker Epic Games wins antitrust battle against Google,https://in.investing.com/news/fortnite-maker-epic-games-wins-antitrust-battle-against-google-3933850,"San Francisco, Dec 12 (IANS) Fortnite maker Epic Games has won its antitrust battle with Google (NASDAQ: ) in a landmark case that went on for three years.The unanimous verdict by a US jury wraps up the legal battle between the tech companies. The jury found that Google turned its Play Store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, The Verge reported late on Monday.

Epic filed its lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging that Google Play Store practices violated US antitrust laws.

""Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world,"" Epic Games said in a statement.

""It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" the company added.

Wilson White, Google’s VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy, said the company plans to appeal the verdict.

""We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,"" White said in a statement.

""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" the Google spokesperson added.

Epic Games said that over the course of the trial, ""we saw evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores"".

Google imposes a 30 per cent tax on developers simply because they have prevented any viable competitors from emerging to offer better deals.

“And Google executives acknowledged in Court that their offer of a 26 per cent rate on third party payment options is a fake choice for developers,” said Epic Games.

Earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had won the long-drawn antitrust court battle in the US against Epic Games over its App Store policies.

The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the district court's earlier ruling related to Epic Games' antitrust claims in favour of Apple.

However, it also upheld the lower court's judgment in favour of Epic under California's Unfair Competition Law.

Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, as Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after the game maker intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases.

The Fortnite make said that the evidence presented in the Google case ""demonstrates the urgent need for legislation and regulations that address Apple and Google strangleholds over smartphones"".

With the new Journaling Suggestions API, third-party journaling apps can also suggest moments for users to write about.

Journal and the Journaling Suggestions API are available with the release of iOS 17.2, Apple said in a statement late on Monday.

“Journal makes it easy to preserve rich and powerful memories, and practice gratitude by intelligently curating information that is personal to the user, right from their iPhone. We’re making it possible for other journaling apps to offer the same personalized suggestions while maintaining the highest level of privacy,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.

Users can browse past entries, bookmark them, or filter for details like photos, workouts, places, and more. Scheduled notifications can help make journaling a consistent practice.

“Suggestions based on user activity include writing prompts to empower meaningful insights, and daily reflection prompts help users focus on gratitude, kindness, purpose, and more. Users control the type of content that appears in Suggestions and can create a journal entry with the Suggestions they choose,” said Apple.

In addition, developers can use the new Journaling Suggestions API to add personalized journaling suggestions to their apps, prompting users with moments to write about in a privacy-preserving way, so more people can benefit from journaling and the personalized, secure experience only iPhone can deliver.

“The Journal app is an exciting development for us because it introduces the benefits of digital journaling to a wider audience and ushers in a new chapter for the practice,” said Paul Mayne, founder of the journaling app Day One.

When iPhone is locked with a passcode, entries in the Journal app are encrypted.

Additionally, users can choose to enable secondary authentication, and lock the Journal app with their device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.

All Journal entries are end-to-end encrypted when stored in iCloud, so that no one but the user can access them, said Apple.

Apple stock is also reiterated as Wedbush’s Top Tech Pick for 2024.

“We believe Apple will be the first $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024 given the pace of growth and monetization we estimate for Cupertino over the next year,” analysts wrote in a client note.

“We believe Apple is heading into a strong holiday season over the coming weeks that should translate into iPhone 15 growth that exceeds Street estimates for the December quarter on the heels of strong upgrade activity within the US and China markets that is resilient despite the bear noise.”

Wedbush analysts state that recent Asian supply chain checks into the holiday season and early 2024 show no negative revisions around iPhone units. This suggests a consistently strong consumer demand environment for the iPhone 15.

Analysts express confidence in the 220 million to 230 million units target for FY24, and there is potential for upside if the current pace of upgrade activity continues into the March and June quarters.

Analysts also believe that the Street underestimates the underlying upgrade opportunity in China during the December quarter and FY24.

“We estimate right now there is north of 100 million iPhones in China in the window of an upgrade opportunity and despite Huawei and geopolitical headwinds, Apple is seeing a very healthy December quarter for iPhone 15 in mainland China,” they added.

Overall, analysts highlight a “golden opportunity” to own Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) for the next year.

“With a growing iPhone business again into 2024 on the heels of what we view as a new tech bull market beginning, Apple is poised to have a strong year ahead. In a nutshell, Apple is in a Rock of Gibraltar-like strong position heading into 2024 with the stage set for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino,” analysts concluded."

After Beeper Mini, an iMessage solution for Android, was blocked for users, Apple (NASDAQ: ) said last week that it took steps to protect its users “by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage”.

Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is an advocate for stricter antitrust laws, asked why Apple would restrict a competitor.

“Green bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage?” she posted on X.

“Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,” the Senator added.

The Beeper Mini app allowed a way for users to send blue-bubble iMessages directly from their Android devices.

For the past couple of days, the app experienced technical issues when users were unable to send and receive blue bubble messages, reports The Verge.

Beeper’s team were working to enable its app to continue to operate.

“Work continues to fix the issue causing the Beeper Mini outage. We know how hard this has been for those who loved using Beeper Mini, and we're extremely sorry for the inconvenience. We are feeling good, though, and hope to have good news to share soon,” the team said in a post on X on Sunday.

Apple had said in a statement that “we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe”.

“We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage,” said a company spokesperson.

These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.

“We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users,” said Apple.

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has confirmed that it is not advertising on X.

""We aren’t advertising on X as we’ve found other platforms to better reach our customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson was quoted as saying in reports.

The departure of Walmart adds to the growing list of firms leaving X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post last month (for which, he apologised).

Apple, Disney, IBM (NYSE: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ) and Warner Bros. Discovery are among the companies no longer buying ads on X.

Last year, around 90 per cent of X's revenue came from advertising.

Musk has warned that the loss of big advertisers would spell the end of X.

""If the company fails, it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupts the company."" he said.

Accordingly, this is suggesting a potential order cut from Apple (NASDAQ: ) for the iPhone 15 series in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2024. More precisely, analysts cut their iPhone 15 series estimate by 2 million to 89 million for the second half of this year.

Despite this, the impact of the order cut is expected to be milder compared to previous weak cycles due to a smaller mix towards the iPhone 15/15 Plus and sustained demand for the iPhone 13 and 14 lineup.

Analysts at JPMorgan now model a “higher 4Q23 EMS build despite factoring in iPhone 15 order adjustment, as our previous estimates were already more bearish vs supply chain expectations.”

Moreover, analysts project a “relatively conservative 1H24 EMS build, given weaker iPhone demand with a continued iPhone 15 order cut.”

“Investors remain more focused on the Android supply chain, in our view, as restocking momentum is expected to extend into 1Q24,” the analysts said."

The company said spatial video is a groundbreaking new capability that helps users capture life’s precious moments and relive those memories on Apple Vision Pro. The new capability will be available early next year.

""We’re setting a new bar for what’s possible, enabling users to record special moments just as they happened. Spatial videos are magical, and we can’t wait for users to experience them on Apple Vision Pro early next year,"" Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said in a statement.

With spatial video recording, users can leverage the advanced camera systems on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture their favourite moments in three dimensions.

Spatial videos are captured in 1080p at 30 frames per second in the standard dynamic range. Capturing spatial videos on an iPhone is as easy as capturing regular videos on an iPhone.

""With the Camera app open in Video mode, rotate the iPhone to landscape orientation, tap the spatial video icon, and then tap record. iPhone starts recording video from both the advanced Main and Ultra Wide cameras, and scales the field of view from the Ultra Wide camera to match that of the Main camera, which is then saved into a single video file,"" the company explained.

Moreover, users can find all of the spatial videos they capture within a new Spatial album in the Photos app, and all of their spatial videos will sync across their devices with iCloud.

On Apple Vision Pro, spatial videos can be played back in a window or expanded into an immersive view that transports users back to each moment in time, like a celebration with friends or a special family gathering.

2022-12-12, IANS,Fortnite maker Epic Games wins antitrust battle against Google,https://in.investing.com/news/fortnite-maker-epic-games-wins-antitrust-battle-against-google-3933850,"San Francisco, Dec 12 (IANS) Fortnite maker Epic Games has won its antitrust battle with Google (NASDAQ: ) in a landmark case that went on for three years.The unanimous verdict by a US jury wraps up the legal battle between the tech companies. The jury found that Google turned its Play Store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, The Verge reported late on Monday.

Epic filed its lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging that Google Play Store practices violated US antitrust laws.

""Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world,"" Epic Games said in a statement.

""It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" the company added.

Wilson White, Google’s VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy, said the company plans to appeal the verdict.

""We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,"" White said in a statement.

""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" the Google spokesperson added.

Epic Games said that over the course of the trial, ""we saw evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores"".

Google imposes a 30 per cent tax on developers simply because they have prevented any viable competitors from emerging to offer better deals.

“And Google executives acknowledged in Court that their offer of a 26 per cent rate on third party payment options is a fake choice for developers,” said Epic Games.

Earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had won the long-drawn antitrust court battle in the US against Epic Games over its App Store policies.

The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the district court's earlier ruling related to Epic Games' antitrust claims in favour of Apple.

However, it also upheld the lower court's judgment in favour of Epic under California's Unfair Competition Law.

Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, as Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after the game maker intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases.

The Fortnite make said that the evidence presented in the Google case ""demonstrates the urgent need for legislation and regulations that address Apple and Google strangleholds over smartphones"".

With the new Journaling Suggestions API, third-party journaling apps can also suggest moments for users to write about.

Journal and the Journaling Suggestions API are available with the release of iOS 17.2, Apple said in a statement late on Monday.

“Journal makes it easy to preserve rich and powerful memories, and practice gratitude by intelligently curating information that is personal to the user, right from their iPhone. We’re making it possible for other journaling apps to offer the same personalized suggestions while maintaining the highest level of privacy,” said Bob Borchers, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing.

Users can browse past entries, bookmark them, or filter for details like photos, workouts, places, and more. Scheduled notifications can help make journaling a consistent practice.

“Suggestions based on user activity include writing prompts to empower meaningful insights, and daily reflection prompts help users focus on gratitude, kindness, purpose, and more. Users control the type of content that appears in Suggestions and can create a journal entry with the Suggestions they choose,” said Apple.

In addition, developers can use the new Journaling Suggestions API to add personalized journaling suggestions to their apps, prompting users with moments to write about in a privacy-preserving way, so more people can benefit from journaling and the personalized, secure experience only iPhone can deliver.

“The Journal app is an exciting development for us because it introduces the benefits of digital journaling to a wider audience and ushers in a new chapter for the practice,” said Paul Mayne, founder of the journaling app Day One.

When iPhone is locked with a passcode, entries in the Journal app are encrypted.

Additionally, users can choose to enable secondary authentication, and lock the Journal app with their device passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID.

All Journal entries are end-to-end encrypted when stored in iCloud, so that no one but the user can access them, said Apple.

Apple stock is also reiterated as Wedbush’s Top Tech Pick for 2024.

“We believe Apple will be the first $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024 given the pace of growth and monetization we estimate for Cupertino over the next year,” analysts wrote in a client note.

“We believe Apple is heading into a strong holiday season over the coming weeks that should translate into iPhone 15 growth that exceeds Street estimates for the December quarter on the heels of strong upgrade activity within the US and China markets that is resilient despite the bear noise.”

Wedbush analysts state that recent Asian supply chain checks into the holiday season and early 2024 show no negative revisions around iPhone units. This suggests a consistently strong consumer demand environment for the iPhone 15.

Analysts express confidence in the 220 million to 230 million units target for FY24, and there is potential for upside if the current pace of upgrade activity continues into the March and June quarters.

Analysts also believe that the Street underestimates the underlying upgrade opportunity in China during the December quarter and FY24.

“We estimate right now there is north of 100 million iPhones in China in the window of an upgrade opportunity and despite Huawei and geopolitical headwinds, Apple is seeing a very healthy December quarter for iPhone 15 in mainland China,” they added.

Overall, analysts highlight a “golden opportunity” to own Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) for the next year.

“With a growing iPhone business again into 2024 on the heels of what we view as a new tech bull market beginning, Apple is poised to have a strong year ahead. In a nutshell, Apple is in a Rock of Gibraltar-like strong position heading into 2024 with the stage set for a renaissance of growth in Cupertino,” analysts concluded."

Williams said that she received numerous high heart rate alerts on her Apple Watch, and noticed that she was ""starting to feel short of breath"".

She then called her doctor, who advised her to go to the emergency room.

“Next thing I knew, they came in saying, ‘We need to do an emergency c-section. Is that okay?’ And I was wheeled out of my room and woke up at (University of Cincinnati),” Williams was quoted as saying.

Doctors were able to deliver the baby safely, but Williams herself was still struggling. She was diagnosed with a rare form of myocarditis, the report noted.

""Essentially what happened is her immune system got fooled into attacking her own heart as something that was external,"" Williams’ surgeon, Dr Louis Benson Louis IV, explained.

Williams was hospitalised for a month and continued to receive treatment from Louis. Both she and her child are doing well now, the report said.

Meanwhile, an Apple Watch's Cardio Fitness notifications have helped a healthy man by identifying a major heart issue.

A 40-year-old man who was wearing Apple Watch Series 6 kept receiving notifications for low VO2 max, reports AppleInsider.

Researchers at Shackler School of Medicine and Leviev Heart Center in Israel conducted tests on the man and diagnosed a major heart problem: familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy with greatly reduced left ventricular systolic function.

After Beeper Mini, an iMessage solution for Android, was blocked for users, Apple (NASDAQ: ) said last week that it took steps to protect its users “by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage”.

Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is an advocate for stricter antitrust laws, asked why Apple would restrict a competitor.

“Green bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage?” she posted on X.

“Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,” the Senator added.

The Beeper Mini app allowed a way for users to send blue-bubble iMessages directly from their Android devices.

For the past couple of days, the app experienced technical issues when users were unable to send and receive blue bubble messages, reports The Verge.

Beeper’s team were working to enable its app to continue to operate.

“Work continues to fix the issue causing the Beeper Mini outage. We know how hard this has been for those who loved using Beeper Mini, and we're extremely sorry for the inconvenience. We are feeling good, though, and hope to have good news to share soon,” the team said in a post on X on Sunday.

Apple had said in a statement that “we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe”.

“We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage,” said a company spokesperson.

These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.

“We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users,” said Apple.

NPI includes a tech company, such as Apple, collaborating with suppliers on the design and development of new products to ensure that the blueprints are feasible.

According to the report, engineering verification for a new iPad model will begin in mid-February of next year. In the second half of next year, the model will be available.

The ""iPad"", which starts at $449, is Apple's low-priced mainstream iPad. It was last updated in October 2022 with a complete redesign, larger display, USB-C port, A14 Bionic chip, 12-megapixel camera, and other features.

Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly aiming to manufacture more than 50 million iPhones in India per year, as it aims to shift some of the production out from China.

The tech giant aims to achieve the target within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned after that, reports the Wall Street Journal, citing people close to the development.

If Apple achieves this target, India would account for a quarter of global iPhone production. China will still remain the largest iPhone producer, the report mentioned.

2022-12-08, Investing.com,Apple target price raised to $220 by Morgan Stanley on services and iPhone 15 outlook,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-target-price-raised-to-220-by-morgan-stanley-on-services-and-iphone-15-outlook-93CH-3930879,"NEW YORK - Investment analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) have presented a bullish case for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., raising their target price for the tech giant's stock to $220. The increase reflects confidence in Apple's services sector and anticipated improvements in the gross margins of the upcoming iPhone 15, along with robust consumer interest in the company's Vision Pro technology.

Morgan Stanley's optimism is further buoyed by recent stability in iPhone production, which has shifted the focus toward recovery drivers such as service offerings, gross margin enhancements, and Edge AI capabilities. These factors are expected to contribute to market share gains and potentially reduce the time between iPhone upgrades for consumers.

The firm remains positive about Apple's competitive edge in managing its App Store, even as it faces potential regulatory challenges in the EU that may require accommodation of third-party app stores. Moreover, ongoing legal scrutiny concerning Google (NASDAQ: )'s agreements with Apple has not dampened the firm's outlook.

Despite concerns over waning iPhone demand in China and lower retention rates compared to 2013, near-term risks related to production cuts seem minimal. Morgan Stanley suggests that the accelerated iPhone upgrade cycle driven by Edge AI technology could lead to substantial revenue increases beyond current forecasts.

As of December 2022, amidst these favorable conditions, Apple has once again achieved a market capitalization of $3 trillion.

As part of this positive sentiment, Morgan Stanley has raised its price target for AAPL shares to $220.

The investment firm highlights Services, gross margins, and Edge artificial intelligence as key drivers for optimism.

“The macro backdrop remains challenging, but we're incrementally more positive on OW-rated AAPL as near-term risks now appear to be more limited/pushed out, and excitement around Edge AI, Services, and gross margin strength re-ignites the bull case,” analysts said in a note to clients.

The analysis suggests that Apple's strategic focus on services, advancements in AI, and sustained gross margin strength are pivotal in navigating the current market conditions and driving future growth.

A more positive stance comes despite Apple stock sitting just 3% below record highs after a 15% rally since late October.

“In our view, this recent outperformance has been a function of three factors: 1) a bias towards quality mega cap stocks during a period of elevated uncertainty, 2) strength in Services and gross margins offsetting well-known near-term iPhone unit challenges in China, and 3) growing anticipation around Apple becoming a key ""Edge AI"" enabler, as we hypothesized last month.”

“As we look forward, we expect these same three factors to remain tailwinds towards outperformance. However, we also believe two of the key cruxes of the bear thesis have weakened in the last week, with supply chain checks showing relative stability in iPhone builds, and the timeline of the DOJ vs. GOOGL trial being pushed out years, in our belief,” analysts added.

Bottom line, Morgan Stanley sees Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) well-positioned to continue outperforming over the next 12-18 months.

Despite challenges such as infrastructure issues and restrictive labor rules, Apple has been gradually increasing its reliance on India, diversifying its manufacturing beyond China.

Leading the expansion is Taiwan-based Foxconn, one of Apple's key suppliers. The success of Apple's initial foray into India has set the stage for this substantial expansion, the report noted.

This move aligns with a broader trend among companies seeking to reduce dependence on China for their supply chains. Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint are part of a strategy that includes Southeast Asia and South Asia.

This development comes as part of a broader strategy to reduce Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing and increase its production capacity in India.

The new facility, which is expected to become operational between late-2024 and mid-2025, will be located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. It represents a strategic move by Tata Electronics to enhance its presence in the technology manufacturing sector. The plan includes the launch of a new mid-sized iPhone assembly line within the next year and a half. In addition to this significant expansion, there are plans to open about a hundred Apple-exclusive retail stores across India.

This initiative is not only poised to create substantial job opportunities but also aligns with Apple's goal of diversifying its production base. Last fiscal year, India assembled over $7 billion worth of iPhones, accounting for nearly seven percent of Apple's global production volume. With the new facility in place, there are ambitions to increase this figure so that one-quarter of all iPhones sold worldwide will be manufactured in India.

The upcoming factory will complement Tata's existing operations at their current site in Hosur, which produces iPhone enclosures. As the current state-backed financial incentives are anticipated to end, both Tata and Apple might seek further government subsidies to support this new venture.

“The design of MLX is inspired by frameworks like PyTorch, Jax, and ArrayFire. A noteable difference from these frameworks and MLX is the unified memory model,” according to Apple on GitHub.

“Arrays in MLX live in shared memory. Operations on MLX arrays can be performed on any of the supported device types without performing data copies. Currently supported device types are the CPU and GPU,” the Apple ML research team added.

Awni Hannun of Apple’s ML team posted on X that just in time for the holidays, “we are releasing some new software from Apple machine learning research”.

“MLX is an efficient machine learning framework specifically designed for Apple silicon (i.e. your laptop!),” Hannun said.

MLX is a NumPy-like array framework designed for efficient and flexible machine learning on Apple silicon.

“The Python API closely follows NumPy with a few exceptions. MLX also has a fully featured C++ API which closely follows the Python API,” according to the Apple ML team.

Last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed that the company is investing quite a bit in AI and will do it responsibly for product enhancements over time.

Cook said that the company views AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies and they're integral to virtually every product that they ship.

“When we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then, you can go all the way to the life-saving features on the launch end of the phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI,” he told analysts during the company’s earnings call.

Cook said that Apple has work going on related to AI for quite some time.

“I'm not going to get into details about what it is, because we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit, we're going to do it responsibly and you will see product advancements over time,” the Apple CEO said.

The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Wyden said that Apple and Google can be “secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”

Last month, Apple sent ""threat notifications"" to individuals whose accounts are in nearly 150 countries, including in India. Apple is sending a team of experts to delve deep into the issue of some Indian politicians receiving threats notifications last month, warning them of state-sponsored hackers targeting their devices.

The threat notification probe is currently being conducted by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).

“Apple and Google should be permitted to be transparent about the legal demands they receive, particularly from foreign governments, just as the companies regularly notify users about other types of government demands for data,” Wyden wrote in the letter.

These companies should be permitted to generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice, to publish aggregate statistics about the number of demands they receive, and unless temporarily gagged by a court, to notify specific customers about demands for their data, he added.

The letter, however, did not specify which foreign governments have asked Apple and Google for push notification information. “Apple is committed to transparency and we have long been a supporter of efforts to ensure that providers are able to disclose as much information as possible to their users,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information and now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests,” the spokesperson added.

NPI includes a tech company, such as Apple, collaborating with suppliers on the design and development of new products to ensure that the blueprints are feasible.

According to the report, engineering verification for a new iPad model will begin in mid-February of next year. In the second half of next year, the model will be available.

The ""iPad"", which starts at $449, is Apple's low-priced mainstream iPad. It was last updated in October 2022 with a complete redesign, larger display, USB-C port, A14 Bionic chip, 12-megapixel camera, and other features.

Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly aiming to manufacture more than 50 million iPhones in India per year, as it aims to shift some of the production out from China.

The tech giant aims to achieve the target within the next two to three years, with additional tens of millions of units planned after that, reports the Wall Street Journal, citing people close to the development.

If Apple achieves this target, India would account for a quarter of global iPhone production. China will still remain the largest iPhone producer, the report mentioned.

For the past couple of days, the app experienced technical issues when users were unable to send and receive blue bubble messages, reports The Verge.

Apple said in a statement that “we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe”.

“We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage,” said a company spokesperson.

These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.

“We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users,” said Apple.

Beeper Mini uses a custom-built service to connect to iMessage through Apple’s own push notification service.

The startup claimed its process works with no compromise to encryption or privacy.

Beeper Mini founder Eric Migicovsky said that he simply didn’t understand why Apple would block his app.

“If Apple truly cares about the privacy and security of their own iPhone users, why would they stop a service that enables their own users to now send encrypted messages to Android users, rather than using unsecure SMS?” he was quoted as saying.

2022-12-08, Investing.com,Apple target price raised to $220 by Morgan Stanley on services and iPhone 15 outlook,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-target-price-raised-to-220-by-morgan-stanley-on-services-and-iphone-15-outlook-93CH-3930879,"NEW YORK - Investment analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) have presented a bullish case for Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., raising their target price for the tech giant's stock to $220. The increase reflects confidence in Apple's services sector and anticipated improvements in the gross margins of the upcoming iPhone 15, along with robust consumer interest in the company's Vision Pro technology.

Morgan Stanley's optimism is further buoyed by recent stability in iPhone production, which has shifted the focus toward recovery drivers such as service offerings, gross margin enhancements, and Edge AI capabilities. These factors are expected to contribute to market share gains and potentially reduce the time between iPhone upgrades for consumers.

The firm remains positive about Apple's competitive edge in managing its App Store, even as it faces potential regulatory challenges in the EU that may require accommodation of third-party app stores. Moreover, ongoing legal scrutiny concerning Google (NASDAQ: )'s agreements with Apple has not dampened the firm's outlook.

Despite concerns over waning iPhone demand in China and lower retention rates compared to 2013, near-term risks related to production cuts seem minimal. Morgan Stanley suggests that the accelerated iPhone upgrade cycle driven by Edge AI technology could lead to substantial revenue increases beyond current forecasts.

As of December 2022, amidst these favorable conditions, Apple has once again achieved a market capitalization of $3 trillion.

2022-12-08, Investing.com,3 reasons why Morgan Stanley expects continued Apple stock outperformance,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/3-reasons-why-morgan-stanley-expects-continued-apple-stock-outperformance-432SI-3930345,"Morgan Stanley has expressed a more positive outlook on Apple (AAPL) stock, citing a reduction in near-term risks and a shift in focus towards factors that could drive a fundamental recovery.

As part of this positive sentiment, Morgan Stanley has raised its price target for AAPL shares to $220.

The investment firm highlights Services, gross margins, and Edge artificial intelligence as key drivers for optimism.

“The macro backdrop remains challenging, but we're incrementally more positive on OW-rated AAPL as near-term risks now appear to be more limited/pushed out, and excitement around Edge AI, Services, and gross margin strength re-ignites the bull case,” analysts said in a note to clients.

The analysis suggests that Apple's strategic focus on services, advancements in AI, and sustained gross margin strength are pivotal in navigating the current market conditions and driving future growth.

A more positive stance comes despite Apple stock sitting just 3% below record highs after a 15% rally since late October.

“In our view, this recent outperformance has been a function of three factors: 1) a bias towards quality mega cap stocks during a period of elevated uncertainty, 2) strength in Services and gross margins offsetting well-known near-term iPhone unit challenges in China, and 3) growing anticipation around Apple becoming a key ""Edge AI"" enabler, as we hypothesized last month.”

“As we look forward, we expect these same three factors to remain tailwinds towards outperformance. However, we also believe two of the key cruxes of the bear thesis have weakened in the last week, with supply chain checks showing relative stability in iPhone builds, and the timeline of the DOJ vs. GOOGL trial being pushed out years, in our belief,” analysts added.

Bottom line, Morgan Stanley sees Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) well-positioned to continue outperforming over the next 12-18 months.

This plan aims to position India as the source for a quarter of the global iPhone production by the end of the decade, signaling a significant shift in Apple's supply chain strategy.

Despite challenges such as infrastructure issues and restrictive labor rules, Apple has been gradually increasing its reliance on India, diversifying its manufacturing beyond China.

Leading the expansion is Taiwan-based Foxconn, one of Apple's key suppliers. The success of Apple's initial foray into India has set the stage for this substantial expansion, the report noted.

This move aligns with a broader trend among companies seeking to reduce dependence on China for their supply chains. Apple's efforts to diversify its manufacturing footprint are part of a strategy that includes Southeast Asia and South Asia.

In addition to its iPhone production plans, Apple is collaborating with China's BYD to allocate product development resources for the iPad to Vietnam, the Nikkei reported.

The engineering verification for the iPad model is expected to begin around mid-February, with the product set to be available in the second half of the coming year.

This development comes as part of a broader strategy to reduce Apple's reliance on Chinese manufacturing and increase its production capacity in India.

The new facility, which is expected to become operational between late-2024 and mid-2025, will be located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu. It represents a strategic move by Tata Electronics to enhance its presence in the technology manufacturing sector. The plan includes the launch of a new mid-sized iPhone assembly line within the next year and a half. In addition to this significant expansion, there are plans to open about a hundred Apple-exclusive retail stores across India.

This initiative is not only poised to create substantial job opportunities but also aligns with Apple's goal of diversifying its production base. Last fiscal year, India assembled over $7 billion worth of iPhones, accounting for nearly seven percent of Apple's global production volume. With the new facility in place, there are ambitions to increase this figure so that one-quarter of all iPhones sold worldwide will be manufactured in India.

The upcoming factory will complement Tata's existing operations at their current site in Hosur, which produces iPhone enclosures. As the current state-backed financial incentives are anticipated to end, both Tata and Apple might seek further government subsidies to support this new venture.

 India: Report",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-informs-component-suppliers-to-source-iphone-16-batteries-from-india-report-3926504,"New Delhi, Dec 6 (IANS) In an effort to diversify its global supply chain and move manufacturing out of China, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has informed its component suppliers of its preference to source batteries for the upcoming iPhone 16 from Indian factories, media report said on Wednesday.According to the Financial Times, battery manufacturers, such as Desay of China, have been encouraged to establish new factories in India, while Simplo Technology, a Taiwanese battery supplier for Apple, has been asked to increase manufacturing in India for future orders.

Earlier this week, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said Japanese electronic parts maker TDK Corp will manufacture lithium-ion (li-ion) battery cells for Apple iPhones in India.

""Another big win for PM @narendramodi ji's visionary PLI scheme in shifting the mobile manufacturing ecosystem to India. TDK, a leading supplier of cells to Apple, is setting up a 180-acre facility in Manesar, Haryana to build cells for batteries which will be used in the #MadeInIndia iPhones,"" he wrote on X.

Companies like Desay and Simplo package the electric cells produced by TDK and their counterparts into modules and send them to assemblers such as Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, the report mentioned.

Foxconn plans to invest $1.54 billion in India. In a stock exchange filing, Foxconn said that the investment will help it fulfil ""operational needs.""

Meanwhile, Apple has asked the Indian government to exempt its existing iPhones from the requirement of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, as the Centre evaluates the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices.

In a meeting with the IT Ministry officials late last month, Apple told the officials that if such a rule -- similar to what has been proposed by the European Union (EU) to require devices to have universal charging ports -- is brought, it may hamper its domestic manufacturing plans, reliable sources told IANS.

Investing.com – Main U.S. indexes were mixed on Tuesday. Data on job openings in October hinted at easing of labor demand, fueling hopes the Fed would consider lowering interest rates before the middle of next year, but investors were cautious ahead of Friday’s official November payrolls number.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Take-Two (NASDAQ: ) Interactive Software (TTWO) stock fell 1.8% after the video game company released the first trailer for its highly-anticipated ""Grand Theft Auto VI"" title, saying it ""coming 2025"", later than previously expected.

Gitlab (GTLB) stock soared 13% after the open-source cloud repository company reported better-than-expected third quarter results and offered healthy guidance.

CVS Health (NYSE: ) stock rose 4% after the healthcare conglomerate forecast 2024 revenue above estimates, expecting to benefit from its expansion into healthcare services and strength in its insurance business.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) stock declined 0.1% after the drugs company forecast revenue growth of 5%-6% for the next year, as it banks on strong demand for cancer treatments Darzalex and Carvykti and resilient sales of blockbuster drug Stelara.

Ermenegildo Zegna (ZGN) stock rose 1.7% after the Italian fashion group said it aims to grow its sales on average by more than 10% annually over the medium term, with profit rising twice as fast, after it bought U.S. brand Tom Ford (NYSE: ) earlier this year.

Designer Brands (NYSE: ) stock slumped over 30% after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance, saying the footwear market has contracted for the first time since the pandemic amid unseasonably warm weather.

JM Smucker (NYSE: ) stock rose 5% after the food packaging giant slashed its full-year financial guidance, citing the impact of its $5.6 billion acquisition of Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: ), although it still posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter income.

Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) declined 2.8% after it announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) climbed 2.1% after data suggested App Store revenue increased 11.3% year-on-year in its fiscal first quarter. Analysts at BofA referred to the data, originally compiled by analytics firm SensorTower, as “promising” in a note to clients.

2022-12-05, IANS,Apple requests India to exempt older iPhones from common charger requirement,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-requests-india-to-exempt-older-iphones-from-common-charger-requirement-3925385,"New Delhi, Dec 5 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) has asked the Indian government to exempt its existing iPhones from the requirement of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, as the Centre evaluates the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices.In a meeting with the IT Ministry officials late last month, Apple told the officials that if such a rule -- similar to what has been proposed by the European Union (EU) to require devices to have universal charging ports -- is brought, it may hamper its domestic manufacturing plans, reliable sources told IANS.

According to the tech giant, if such regulation is implemented on older models of mobile phones, Apple may not be able to meet the PLI (product-linked incentive) targets.

Reuters was first to report about this development. When reached, Apple did not comment on it.

India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told IANS that the industry is completely aligned with the government in implementing a uniform charging port regulation in the country to reduce e-waste and promote ease of living for consumers.

""The mobile phone industry has already adopted the Type-C USB port for charging and 100 per cent of the new models launched and sold in India are with type-C. We are working with the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) for a smoother transition of all the notified products like mobile phones, laptops, and tablets, which will be covered under the regulation,"" he said.

The latest iPhone 15 series models have been launched with the USB-C port and according to Apple, “the design of the earlier products cannot be changed”. According to industry experts, Apple’s fortunes in India have primarily been tied to older-generation iPhones, as the masses are using old-generation iPhone models.

""An early transition to USB-C, including on older-gen iPhones, could potentially strain Apple's supply chain and hit its fortunes,"" Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group at CMR, told IANS.

In August, the Department of Consumer Affairs met industry representatives to evaluate the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices. In the meeting with Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh, the ICEA and other industry stakeholders discussed the viability of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, including mobile phones.

""The charging port ecosystem has largely become rationalised, with the vast majority of feature phones (375 million) using micro-USB, and vast majority of smartphones (500 million) using USB-C. Low power devices (such as hearables /wearables, Bluetooth speakers) are also moving towards USB-C for higher-end items,"" Mohindroo had said.

The government is aiming at the possibility of adopting a universal charger model for all electronic devices, and will set up a panel seeking views on the proposal.

Apple iPhone shipments saw a 68 per cent (year-on-year) growth in India in the first half of 2022, driven by iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 series. Apple is likely to garner 7 per cent market share in 2022, according to CMR data. The growth in the Indian smartphone industry has been primarily driven by the Apple ecosystem, which alone crossed a record $5 billion in exports from India in FY23.

While the now-cancelled arrangement between X and 11:11 Media was marketed as a broad collaboration, Musk targeted Hilton's recently-launched line of pink cookware.

“The ad campaign wasn’t super convincing tbh,"" Musk wrote. ""I don’t think Paris cooks a lot"".

In October, X CEO Linda Yaccarino highlighted the advertising arrangement on her own account, referring to Hilton as the ""queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV"".

“The queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV is #Sliving on X. @ParisHilton welcome to the @X family, we’re excited to launch an official partnership with you and your next-gen media company 11:11,” Yaccarino wrote at the time.

Musk’s jab at Hilton came shortly after a remarkable appearance at the New York Times’ DealBook summit.

At the Summit, when Andrew Ross Sorkin asked the X owner about pauses in advertising, Musk replied: ""Don't advertise."" ""You don't want them to advertise?"" Sorkin asked him. ""If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself,"" Musk said. However, he apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" ever social media post on Semitism.

2022-12-04, Investing.com,Apple's iPhone 15 sales to drive strong holiday season performance - Wedbush,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-iphone-15-sales-to-drive-strong-holiday-season-performance--wedbush-93CH-3924265,"CUPERTINO - Wedbush has highlighted Apple (NASDAQ: )'s robust performance at the start of this holiday season, propelled by impressive iPhone 15 cycle sales. Despite a slight 1.3% drop in Apple's share price today, the tech giant has reported a significant increase in iPhone revenues, which rose to $43.8 billion from the previous year's $42.6 billion. Additionally, Apple has seen its services revenue climb to $22.3 billion, a substantial increase from last year's $19 billion.

The positive outlook follows the dismissal of rumors that China might ban iPhones for state employees, a narrative analysts have deemed exaggerated. Apple's sales growth in mainland China remains solid, with the company noting strong gross margins as a key financial highlight. This news comes after CEO Tim Cook met with China's commerce minister, an engagement seen as beneficial for U.S.-China trade relations and Apple's continued success in the region.

Analysts at Wedbush have reaffirmed Apple as the top tech investment choice following the launch of the iPhone 15 and its strong sales performance extending beyond Black Friday. They addressed and dismissed speculations about China’s potential restrictions on iPhones for government employees, emphasizing China’s strategic significance in supporting Apple’s sustained growth.

In the dynamic world of technology, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). stands as a beacon of innovation and resilience. Wall Street analysts have been closely monitoring the Cupertino-based giant, dissecting every facet of its operations to forecast the trajectory of its stock amidst a complex competitive and regulatory landscape.

Performance in Different Markets

Apple's foray into various markets has been a tale of strategic positioning and calculated risks. In China, a key battleground, Apple navigated the competitive tides against local giants like Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ). Despite a slight decline in unit sales during Singles Day promotions, analysts point to supply constraints rather than a loss of market share as the culprit. Apple's premium pricing strategy, with an average selling price significantly higher than its competitors, has allowed it to capture a substantial portion of market revenue.

The termination of the partnership with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), involving the Apple Card and Savings account offerings, has been a recent blip. Analysts believe that while the financial results have not been significantly impacted, the future could hold a new partnership with different economic terms, possibly less favorable than before.

Product Segments and Details

Apple's product ecosystem, from iPhones to Mac computers, has been the core driver of its financial success. The iPhone, in particular, remains a dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones, with a strong and loyal customer base that supports sustained revenue. However, the competitive landscape is not static, with Huawei's resurgence potentially clawing back some of the market share.

The company's inventory levels, which have seen a significant increase above the 5-year median, raise questions about potential overstocking or slowing demand. Yet, analysts argue that these levels are in line with seasonal patterns, indicating managed growth and demand forecasting.

Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape for Apple is multifaceted. While it has shown resilience against Huawei in China, the potential for market share loss remains if competitors continue to grow aggressively. Supply constraints and a shift in consumer preferences towards lower-end models could also pressure hardware revenues.

Market Trends

Market trends have been both a boon and a bane for Apple. The company's focus on high-end devices with higher average selling prices has allowed it to earn significant market revenue. However, the overall performance of iPhones has been characterized as underwhelming, with Android sales showing better performance than initially expected.

Regulatory Environments

Regulatory scrutiny has been a thorn in Apple's side. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has partially attributed regulatory scrutiny to the Apple Card, and the ongoing Google (NASDAQ: ) anti-trust trial poses potential headline risks due to its default search engine deal with Google.

Customer Base and Management Strategy

Apple's customer base remains robust, with high brand retention and popularity among teenagers suggesting sustained future demand. The management strategy has been to incentivize direct sales, which may lead to higher margins and cross-selling opportunities.

External Factors and Upcoming Product Launches

External factors, such as geopolitical tensions between the US and China, have put pressure on Apple's stock. Despite this, Apple's expanding hardware and software ecosystem, along with leadership in accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, is anticipated to drive sales growth.

Upcoming product launches, including the iPhone 15 and other hardware equipped with new M3 chips, are expected to stimulate consumer interest and sales. The M3 chips, built with advanced 3nm technology, feature significant improvements in GPU performance, which could drive a switch from Intel-based models to in-house models due to better performance and integration with other Apple products.

Stock Performance

Apple's stock performance has been a subject of intense scrutiny. The company's market capitalization is a testament to its financial might, with figures fluctuating around the $3 trillion mark. Analysts have maintained a largely positive outlook, with price targets reflecting confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.

Bear Case

What are the main risks for Apple's future performance?

The loss of the partnership with Goldman Sachs could affect customer incentives and payment options. New partnerships may come with less favorable terms due to awareness of Goldman's losses. The potential for market share loss if competitors like Huawei continue to grow aggressively and supply constraints could limit sales performance and affect short-term revenue.

Could regulatory challenges significantly impact Apple's earnings?

Regulatory risks associated with the App Store revenue model could pose significant challenges. Economic slowdowns, particularly in China, could impact sales. Potential tariffs affecting imports could increase costs or affect supply chains. The ongoing Google anti-trust trial, if resulting in unfavorable outcomes, could risk a portion of Apple's net income.

Bull Case

How can Apple maintain its market dominance amidst competition?

Apple remains the dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones. The company has shown resilience despite supply constraints and competitive pressures. Apple's focus on high-end devices with higher ASPs allows it to earn a significant portion of market revenue despite lower unit share.

What growth opportunities does Apple have?

Emerging markets, particularly India, present huge untapped growth opportunities. The ecosystem of ~1.2B iPhones offers significant room for monetization through new services. Gross margins could structurally increase due to a higher mix of services and vertical integration.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Strong brand and market presence in high-end smartphones.

Diversified revenue streams with growth in services.

Robust customer loyalty and ecosystem stickiness.

Weaknesses:

Regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges.

Competitive pressures, especially in China.

Dependence on the success of the iPhone product cycle.

Opportunities:

Earlier this week, Union Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology Rajeev Chandrasekhar said Japanese electronic parts maker TDK Corp will manufacture lithium-ion (li-ion) battery cells for Apple iPhones in India.

""Another big win for PM @narendramodi ji's visionary PLI scheme in shifting the mobile manufacturing ecosystem to India. TDK, a leading supplier of cells to Apple, is setting up a 180-acre facility in Manesar, Haryana to build cells for batteries which will be used in the #MadeInIndia iPhones,"" he wrote on X.

Companies like Desay and Simplo package the electric cells produced by TDK and their counterparts into modules and send them to assemblers such as Taiwanese contract manufacturer Foxconn, the report mentioned.

Foxconn plans to invest $1.54 billion in India. In a stock exchange filing, Foxconn said that the investment will help it fulfil ""operational needs.""

Meanwhile, Apple has asked the Indian government to exempt its existing iPhones from the requirement of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, as the Centre evaluates the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices.

In a meeting with the IT Ministry officials late last month, Apple told the officials that if such a rule -- similar to what has been proposed by the European Union (EU) to require devices to have universal charging ports -- is brought, it may hamper its domestic manufacturing plans, reliable sources told IANS.

Investing.com – Main U.S. indexes were mixed on Tuesday. Data on job openings in October hinted at easing of labor demand, fueling hopes the Fed would consider lowering interest rates before the middle of next year, but investors were cautious ahead of Friday’s official November payrolls number.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Gitlab (GTLB) stock soared 13% after the open-source cloud repository company reported better-than-expected third quarter results and offered healthy guidance.

CVS Health (NYSE: ) stock rose 4% after the healthcare conglomerate forecast 2024 revenue above estimates, expecting to benefit from its expansion into healthcare services and strength in its insurance business.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) stock declined 0.1% after the drugs company forecast revenue growth of 5%-6% for the next year, as it banks on strong demand for cancer treatments Darzalex and Carvykti and resilient sales of blockbuster drug Stelara.

Ermenegildo Zegna (ZGN) stock rose 1.7% after the Italian fashion group said it aims to grow its sales on average by more than 10% annually over the medium term, with profit rising twice as fast, after it bought U.S. brand Tom Ford (NYSE: ) earlier this year.

Designer Brands (NYSE: ) stock slumped over 30% after the footwear retailer cut its full-year guidance, saying the footwear market has contracted for the first time since the pandemic amid unseasonably warm weather.

JM Smucker (NYSE: ) stock rose 5% after the food packaging giant slashed its full-year financial guidance, citing the impact of its $5.6 billion acquisition of Hostess Brands (NASDAQ: ), although it still posted better-than-anticipated second-quarter income.

Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) declined 2.8% after it announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) climbed 2.1% after data suggested App Store revenue increased 11.3% year-on-year in its fiscal first quarter. Analysts at BofA referred to the data, originally compiled by analytics firm SensorTower, as “promising” in a note to clients.

2022-12-05, IANS,Apple requests India to exempt older iPhones from common charger requirement,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-requests-india-to-exempt-older-iphones-from-common-charger-requirement-3925385,"New Delhi, Dec 5 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) has asked the Indian government to exempt its existing iPhones from the requirement of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, as the Centre evaluates the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices.In a meeting with the IT Ministry officials late last month, Apple told the officials that if such a rule -- similar to what has been proposed by the European Union (EU) to require devices to have universal charging ports -- is brought, it may hamper its domestic manufacturing plans, reliable sources told IANS.

According to the tech giant, if such regulation is implemented on older models of mobile phones, Apple may not be able to meet the PLI (product-linked incentive) targets.

Reuters was first to report about this development. When reached, Apple did not comment on it.

India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told IANS that the industry is completely aligned with the government in implementing a uniform charging port regulation in the country to reduce e-waste and promote ease of living for consumers.

""The mobile phone industry has already adopted the Type-C USB port for charging and 100 per cent of the new models launched and sold in India are with type-C. We are working with the Ministry of Electronics & IT (MeitY) for a smoother transition of all the notified products like mobile phones, laptops, and tablets, which will be covered under the regulation,"" he said.

The latest iPhone 15 series models have been launched with the USB-C port and according to Apple, “the design of the earlier products cannot be changed”. According to industry experts, Apple’s fortunes in India have primarily been tied to older-generation iPhones, as the masses are using old-generation iPhone models.

""An early transition to USB-C, including on older-gen iPhones, could potentially strain Apple's supply chain and hit its fortunes,"" Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group at CMR, told IANS.

In August, the Department of Consumer Affairs met industry representatives to evaluate the possibility of mandating a common charger for most devices. In the meeting with Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh, the ICEA and other industry stakeholders discussed the viability of a common charging port (USB-C) for electronics devices, including mobile phones.

""The charging port ecosystem has largely become rationalised, with the vast majority of feature phones (375 million) using micro-USB, and vast majority of smartphones (500 million) using USB-C. Low power devices (such as hearables /wearables, Bluetooth speakers) are also moving towards USB-C for higher-end items,"" Mohindroo had said.

The government is aiming at the possibility of adopting a universal charger model for all electronic devices, and will set up a panel seeking views on the proposal.

Apple iPhone shipments saw a 68 per cent (year-on-year) growth in India in the first half of 2022, driven by iPhone 14 and iPhone 13 series. Apple is likely to garner 7 per cent market share in 2022, according to CMR data. The growth in the Indian smartphone industry has been primarily driven by the Apple ecosystem, which alone crossed a record $5 billion in exports from India in FY23.

While the now-cancelled arrangement between X and 11:11 Media was marketed as a broad collaboration, Musk targeted Hilton's recently-launched line of pink cookware.

“The ad campaign wasn’t super convincing tbh,"" Musk wrote. ""I don’t think Paris cooks a lot"".

In October, X CEO Linda Yaccarino highlighted the advertising arrangement on her own account, referring to Hilton as the ""queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV"".

“The queen of pop culture, music, business, and TV is #Sliving on X. @ParisHilton welcome to the @X family, we’re excited to launch an official partnership with you and your next-gen media company 11:11,” Yaccarino wrote at the time.

Musk’s jab at Hilton came shortly after a remarkable appearance at the New York Times’ DealBook summit.

At the Summit, when Andrew Ross Sorkin asked the X owner about pauses in advertising, Musk replied: ""Don't advertise."" ""You don't want them to advertise?"" Sorkin asked him. ""If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself,"" Musk said. However, he apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" ever social media post on Semitism.

2022-12-04, Investing.com,Apple's iPhone 15 sales to drive strong holiday season performance - Wedbush,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-iphone-15-sales-to-drive-strong-holiday-season-performance--wedbush-93CH-3924265,"CUPERTINO - Wedbush has highlighted Apple (NASDAQ: )'s robust performance at the start of this holiday season, propelled by impressive iPhone 15 cycle sales. Despite a slight 1.3% drop in Apple's share price today, the tech giant has reported a significant increase in iPhone revenues, which rose to $43.8 billion from the previous year's $42.6 billion. Additionally, Apple has seen its services revenue climb to $22.3 billion, a substantial increase from last year's $19 billion.

The positive outlook follows the dismissal of rumors that China might ban iPhones for state employees, a narrative analysts have deemed exaggerated. Apple's sales growth in mainland China remains solid, with the company noting strong gross margins as a key financial highlight. This news comes after CEO Tim Cook met with China's commerce minister, an engagement seen as beneficial for U.S.-China trade relations and Apple's continued success in the region.

Analysts at Wedbush have reaffirmed Apple as the top tech investment choice following the launch of the iPhone 15 and its strong sales performance extending beyond Black Friday. They addressed and dismissed speculations about China’s potential restrictions on iPhones for government employees, emphasizing China’s strategic significance in supporting Apple’s sustained growth.

In the dynamic world of technology, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). stands as a beacon of innovation and resilience. Wall Street analysts have been closely monitoring the Cupertino-based giant, dissecting every facet of its operations to forecast the trajectory of its stock amidst a complex competitive and regulatory landscape.

Performance in Different Markets

Apple's foray into various markets has been a tale of strategic positioning and calculated risks. In China, a key battleground, Apple navigated the competitive tides against local giants like Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC: ). Despite a slight decline in unit sales during Singles Day promotions, analysts point to supply constraints rather than a loss of market share as the culprit. Apple's premium pricing strategy, with an average selling price significantly higher than its competitors, has allowed it to capture a substantial portion of market revenue.

The termination of the partnership with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), involving the Apple Card and Savings account offerings, has been a recent blip. Analysts believe that while the financial results have not been significantly impacted, the future could hold a new partnership with different economic terms, possibly less favorable than before.

Product Segments and Details

Apple's product ecosystem, from iPhones to Mac computers, has been the core driver of its financial success. The iPhone, in particular, remains a dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones, with a strong and loyal customer base that supports sustained revenue. However, the competitive landscape is not static, with Huawei's resurgence potentially clawing back some of the market share.

The company's inventory levels, which have seen a significant increase above the 5-year median, raise questions about potential overstocking or slowing demand. Yet, analysts argue that these levels are in line with seasonal patterns, indicating managed growth and demand forecasting.

Competitive Landscape

The competitive landscape for Apple is multifaceted. While it has shown resilience against Huawei in China, the potential for market share loss remains if competitors continue to grow aggressively. Supply constraints and a shift in consumer preferences towards lower-end models could also pressure hardware revenues.

Market Trends

Market trends have been both a boon and a bane for Apple. The company's focus on high-end devices with higher average selling prices has allowed it to earn significant market revenue. However, the overall performance of iPhones has been characterized as underwhelming, with Android sales showing better performance than initially expected.

Regulatory Environments

Regulatory scrutiny has been a thorn in Apple's side. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has partially attributed regulatory scrutiny to the Apple Card, and the ongoing Google (NASDAQ: ) anti-trust trial poses potential headline risks due to its default search engine deal with Google.

Customer Base and Management Strategy

Apple's customer base remains robust, with high brand retention and popularity among teenagers suggesting sustained future demand. The management strategy has been to incentivize direct sales, which may lead to higher margins and cross-selling opportunities.

External Factors and Upcoming Product Launches

External factors, such as geopolitical tensions between the US and China, have put pressure on Apple's stock. Despite this, Apple's expanding hardware and software ecosystem, along with leadership in accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, is anticipated to drive sales growth.

Upcoming product launches, including the iPhone 15 and other hardware equipped with new M3 chips, are expected to stimulate consumer interest and sales. The M3 chips, built with advanced 3nm technology, feature significant improvements in GPU performance, which could drive a switch from Intel-based models to in-house models due to better performance and integration with other Apple products.

Stock Performance

Apple's stock performance has been a subject of intense scrutiny. The company's market capitalization is a testament to its financial might, with figures fluctuating around the $3 trillion mark. Analysts have maintained a largely positive outlook, with price targets reflecting confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.

Bear Case

What are the main risks for Apple's future performance?

The loss of the partnership with Goldman Sachs could affect customer incentives and payment options. New partnerships may come with less favorable terms due to awareness of Goldman's losses. The potential for market share loss if competitors like Huawei continue to grow aggressively and supply constraints could limit sales performance and affect short-term revenue.

Could regulatory challenges significantly impact Apple's earnings?

Regulatory risks associated with the App Store revenue model could pose significant challenges. Economic slowdowns, particularly in China, could impact sales. Potential tariffs affecting imports could increase costs or affect supply chains. The ongoing Google anti-trust trial, if resulting in unfavorable outcomes, could risk a portion of Apple's net income.

Bull Case

How can Apple maintain its market dominance amidst competition?

Apple remains the dominant player in high-end Chinese smartphones. The company has shown resilience despite supply constraints and competitive pressures. Apple's focus on high-end devices with higher ASPs allows it to earn a significant portion of market revenue despite lower unit share.

What growth opportunities does Apple have?

Emerging markets, particularly India, present huge untapped growth opportunities. The ecosystem of ~1.2B iPhones offers significant room for monetization through new services. Gross margins could structurally increase due to a higher mix of services and vertical integration.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Strong brand and market presence in high-end smartphones.

Diversified revenue streams with growth in services.

Robust customer loyalty and ecosystem stickiness.

Weaknesses:

Regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges.

Competitive pressures, especially in China.

Dependence on the success of the iPhone product cycle.

Opportunities:

Expansion into emerging markets like India.

Growth in services and potential for new product categories.

Technological advancements, such as the M3 chips, driving product refreshes.

Threats:

Geopolitical risks, including US-China tensions.

Market saturation and consumer preference shifts.

Economic downturns affecting consumer spending.

2022-12-03, IANS,X may go bankrupt under Elon Musk if advertisers keep fleeing,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-go-bankrupt-under-elon-musk-if-advertisers-keep-fleeing-3922492,"London, Dec 3 (IANS) The loans Elon Musk took out to buy Twitter (now called X) was about $13 billion and the social media company has to pay about $1.2 billion in interest payments every year.

As big advertisers quit the platform and X cannot pay the interest on its loans or pay employees, then it could actually go bankrupt, the BBC reported on Sunday. “But that would be an extreme scenario that Musk would surely want to avoid,” the report mentioned.

However, for a company he bought for $44 billion, bankruptcy might sound unthinkable but “it is possible”. Disney and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are no longer advertising on X and Musk told companies last week to ""Go f*** yourself.”

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has confirmed that it is not advertising on X. ""We aren’t advertising on X as we’ve found other platforms to better reach our customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson was quoted as saying in reports.

The departure of Walmart adds to the growing list of firms leaving X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post last month (for which, he apologised last week). Apple, Disney, IBM (NYSE: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ) and Warner Bros. Discovery are among the companies no longer buying ads on X.

Last year, around 90 per cent of X's revenue came from advertising. Not any more. Musk has warned that the loss of big advertisers would spell the end of X. ""If the company fails, it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupts the company."" he said.

""What this advertising boycott is going to do is kill the company. And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company, and we will document it in great detail,"" Musk had told the audience at The New York Times' DealBook Summit.

In 2022, Twitter's advertising revenue was around $4 billion. Insider Intelligence estimates that this year, it will drop to $1.9 billion. After Musk’s outburst against big advertisers, X is reportedly aiming to tap small and medium businesses (SMBs) to offset the advertising loss from big companies.

A new report by The Financial Times has claimed X will now turn to SMBs to shore up revenue after Musk angered big brands by supporting antisemitic content.

“Small and medium businesses are a very significant engine that we have definitely underplayed for a long time,"" a company spokesperson was quoted as saying. “It was always part of the plan, now we will go even further with it,” the company added.

2022-12-02, IANS,Apple may add tetraprism zoom lens to both iPhone 16 Pro models: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-may-add-tetraprism-zoom-lens-to-both-iphone-16-pro-models-report-3922223,"San Francisco, Dec 2 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is likely to bring tetraprism camera technology to both iPhone 16 Pro models next year, which will enable at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom on the Telephoto lens.In order to assure manufacturing yields for the higher number of units necessary, Apple will add LG Innotek as another supplier of the folded zoom module utilised in the technology, reports MacRumors.

The news was first reported by The Elec.

The iPhone 15 Pro has a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera with 3x zoom, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max has an enhanced Telephoto system with 5x zoom.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max incorporates a folded glass structure beneath the lens, which Apple refers to as tetraprism technology. It reflects light four times over, allowing for a longer focal length of 120mm, the report mentioned.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has repeatedly stated that he expects the tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom to be included in both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year.

Meanwhile, Apple has released software updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to address two zero-day security vulnerabilities.

According to the company, the bugs were actively deployed in the wild.

""Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 16.7.1,"" the company wrote about both flaws in its security reports.

2022-12-01, Investing.com,Apple and Paramount in talks to bundle their streaming services at a discount - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-paramount-in-talks-to-bundle-their-streaming-services-at-a-discount--wsj-432SI-3921345,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount Global (PARA) are reportedly in early discussions to bundle their streaming services at a discounted rate, the WSJ reported today.

The potential combination would involve Paramount+'s content and Apple TV+, offering a more cost-effective solution compared to subscribing to each service individually.

Entertainment giants are increasingly exploring such partnerships to enhance affordability and appeal amid competitive pressures. Rising subscription prices have led to heightened customer churn, prompting companies to seek ways to retain subscribers.

Bundling services reduces the likelihood of cancellations, providing a strategic approach to combatting the trend of viewers unsubscribing after completing specific content.

The report comes after NBCUniversal’s Peacock teamed up with the grocery-delivery service Instacart to offer Peacock with ads access to Instacart+ subscribers without additional charges."

""Amid a global economic slowdown, most consumer device markets like smartphones are still experiencing stagnation compared to a year ago. In contrast, the smartwatch market has recorded year-on-year growth for two consecutive quarters in both premium and budget segments,"" said Research Analyst Woojin Son.

""Notably, High-level Operating System (HLOS) smartwatches, typically featuring higher specification and price, have grown largely driven by Huawei in Q3 2022 as the company posted its highest quarterly performance ever,"" he added.

According to the report, Apple (NASDAQ: ) delivered its best-ever Q3 performance, with a 7 per cent (year-on-year) increase in shipments.

Huawei recorded an impressive 56 per cent (year-on-year) increase in overall shipments for the quarter, with HLOS smartwatches seeing a remarkable 122 per cent surge. Fire-Boltt recovered its leadership position in India after recording its all-time highest quarterly shipments.

All three major Indian brands -- Fire-Boltt, Noise, and boAt -- are growing at a slower rate than before. However, this is seen as a sign of stabilisation rather than sluggishness, the report noted.

“Meanwhile, the Indian market, which has been powerfully leading the Basic smartwatch sector, maintained robust growth in the quarter. The country contributed to 35 per cent of total global shipments, securing its position as the leader in the global market for the third consecutive quarter,"" Son said.

Samsung (KS: ) experienced a 19 per cent (year-on-year) decline in shipments. However, the new products released in August exhibited only a 3 per cent drop compared to the previous ones, the report mentioned.

2022-12-01, Investing.com,UK High Court endorses CMA's right to investigate Apple,https://in.investing.com/news/uk-high-court-endorses-cmas-right-to-investigate-apple-93CH-3921230,"The UK High Court has reinstated the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) ability to continue its investigation into Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s market practices concerning mobile browsers and cloud gaming. This decision follows a series of legal challenges, with the most recent judgment by the UK Court of Appeal on Thursday, supporting the CMA's stance against Apple in a probe related to their market position.

The investigation, which originated in November 2022, faced a setback on March 10, 2022, when the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) sided with Apple, putting a temporary hold on the CMA's inquiry. However, the UK High Court later overturned this decision, affirming the CMA's authority to conduct multiple investigations if they serve the principal purpose of promoting competition and protecting consumers, as outlined in the Enterprise Act 2002.

The court's unanimous ruling, which included Lord Justice Green, Lord Justice Arnold, and the Chancellor, emphasized that there is no overarching principle limiting regulatory bodies to a single investigation into a company's market behavior. This principle supports the CMA's mandate to scrutinize potential anti-competitive practices within Apple’s operations.

The CMA's Chief Executive, Sarah Cardell, has welcomed the decision, signaling readiness to proceed with the inquiry after the legal process is completed. Apple has yet to comment on the judgment or indicate whether they will escalate the matter to the UK Supreme Court.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,"Amkor to build advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona; worked closely with Apple",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amkor-to-build-advanced-packaging-and-test-facility-in-peoria-arizona-worked-closely-with-apple-432SI-3919960,"Amkor (NASDAQ: ) Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMKR) announced its plan to build an advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona. By the time of full project completion, Amkor projects to invest approximately $2 billion and employ approximately 2,000 people at the new facility.

Amkor is the only US-headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider with advanced packaging technology capability and high-volume manufacturing experience. Upon completion, this will be the largest outsourced advanced packaging facility in the US.

""Expansion of a US semiconductor supply chain is underway, and as the largest US-headquartered advanced packaging company, we are excited to lead the charge in bolstering America’s advanced packaging capabilities,"" said Giel Rutten, Amkor’s president and chief executive officer. “Semiconductor companies, foundries, and other supply chain partners understand the need to strategically broaden their geographic footprint. The announcement of our new advanced packaging and test facility in Arizona is a clear signal of our intent to help our customers ensure resilient supply chains and be a part of a strong American semiconductor ecosystem.”

In recent Congressional testimony, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo highlighted advanced packaging as a major area of focus for the US government’s effort to rebuild American semiconductor manufacturing. The Commerce Department made clear that developing robust advanced manufacturing capacity and capability is a key priority and essential to the success of the CHIPS program.

Amkor has secured approximately 55 acres of land with intent to build a state-of-the-art manufacturing campus with more than 500,000 square feet of clean room space. The first phase of the manufacturing plant is targeted to be ready for production within the next two to three years. Amkor plans to provide high volume, leading-edge technologies for advanced packaging and testing of semiconductors to support critical markets such as high-performance computing, automotive, and communications.

Amkor worked closely with Apple (NASDAQ: ) on the strategic vision and initial manufacturing capability of the Peoria facility, which will package and test chips produced for Apple at the nearby TSMC fab. When the new facility opens, Apple will be its first and largest customer.

Amkor first established its presence in the Greater Phoenix area in 1984 and is excited to expand its footprint in the evolving Arizona semiconductor industry. The new manufacturing location will uniquely position Amkor among a strong ecosystem of front-end fabs, IDMs, and suppliers with current or expanding presence in the area, including TSMC, Intel, Applied Materials, ASML and others.

The project has garnered strong support from the City of Peoria, the Arizona Commerce Authority, and government authorities as it expands the evolving semiconductor ecosystem, provides high-tech jobs, and increases economic energy in the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area.

To ensure the success of a project of this magnitude in the United States, Amkor has applied for CHIPS funding. The CHIPS and Science Act was established to boost US competitiveness, innovation, and national security in the semiconductor industry. As part of the $52.7 billion program, the federal government will award $39 billion to US companies in competitive grants to manufacturers to finance construction, expansion, and modernization of facilities and equipment. These funds will be critical to Amkor’s project moving forward.

“Amkor’s $2 billion project—one of the largest microchip investments announced in Arizona since the passage of the CHIPS Act last year—will create good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and help protect our national security,” Arizona Senator Mark Kelly said. “As one of the first advanced packaging facilities in the US, this is a huge step forward to reducing dependence on other countries in the microchip supply chain. When negotiating the CHIPS and Science Act, one of my top priorities was making sure companies like Amkor had the support needed to develop a resilient supply chain in places like Arizona that are leading the way in bringing microchip manufacturing back to America.”

“Amkor’s announcement is a historic step forward for Arizona that will bolster America’s national security and build a more resilient supply chain, bring billions of dollars into our state, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for Arizona workers,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “With this project, one of the most significant investments in advanced packaging in America, Arizona will solidify itself as a world leader in the semiconductor industry. I was glad to meet with the Arizona Commerce Authority and Amkor leadership in South Korea to discuss future investments in Arizona and am proud to have them as a partner. Together, we’ll continue to expand the semiconductor ecosystem and continue Arizona’s long history of leadership in the advanced manufacturing sector.”

“Amkor has been a strategic OSAT partner to TSMC for many years,” said Dr. CC Wei, Chief Executive Officer of TSMC. “TSMC applauds Amkor for investing in the future of the semiconductor industry with us in Arizona. We share Amkor’s excitement for its significant investment and the value this facility will bring to TSMC, our customers, and the ecosystem.”

""Apple is committed to help build a new era of advanced manufacturing, right here in the US,” said Jeff Williams, Apple chief operating officer. “Apple and Amkor have worked together for more than a decade packaging chips used extensively in all Apple products, and we are thrilled that this partnership will now deliver the largest OSAT advanced packaging facility in the United States.”

“This new US facility, in combination with our advanced facilities spanning Asia and Europe, further strengthens our broad geographic footprint, supporting global but also enabling regional supply chains,” added Rutten. “This investment will reinforce our leadership position in advanced packaging and test within the key markets we serve while solidifying our commitment to expanding US-based chip manufacturing.”"
2022-11-30, IANS,Apple unveils ‘Lost Voice’ film to showcase 2 new accessibility features,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-lost-voice-film-to-showcase-2-new-accessibility-features-3919915,"New Delhi, Nov 30 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday unveiled a heartwarming film titled ‘Lost Voice’ which puts the spotlight on two new accessibility features that were recently rolled out, ahead of International Day for People with Disabilities that falls on December 3.The features — Personal Voice and Live Speech — were rolled out with iOS 17 and illustrate how powerful they can be through a beautiful story.

Millions of people are at risk of losing their ability to speak due to a wide range of conditions such as muscular dystrophy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known internationally as motor neurone disease (MND).

“Personal Voice uses secure on-device machine learning to sample and recreate your own voice, which means if you ever subsequently lose the ability to speak, you can continue to communicate through your iPhone, iPad or Mac (using another new feature called Live Speech) — and still sound like you,” according to Apple.

The film tells the tale of a young girl and her pink, floppy-eared furry friend, as they search high and low for his missing voice, before revealing a uniquely personal moment between a father and a daughter. It is narrated entirely with Personal Voice, generated on iPhone.

The film was cast with a genuine user of Personal Voice to narrate and play the role of the father: Dr. Tristram Ingham.

Ingham is a physician, associate professor of epidemiology and a disability advocate from Wellington, New Zealand.

He has facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which causes progressive muscle degeneration starting in the face, shoulders, and arms, and can ultimately lead to an inability to speak.

Personal Voice as a technology enables Ingham to preserve and continue to use his own voice well into the future.

For the shoot, Apple enlisted Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi.

2022-11-30, IANS,Global smartphone shipments to hit lowest level in decade this year,https://in.investing.com/news/global-smartphone-shipments-to-hit-lowest-level-in-decade-this-year-3919853,"New Delhi, Nov 30 (IANS) Global smartphone shipments in 2022 are projected to decline 5 per cent (year-on-year) to reach 1.2 billion, the lowest level in almost a decade, a new report showed on Thursday. However, the shipments are expected to increase by 3 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter this year to reach 312 million units, according to Counterpoint Research.

North America (NAM) and Europe’s shipments are expected to remain stagnant. However, China and emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and India have managed to break out from their declines and will recover to become the new drivers of growth in the smartphone market from Q4 2022 onwards.

""India, maintaining its momentum for premiumisation, is expected to become Apple’s new growth focus. Apple’s India shipments are predicted to grow 23 per cent YoY in 2024,” said Associate Director Liz Lee said.

“However, due to its underperformance against Huawei in China, Apple’s global market share will unavoidably decline slightly YoY in Q4 2022 and across 2024,” Lee added.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), the usual market leader in Q4 with its newly launched series, is expected to record a volume decline of 3 per cent YoY in Q4 2022, mainly due to Huawei’s aggressive expansion in China and prolonged delay in smartphone upgrades in Japan.

However, Apple will try to offset the underperformance in volume terms by growing in value terms with a better product mix.

After destocking efforts end with a relatively healthy inventory by the year-end, smartphone shipments in 2024 are projected to grow by 3 per cent YoY, said the report.

""We can also expect a recovery focused on emerging markets, backed by increasing consumer confidence and improving macroeconomic conditions,"" it added.

Huawei, driven by its newly launched Mate 60 5G series and older P-series 4G devices, recorded an enormous success in Q3 2022.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,Apple extends Qualcomm contract to 2026 amid modem development hurdles,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-extends-qualcomm-contract-to-2026-amid-modem-development-hurdles-93CH-3918820,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has decided to extend its contract with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for key technology components until 2026, signaling a wind down in its plans to produce its own modems for iPhones and certain iPads. Despite acquiring Intel (NASDAQ: )'s modem division in 2019 for $1 billion under CEO Tim Cook's direction, Apple has faced persistent challenges in software and hardware development that have hindered its progress.

The tech giant's endeavors to enhance modem speed began in 2018 but have yet to yield the anticipated breakthroughs, prompting a reduction in investment. This development contrasts with Apple's successful in-house production shift, notably the transition to Apple Silicon, which has significantly benefitted its product lineup, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

This strategic pivot underscores the difficulties Apple has encountered in its quest for production autonomy. The reliance on Qualcomm as a supplier for crucial components is expected to continue, as the setbacks in Apple's own modem project suggest that the company is not yet ready to sever ties with its long-standing partner. The news, shared by industry insiders yeux1122 and @Tech_Reve on X (formerly Twitter), indicates a notable shift from Apple's usual approach of internalizing production to maintain control over its technology ecosystem.

InvestingPro Insights

As Apple Inc. renews its partnership with Qualcomm Inc ., it's worth noting the financial health and market performance of both companies to understand the broader context of this decision. According to InvestingPro data, Apple is currently trading at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30.7, suggesting a strong investor confidence in its earnings potential despite a slight revenue decline of -2.8% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2022. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting Apple's high earnings quality, as its free cash flow continues to exceed net income, indicating robust financial health.

On the other hand, Qualcomm, a prominent player in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, has a P/E ratio of 19.78, reflecting a more moderate valuation by the market. Notably, Qualcomm exhibits a strong return on assets at 14.46%, supporting an InvestingPro Tip that recognizes the company's high return on invested capital.

For readers interested in a deeper analysis, InvestingPro offers additional insights into both Apple and Qualcomm's financial metrics and future prospects. Subscribers can access a comprehensive list of 21 InvestingPro Tips for Apple and 14 for Qualcomm, which include evaluations of dividend reliability, debt levels, and profitability forecasts.

2022-11-30, IANS,"Musk tells advertisers to 'go f*** yourself', apologises for anti-Semitic tweet",https://in.investing.com/news/musk-tells-advertisers-to-go-f-yourself-apologises-for-antisemitic-tweet-3918807,"San Francisco, Nov 30 (IANS) X owner Elon Musk stunned the world when he told advertisers to ""go f*** yourself"" late on Wednesday, after some top companies pulled advertising on his platform over his endorsement of anti-Semitism. Speaking at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, when Andrew Ross Sorkin asked the X owner about pauses in advertising, Musk replied, ""Don't advertise.""

""You don't want them to advertise?"" Sorkin asked him.

""If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself,"" Musk said.

He then waved to the audience, saying, ""Hey Bob,"" referring to Disney CEO Bob Iger who was also present at the event.

""What this advertising boycott is going to do is kill the company. And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company, and we will document it in great detail,"" he told the audience.

Musk made the remarks as the X CEO Linda Yaccarino sat in the audience.

Musk, in his first interview with mainstream media since his anti-Semitic post, however apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" ever social media post on Semitism.

""I mean, look, I'm sorry for that post. It was foolish of me. Of the 30,000 it might be literally the worst and dumbest post I've ever done,"" he said.

Companies that have paused or pulled advertising on X in the last few weeks include Apple (NASDAQ: ), Comcast/NBCUniversal, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, IBM (NYSE: ), Paramount Global, Lionsgate and the European Commission, as Musk promoted anti-Semitic content on X.

More than 100 brands have since halted their ads, and the company is at risk of losing $75 million by the end of the year, according to reports.

Market Performance and Product Segments

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the renowned technology behemoth, continues to dominate headlines and investor analyses, with its diverse product lineup and strategic market positioning garnering attention. As the company maneuvers through the competitive landscape, its performance in different markets and detailed breakdown of product segments remain critical for potential investors.

Analysts have scrutinized Apple's inventory levels, noting a seasonal increase in line with expectations. However, some caution is warranted as inventory days are significantly higher than the median, potentially indicating overstocking or a slowdown in demand. Despite these concerns, Apple's resilience is evident in its ability to navigate supply constraints and competitive pressures, especially in the high-end smartphone segment in China.

Apple's average selling price (ASP) in China stands out, significantly higher than its competitors, which allows the company to capture a substantial market revenue share despite a lower unit share. The company's focus on premium devices with higher ASPs has been a strategic move to sustain revenue, supported by a loyal customer base and less price sensitivity among high-end buyers.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

In the competitive landscape, Apple has shown remarkable resilience, particularly in China, where it remains the dominant player in high-end smartphones. Despite the competition from Huawei, Apple's market share increased to 39% in 2022, while Huawei's market share was affected by the US ban. Analysts believe that concerns around competition from Huawei are overstated and maintain a positive outlook on Apple's premium market positioning.

However, the potential for market share loss exists if competitors like Huawei continue to grow aggressively. Supply constraints could also limit sales performance and affect short-term revenue. The risk from Huawei is considered overstated by some analysts, who believe that Apple's decline in unit sales is more likely due to supply constraints rather than a loss of market share.

Looking ahead, Apple is gearing up for upcoming product launches, including the much-anticipated iPhone 15. The company's strategy of maximizing gross profit per unit through a migration to premium phones and related services, rather than volume, is expected to continue driving its financial success.

Regulatory Environments and External Factors

Regulatory challenges pose potential risks to Apple's revenue model, especially concerning the App Store. Economic slowdowns, particularly in China, could impact sales, and potential tariffs affecting imports could increase costs or affect supply chains. The ongoing Google (NASDAQ: ) anti-trust trial poses potential headline risks for Apple due to its default search engine deal with Google, estimated at around $12B in payments to Apple.

Management and Strategy

Under Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has successfully navigated US-China geopolitics, maintaining a strong brand image and customer loyalty within its ecosystem. The company's management strategy focuses on sustaining its market position through innovation, service growth, and strategic financial management.

Analyst Outlooks and Projections

Analysts maintain a range of views on Apple's stock, with price targets reflecting the company's growth prospects, quality of earnings, competitive moat, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Despite some near-term headwinds, the consensus remains positive, with expectations of revenue growth and a modest re-rating of shares.

Bear Case

Can Apple withstand the competitive pressure from Huawei?

The bear case for Apple centers on the potential market share loss to Huawei, which has re-entered the high-end smartphone market with technologically advanced offerings. While Apple's ecosystem stickiness and brand aspiration are significant factors in retaining customers, the worst-case scenario of market share loss to Huawei could result in a single-digit percentage impact on Apple's revenue and earnings.

Will Apple's investment in A.I. affect profitability?

Another emerging bear case revolves around Apple's investment in Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). With the technology sector's rapid advancements in A.I., Apple's capital expenditures in this area are seen as bearish due to the potential negative impact on free cash flow (FCF). Analysts express concerns over the increased competition and pricing pressures, as well as the necessity to ramp up the software/services business successfully.

Bull Case

How will new product launches impact Apple's revenue growth?

The bull case for Apple is buoyed by the anticipated success of the iPhone 15 upgrade cycle and the launch of new products equipped with the M3 chip family. Supply chain checks suggest initial iPhone units could be around 85 million, potentially reaching 90 million due to carrier promotions. The iPhone Pro Max's price remaining unchanged is expected to drive an additional 8 to 10 million units globally during this launch cycle.

Can Apple's services segment sustain double-digit growth?

Apple's services business is projected to return to double-digit growth in the coming quarters, with market share gains in China expected to contribute to overall momentum. The strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 15, higher average selling prices due to a shift towards more expensive models, and continued market share gains, especially in China, support a positive outlook.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Strong brand loyalty and market presence.

Diversified revenue streams with growth in services like the App Store.

Resilience in job creation within China may protect against harsh regulatory actions.

Weaknesses:

Geopolitical risks could lead to further restrictions or bans impacting sales.

A slowdown in the Chinese economy could affect demand for Apple products.

Regulatory risks related to the App Store revenue model.

Opportunities:

New product launches could lead to increased consumer interest and sales growth.

Advancements in technology like GenAI Siri could enhance user experience and brand loyalty.

Threats:

Legal risks from the DOJ trial may pose uncertainties for the company's future revenue streams and partnerships.

Competition from Huawei and other smartphone manufacturers.

Evercore ISI: Outperform rating with a price target of $210.00 (November 2022).

Bernstein Research: Market-Perform rating with a price target of $195.00 (November 2022).

Deutsche Bank (ETR: ): Buy rating with a price target of $200.00 (November 2022).

KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.: Sector Weight rating with a fair value of $182.00 (October 2022).

The timeframe for this analysis spans from September to November 2022.

InvestingPro Insights

Apple Inc. continues to be a focal point for investors and analysts alike, offering a compelling mix of innovation and financial performance. According to InvestingPro data, Apple boasts a substantial market capitalization of $2.96 trillion, underlining its status as a heavyweight in the technology sector. With a P/E ratio of 30.81 and adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2022 sitting at 30.53, the company's valuation reflects its robust earnings capacity.

Despite a slight revenue contraction of 2.8% over the last twelve months as of Q4 2022, Apple's gross profit margin remains impressive at 44.13%, showcasing the company's ability to maintain profitability even in the face of revenue headwinds. This financial resilience is further underscored by a strong operating income margin of 29.82% for the same period.

InvestingPro Tips highlight Apple's high earnings quality, with free cash flow surpassing net income, suggesting a solid financial foundation. The company also yields a high return on invested capital, which is indicative of efficient use of investor funds. Moreover, with a history of raising its dividend for 12 consecutive years, Apple demonstrates a commitment to shareholder returns. It's important to note, however, that 13 analysts have revised their earnings expectations downwards for the upcoming period, which may warrant investor caution.

Additionally, the tech giant displayed search ads not only on its own platform but also on third-party websites within the ""Google Search Partner network"", including YouTube.

The report further found that the company was showing ads on websites alongside explicit and pirated content and that ads, for instance, for the US Secret Service, FBI, and the US Treasury, were found on a Russian and an Iranian-sanctioned website.

""These included websites such as Breitbart.com, sites containing pirated content, hardcore pornographic sites, and hundreds of putative Iranian websites, which may potentially be under US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC) sanctions,"" the report said.

Google's vice president of global ads, Dan Taylor, said they will ensure they follow US sanctions and their own policies, but alluded to Adalytics' previous reports as having inaccuracies.

The report included various screenshots of advertisements close to problematic content, violating Google’s policies.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), BMW, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), KPMG, Walmart (NYSE: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ) were among the brands affected, while several alcohol brands had mismatched advertising and were placed on children's websites.

According to the report, not just brands but even politicians, including US Senators Ted Cruz and Amy Klobuchar, were located on the violating websites.

""It's the first time in history, we face the unsettling reality of AI committing crimes. Google's advertising algorithms demand scrutiny. The EU Commission must wield its audit powers to demand transparency and accountability about […] the PMax and other ad bidding algorithms,"" a member of the European Parliament (MEP) Paul Tang said.

2022-12-03, IANS,X may go bankrupt under Elon Musk if advertisers keep fleeing,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-go-bankrupt-under-elon-musk-if-advertisers-keep-fleeing-3922492,"London, Dec 3 (IANS) The loans Elon Musk took out to buy Twitter (now called X) was about $13 billion and the social media company has to pay about $1.2 billion in interest payments every year.

As big advertisers quit the platform and X cannot pay the interest on its loans or pay employees, then it could actually go bankrupt, the BBC reported on Sunday. “But that would be an extreme scenario that Musk would surely want to avoid,” the report mentioned.

However, for a company he bought for $44 billion, bankruptcy might sound unthinkable but “it is possible”. Disney and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are no longer advertising on X and Musk told companies last week to ""Go f*** yourself.”

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has confirmed that it is not advertising on X. ""We aren’t advertising on X as we’ve found other platforms to better reach our customers,"" a Walmart spokesperson was quoted as saying in reports.

The departure of Walmart adds to the growing list of firms leaving X after Musk endorsed an antisemitic post last month (for which, he apologised last week). Apple, Disney, IBM (NYSE: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ) and Warner Bros. Discovery are among the companies no longer buying ads on X.

Last year, around 90 per cent of X's revenue came from advertising. Not any more. Musk has warned that the loss of big advertisers would spell the end of X. ""If the company fails, it will fail because of an advertiser boycott. And that will be what bankrupts the company."" he said.

""What this advertising boycott is going to do is kill the company. And the whole world will know that those advertisers killed the company, and we will document it in great detail,"" Musk had told the audience at The New York Times' DealBook Summit.

In 2022, Twitter's advertising revenue was around $4 billion. Insider Intelligence estimates that this year, it will drop to $1.9 billion. After Musk’s outburst against big advertisers, X is reportedly aiming to tap small and medium businesses (SMBs) to offset the advertising loss from big companies.

A new report by The Financial Times has claimed X will now turn to SMBs to shore up revenue after Musk angered big brands by supporting antisemitic content.

“Small and medium businesses are a very significant engine that we have definitely underplayed for a long time,"" a company spokesperson was quoted as saying. “It was always part of the plan, now we will go even further with it,” the company added.

The news was first reported by The Elec.

The iPhone 15 Pro has a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera with 3x zoom, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max has an enhanced Telephoto system with 5x zoom.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max incorporates a folded glass structure beneath the lens, which Apple refers to as tetraprism technology. It reflects light four times over, allowing for a longer focal length of 120mm, the report mentioned.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has repeatedly stated that he expects the tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom to be included in both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year.

Meanwhile, Apple has released software updates for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS to address two zero-day security vulnerabilities.

According to the company, the bugs were actively deployed in the wild.

""Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited against versions of iOS before iOS 16.7.1,"" the company wrote about both flaws in its security reports.

Choosing the right cryptocurrency for transactions is crucial. While Tether TRC20 and Bitcoin are widely accepted, it’s important to be mindful of transaction fees and processing times. Evaluate alternative options based on your preferences and the dynamics of the market.

Research and Identify Profitable Gift Cards

Conduct thorough market research to identify currently sought-after gift cards. Popular options often include significant retailers, gaming platforms, and streaming services. This information is easily accessible and analyzable by clicking on the ‘Sold’ filter on the main page, providing quick results on top-selling products. Stay updated on trends to adapt your inventory accordingly.

Stay Informed About Cryptocurrency Market Trends

Stay updated on cryptocurrency trends, market fluctuations, and regulatory changes. Being informed empowers you to make sound decisions and adapt your reselling strategy to evolving market conditions. Evaluate the value trend of cryptocurrencies and consider whether it is more profitable to exchange gift cards for Bitcoin with a floating value or for a stablecoin like Tether TRC20. If there is a sharp drop in the value of cryptocurrencies in the market, it’s wise to cash out gift cards through stablecoins. Conversely, if the cryptocurrency is on the rise, your options may include Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum.

Implement Marketing Strategies

Effectively market your gift cards on BuySellVouchers and other platforms. Leverage social media, online forums, and cryptocurrency communities to reach potential buyers. Promoting your BuySellVouchers seller account in various communities and creating a solid online presence can significantly boost your sales. Additionally, consider buying advertising for your products within the BuySellVouchers platform to place them in top positions and increase visibility.

Withdrawing Funds and Conclusion

The money will be credited to your account immediately after the purchase. Withdrawal of funds to an external wallet is possible after 36 hours. For more information about withdrawals, refer to the “How it Works” section on the BuySellVouchers website.

Reselling gift cards for cryptocurrency on BuySellVouchers requires a combination of market insight, strategic planning, and customer-focused practices. By following these guidelines, you can navigate this dynamic landscape and build a successful reselling venture. Remember, adaptability and continuous learning are vital to thriving in the evolving world of crypto-based commerce."
2022-12-01, Investing.com,Apple and Paramount in talks to bundle their streaming services at a discount - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-paramount-in-talks-to-bundle-their-streaming-services-at-a-discount--wsj-432SI-3921345,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount Global (PARA) are reportedly in early discussions to bundle their streaming services at a discounted rate, the WSJ reported today.

The potential combination would involve Paramount+'s content and Apple TV+, offering a more cost-effective solution compared to subscribing to each service individually.

Entertainment giants are increasingly exploring such partnerships to enhance affordability and appeal amid competitive pressures. Rising subscription prices have led to heightened customer churn, prompting companies to seek ways to retain subscribers.

Bundling services reduces the likelihood of cancellations, providing a strategic approach to combatting the trend of viewers unsubscribing after completing specific content.

The report comes after NBCUniversal’s Peacock teamed up with the grocery-delivery service Instacart to offer Peacock with ads access to Instacart+ subscribers without additional charges."
2022-12-01, IANS,"Global smartwatch shipments up 9% in Q3, Fire-Boltt & Huawei hit new highs: Report",https://in.investing.com/news/global-smartwatch-shipments-up-9-in-q3-fireboltt--huawei-hit-new-highs-report-3921248,"New Delhi, Dec 1 (IANS) The global smartwatch shipments increased 9 per cent (year-on-year) in the third quarter (Q3) of 2022, a new report said on Friday.According to Counterpoint Research, the primary drivers of this growth were the sustained strong performance of the Indian market led by Fire-Boltt as well as Huawei’s remarkable rebound in China.

""Amid a global economic slowdown, most consumer device markets like smartphones are still experiencing stagnation compared to a year ago. In contrast, the smartwatch market has recorded year-on-year growth for two consecutive quarters in both premium and budget segments,"" said Research Analyst Woojin Son.

""Notably, High-level Operating System (HLOS) smartwatches, typically featuring higher specification and price, have grown largely driven by Huawei in Q3 2022 as the company posted its highest quarterly performance ever,"" he added.

According to the report, Apple (NASDAQ: ) delivered its best-ever Q3 performance, with a 7 per cent (year-on-year) increase in shipments.

Huawei recorded an impressive 56 per cent (year-on-year) increase in overall shipments for the quarter, with HLOS smartwatches seeing a remarkable 122 per cent surge. Fire-Boltt recovered its leadership position in India after recording its all-time highest quarterly shipments.

All three major Indian brands -- Fire-Boltt, Noise, and boAt -- are growing at a slower rate than before. However, this is seen as a sign of stabilisation rather than sluggishness, the report noted.

“Meanwhile, the Indian market, which has been powerfully leading the Basic smartwatch sector, maintained robust growth in the quarter. The country contributed to 35 per cent of total global shipments, securing its position as the leader in the global market for the third consecutive quarter,"" Son said.

Samsung (KS: ) experienced a 19 per cent (year-on-year) decline in shipments. However, the new products released in August exhibited only a 3 per cent drop compared to the previous ones, the report mentioned.

2022-12-01, Investing.com,UK High Court endorses CMA's right to investigate Apple,https://in.investing.com/news/uk-high-court-endorses-cmas-right-to-investigate-apple-93CH-3921230,"The UK High Court has reinstated the Competition and Markets Authority's (CMA) ability to continue its investigation into Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s market practices concerning mobile browsers and cloud gaming. This decision follows a series of legal challenges, with the most recent judgment by the UK Court of Appeal on Thursday, supporting the CMA's stance against Apple in a probe related to their market position.

The investigation, which originated in November 2022, faced a setback on March 10, 2022, when the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) sided with Apple, putting a temporary hold on the CMA's inquiry. However, the UK High Court later overturned this decision, affirming the CMA's authority to conduct multiple investigations if they serve the principal purpose of promoting competition and protecting consumers, as outlined in the Enterprise Act 2002.

The court's unanimous ruling, which included Lord Justice Green, Lord Justice Arnold, and the Chancellor, emphasized that there is no overarching principle limiting regulatory bodies to a single investigation into a company's market behavior. This principle supports the CMA's mandate to scrutinize potential anti-competitive practices within Apple’s operations.

The CMA's Chief Executive, Sarah Cardell, has welcomed the decision, signaling readiness to proceed with the inquiry after the legal process is completed. Apple has yet to comment on the judgment or indicate whether they will escalate the matter to the UK Supreme Court.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,"Amkor to build advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona; worked closely with Apple",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amkor-to-build-advanced-packaging-and-test-facility-in-peoria-arizona-worked-closely-with-apple-432SI-3919960,"Amkor (NASDAQ: ) Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMKR) announced its plan to build an advanced packaging and test facility in Peoria, Arizona. By the time of full project completion, Amkor projects to invest approximately $2 billion and employ approximately 2,000 people at the new facility.

Amkor is the only US-headquartered OSAT (outsourced semiconductor assembly and test) service provider with advanced packaging technology capability and high-volume manufacturing experience. Upon completion, this will be the largest outsourced advanced packaging facility in the US.

""Expansion of a US semiconductor supply chain is underway, and as the largest US-headquartered advanced packaging company, we are excited to lead the charge in bolstering America’s advanced packaging capabilities,"" said Giel Rutten, Amkor’s president and chief executive officer. “Semiconductor companies, foundries, and other supply chain partners understand the need to strategically broaden their geographic footprint. The announcement of our new advanced packaging and test facility in Arizona is a clear signal of our intent to help our customers ensure resilient supply chains and be a part of a strong American semiconductor ecosystem.”

In recent Congressional testimony, Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo highlighted advanced packaging as a major area of focus for the US government’s effort to rebuild American semiconductor manufacturing. The Commerce Department made clear that developing robust advanced manufacturing capacity and capability is a key priority and essential to the success of the CHIPS program.

Amkor has secured approximately 55 acres of land with intent to build a state-of-the-art manufacturing campus with more than 500,000 square feet of clean room space. The first phase of the manufacturing plant is targeted to be ready for production within the next two to three years. Amkor plans to provide high volume, leading-edge technologies for advanced packaging and testing of semiconductors to support critical markets such as high-performance computing, automotive, and communications.

Amkor worked closely with Apple (NASDAQ: ) on the strategic vision and initial manufacturing capability of the Peoria facility, which will package and test chips produced for Apple at the nearby TSMC fab. When the new facility opens, Apple will be its first and largest customer.

Amkor first established its presence in the Greater Phoenix area in 1984 and is excited to expand its footprint in the evolving Arizona semiconductor industry. The new manufacturing location will uniquely position Amkor among a strong ecosystem of front-end fabs, IDMs, and suppliers with current or expanding presence in the area, including TSMC, Intel, Applied Materials, ASML and others.

The project has garnered strong support from the City of Peoria, the Arizona Commerce Authority, and government authorities as it expands the evolving semiconductor ecosystem, provides high-tech jobs, and increases economic energy in the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area.

To ensure the success of a project of this magnitude in the United States, Amkor has applied for CHIPS funding. The CHIPS and Science Act was established to boost US competitiveness, innovation, and national security in the semiconductor industry. As part of the $52.7 billion program, the federal government will award $39 billion to US companies in competitive grants to manufacturers to finance construction, expansion, and modernization of facilities and equipment. These funds will be critical to Amkor’s project moving forward.

“Amkor’s $2 billion project—one of the largest microchip investments announced in Arizona since the passage of the CHIPS Act last year—will create good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and help protect our national security,” Arizona Senator Mark Kelly said. “As one of the first advanced packaging facilities in the US, this is a huge step forward to reducing dependence on other countries in the microchip supply chain. When negotiating the CHIPS and Science Act, one of my top priorities was making sure companies like Amkor had the support needed to develop a resilient supply chain in places like Arizona that are leading the way in bringing microchip manufacturing back to America.”

“Amkor’s announcement is a historic step forward for Arizona that will bolster America’s national security and build a more resilient supply chain, bring billions of dollars into our state, and create thousands of good-paying jobs for Arizona workers,” said Governor Katie Hobbs. “With this project, one of the most significant investments in advanced packaging in America, Arizona will solidify itself as a world leader in the semiconductor industry. I was glad to meet with the Arizona Commerce Authority and Amkor leadership in South Korea to discuss future investments in Arizona and am proud to have them as a partner. Together, we’ll continue to expand the semiconductor ecosystem and continue Arizona’s long history of leadership in the advanced manufacturing sector.”

“Amkor has been a strategic OSAT partner to TSMC for many years,” said Dr. CC Wei, Chief Executive Officer of TSMC. “TSMC applauds Amkor for investing in the future of the semiconductor industry with us in Arizona. We share Amkor’s excitement for its significant investment and the value this facility will bring to TSMC, our customers, and the ecosystem.”

""Apple is committed to help build a new era of advanced manufacturing, right here in the US,” said Jeff Williams, Apple chief operating officer. “Apple and Amkor have worked together for more than a decade packaging chips used extensively in all Apple products, and we are thrilled that this partnership will now deliver the largest OSAT advanced packaging facility in the United States.”

“This new US facility, in combination with our advanced facilities spanning Asia and Europe, further strengthens our broad geographic footprint, supporting global but also enabling regional supply chains,” added Rutten. “This investment will reinforce our leadership position in advanced packaging and test within the key markets we serve while solidifying our commitment to expanding US-based chip manufacturing.”"
2022-11-30, IANS,Apple unveils ‘Lost Voice’ film to showcase 2 new accessibility features,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-lost-voice-film-to-showcase-2-new-accessibility-features-3919915,"New Delhi, Nov 30 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday unveiled a heartwarming film titled ‘Lost Voice’ which puts the spotlight on two new accessibility features that were recently rolled out, ahead of International Day for People with Disabilities that falls on December 3.The features — Personal Voice and Live Speech — were rolled out with iOS 17 and illustrate how powerful they can be through a beautiful story.

Millions of people are at risk of losing their ability to speak due to a wide range of conditions such as muscular dystrophy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known internationally as motor neurone disease (MND).

“Personal Voice uses secure on-device machine learning to sample and recreate your own voice, which means if you ever subsequently lose the ability to speak, you can continue to communicate through your iPhone, iPad or Mac (using another new feature called Live Speech) — and still sound like you,” according to Apple.

The film tells the tale of a young girl and her pink, floppy-eared furry friend, as they search high and low for his missing voice, before revealing a uniquely personal moment between a father and a daughter. It is narrated entirely with Personal Voice, generated on iPhone.

The film was cast with a genuine user of Personal Voice to narrate and play the role of the father: Dr. Tristram Ingham.

Ingham is a physician, associate professor of epidemiology and a disability advocate from Wellington, New Zealand.

He has facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), which causes progressive muscle degeneration starting in the face, shoulders, and arms, and can ultimately lead to an inability to speak.

Personal Voice as a technology enables Ingham to preserve and continue to use his own voice well into the future.

For the shoot, Apple enlisted Oscar-winning director Taika Waititi.

Shot in Waititi’s native New Zealand, the production features the beautiful natural landscapes of the country — including black sand beaches and rolling dunes.

2022-11-30, IANS,Global smartphone shipments to hit lowest level in decade this year,https://in.investing.com/news/global-smartphone-shipments-to-hit-lowest-level-in-decade-this-year-3919853,"New Delhi, Nov 30 (IANS) Global smartphone shipments in 2022 are projected to decline 5 per cent (year-on-year) to reach 1.2 billion, the lowest level in almost a decade, a new report showed on Thursday. However, the shipments are expected to increase by 3 per cent YoY in the fourth quarter this year to reach 312 million units, according to Counterpoint Research.

North America (NAM) and Europe’s shipments are expected to remain stagnant. However, China and emerging markets such as the Middle East and Africa (MEA) and India have managed to break out from their declines and will recover to become the new drivers of growth in the smartphone market from Q4 2022 onwards.

""India, maintaining its momentum for premiumisation, is expected to become Apple’s new growth focus. Apple’s India shipments are predicted to grow 23 per cent YoY in 2024,” said Associate Director Liz Lee said.

“However, due to its underperformance against Huawei in China, Apple’s global market share will unavoidably decline slightly YoY in Q4 2022 and across 2024,” Lee added.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), the usual market leader in Q4 with its newly launched series, is expected to record a volume decline of 3 per cent YoY in Q4 2022, mainly due to Huawei’s aggressive expansion in China and prolonged delay in smartphone upgrades in Japan.

However, Apple will try to offset the underperformance in volume terms by growing in value terms with a better product mix.

After destocking efforts end with a relatively healthy inventory by the year-end, smartphone shipments in 2024 are projected to grow by 3 per cent YoY, said the report.

""We can also expect a recovery focused on emerging markets, backed by increasing consumer confidence and improving macroeconomic conditions,"" it added.

Huawei, driven by its newly launched Mate 60 5G series and older P-series 4G devices, recorded an enormous success in Q3 2022.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,Apple extends Qualcomm contract to 2026 amid modem development hurdles,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-extends-qualcomm-contract-to-2026-amid-modem-development-hurdles-93CH-3918820,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has decided to extend its contract with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for key technology components until 2026, signaling a wind down in its plans to produce its own modems for iPhones and certain iPads. Despite acquiring Intel (NASDAQ: )'s modem division in 2019 for $1 billion under CEO Tim Cook's direction, Apple has faced persistent challenges in software and hardware development that have hindered its progress.

The tech giant's endeavors to enhance modem speed began in 2018 but have yet to yield the anticipated breakthroughs, prompting a reduction in investment. This development contrasts with Apple's successful in-house production shift, notably the transition to Apple Silicon, which has significantly benefitted its product lineup, including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

This strategic pivot underscores the difficulties Apple has encountered in its quest for production autonomy. The reliance on Qualcomm as a supplier for crucial components is expected to continue, as the setbacks in Apple's own modem project suggest that the company is not yet ready to sever ties with its long-standing partner. The news, shared by industry insiders yeux1122 and @Tech_Reve on X (formerly Twitter), indicates a notable shift from Apple's usual approach of internalizing production to maintain control over its technology ecosystem.

InvestingPro Insights

As Apple Inc. renews its partnership with Qualcomm Inc ., it's worth noting the financial health and market performance of both companies to understand the broader context of this decision. According to InvestingPro data, Apple is currently trading at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 30.7, suggesting a strong investor confidence in its earnings potential despite a slight revenue decline of -2.8% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2022. This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip highlighting Apple's high earnings quality, as its free cash flow continues to exceed net income, indicating robust financial health.

On the other hand, Qualcomm, a prominent player in the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry, has a P/E ratio of 19.78, reflecting a more moderate valuation by the market. Notably, Qualcomm exhibits a strong return on assets at 14.46%, supporting an InvestingPro Tip that recognizes the company's high return on invested capital.

Speaking at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, when Andrew Ross Sorkin asked the X owner about pauses in advertising, Musk replied, ""Don't advertise.""

""You don't want them to advertise?"" Sorkin asked him.

""If somebody's going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money? Go f*** yourself,"" Musk said.

He then waved to the audience, saying, ""Hey Bob,"" referring to Disney CEO Bob Iger who was also present at the event.

Musk, in his first interview with mainstream media since his anti-Semitic post, however apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" ever social media post on Semitism.

""I mean, look, I'm sorry for that post. It was foolish of me. Of the 30,000 it might be literally the worst and dumbest post I've ever done,"" he said.

Market Performance and Product Segments

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the renowned technology behemoth, continues to dominate headlines and investor analyses, with its diverse product lineup and strategic market positioning garnering attention. As the company maneuvers through the competitive landscape, its performance in different markets and detailed breakdown of product segments remain critical for potential investors.

Analysts have scrutinized Apple's inventory levels, noting a seasonal increase in line with expectations. However, some caution is warranted as inventory days are significantly higher than the median, potentially indicating overstocking or a slowdown in demand. Despite these concerns, Apple's resilience is evident in its ability to navigate supply constraints and competitive pressures, especially in the high-end smartphone segment in China.

Apple's average selling price (ASP) in China stands out, significantly higher than its competitors, which allows the company to capture a substantial market revenue share despite a lower unit share. The company's focus on premium devices with higher ASPs has been a strategic move to sustain revenue, supported by a loyal customer base and less price sensitivity among high-end buyers.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

In the competitive landscape, Apple has shown remarkable resilience, particularly in China, where it remains the dominant player in high-end smartphones. Despite the competition from Huawei, Apple's market share increased to 39% in 2022, while Huawei's market share was affected by the US ban. Analysts believe that concerns around competition from Huawei are overstated and maintain a positive outlook on Apple's premium market positioning.

However, the potential for market share loss exists if competitors like Huawei continue to grow aggressively. Supply constraints could also limit sales performance and affect short-term revenue. The risk from Huawei is considered overstated by some analysts, who believe that Apple's decline in unit sales is more likely due to supply constraints rather than a loss of market share.

Looking ahead, Apple is gearing up for upcoming product launches, including the much-anticipated iPhone 15. The company's strategy of maximizing gross profit per unit through a migration to premium phones and related services, rather than volume, is expected to continue driving its financial success.

Regulatory Environments and External Factors

Regulatory challenges pose potential risks to Apple's revenue model, especially concerning the App Store. Economic slowdowns, particularly in China, could impact sales, and potential tariffs affecting imports could increase costs or affect supply chains. The ongoing Google (NASDAQ: ) anti-trust trial poses potential headline risks for Apple due to its default search engine deal with Google, estimated at around $12B in payments to Apple.

Management and Strategy

Under Tim Cook's leadership, Apple has successfully navigated US-China geopolitics, maintaining a strong brand image and customer loyalty within its ecosystem. The company's management strategy focuses on sustaining its market position through innovation, service growth, and strategic financial management.

Analyst Outlooks and Projections

Analysts maintain a range of views on Apple's stock, with price targets reflecting the company's growth prospects, quality of earnings, competitive moat, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Despite some near-term headwinds, the consensus remains positive, with expectations of revenue growth and a modest re-rating of shares.

Bear Case

Can Apple withstand the competitive pressure from Huawei?

The bear case for Apple centers on the potential market share loss to Huawei, which has re-entered the high-end smartphone market with technologically advanced offerings. While Apple's ecosystem stickiness and brand aspiration are significant factors in retaining customers, the worst-case scenario of market share loss to Huawei could result in a single-digit percentage impact on Apple's revenue and earnings.

Will Apple's investment in A.I. affect profitability?

Another emerging bear case revolves around Apple's investment in Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). With the technology sector's rapid advancements in A.I., Apple's capital expenditures in this area are seen as bearish due to the potential negative impact on free cash flow (FCF). Analysts express concerns over the increased competition and pricing pressures, as well as the necessity to ramp up the software/services business successfully.

Bull Case

How will new product launches impact Apple's revenue growth?

The bull case for Apple is buoyed by the anticipated success of the iPhone 15 upgrade cycle and the launch of new products equipped with the M3 chip family. Supply chain checks suggest initial iPhone units could be around 85 million, potentially reaching 90 million due to carrier promotions. The iPhone Pro Max's price remaining unchanged is expected to drive an additional 8 to 10 million units globally during this launch cycle.

Can Apple's services segment sustain double-digit growth?

Additionally, the tech giant displayed search ads not only on its own platform but also on third-party websites within the ""Google Search Partner network"", including YouTube.

The report further found that the company was showing ads on websites alongside explicit and pirated content and that ads, for instance, for the US Secret Service, FBI, and the US Treasury, were found on a Russian and an Iranian-sanctioned website.

""These included websites such as Breitbart.com, sites containing pirated content, hardcore pornographic sites, and hundreds of putative Iranian websites, which may potentially be under US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC) sanctions,"" the report said.

Google's vice president of global ads, Dan Taylor, said they will ensure they follow US sanctions and their own policies, but alluded to Adalytics' previous reports as having inaccuracies.

2022-11-29, Investing.com,Apple to End Credit Card Partnership with Goldman Sachs Within 15 Months,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-end-credit-card-partnership-with-goldman-sachs-within-15-months-93CH-3917040,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is set to end its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: )., aiming to wrap up their agreement within the next 12 to 15 months. This decision marks a significant shift for the tech giant, which had previously joined forces with Goldman Sachs to offer a credit card in 2019 and a savings account in 2022. The Wall Street Journal, citing inside sources, reported that Goldman Sachs' foray into consumer lending brought about unexpected costs that have led to a strategic reevaluation.

The termination of this partnership will put an end to the products that emerged from the collaboration, including the Apple-branded credit card. Despite the planned exit, Apple has not yet disclosed any details about a new issuer to take over the financial services provided by Goldman Sachs. The move comes after Goldman Sachs experienced significant errors due to the rapid expansion into consumer lending. These errors prompted the bank to consider exiting credit partnerships and to discuss potential handovers with other financial institutions.

American Express Co (NYSE: ). and Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ) were among the companies approached by Goldman Sachs. American Express showed concern about potential loss rates, and while Synchrony Financial appeared interested in taking over the Apple card program, neither company has provided a public response to the inquiries about their involvement.

Goldman Sachs has not offered any comments regarding these developments, and Apple has remained silent on inquiries for input on their future plans. The news of this strategic shift comes at a time when Apple continues to explore the expansion of its services segment, which includes a variety of digital offerings beyond hardware products. The outcome of these discussions and the future of Apple's financial products remain to be seen as the market anticipates the tech giant's next move.

The company, however, did not provide further details.

Foxconn is the main assembler of Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones and both companies are keen to move away from China and create alternative supply chains.

Foxconn already has an iPhone factory in Tamil Nadu (NS: ), which employs 40,000 people and has signed an agreement to invest Rs 1,600 crore in a new electronics components unit in the state that will create 6,000 jobs.

In the fast-paced world of technology and semiconductors, Qualcomm Inc . (NASDAQ: ) has been drawing considerable attention on Wall Street due to its strategic maneuvers and partnerships. The company, a heavyweight in wireless technology and a key player in the smartphone segment, has recently secured a series of deals that have analysts buzzing about its future prospects.

Company Profile and Strategic Agreements

Qualcomm's profile has been bolstered by a multi-year agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems for upcoming iPhone launches slated for 2024, 2025, and 2026. This extension of the supply agreement to FY27 is a strategic win for Qualcomm, ensuring its presence in the iPhone ecosystem and providing a bridge to a more diversified revenue profile. This move is expected to underpin sustainable earnings of at least $10 through FY27, with the potential for $12 earnings power assuming normalization in the Android handset business.

Financial Health and Stock Performance

The company's financial health appears robust, with annual cash flow projected to remain sustainable in the $8-10 billion range. This could translate into significant free cash flow and EPS accretion if deployed effectively through stock buybacks or substantial cash acquisitions. Despite a year-to-date increase of 4% and a decline over the last twelve months by 11%, Qualcomm's stock has been trading at 12.1x FY24 EPS of $9.35, which falls below its approximate 5-year average P/E of ~14.0x.

Market Trends and Competitive Landscape

The handset market, according to analysts, is nearing a cyclical trough after more than a year of inventory correction. Qualcomm's strategic agreements and diversification into automotive and other sectors position it favorably against competitors like GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: ), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: ), and Qorvo (NASDAQ: ). Moreover, Qualcomm's long-term optionality in sectors such as auto and PC is seen as a distinct advantage.

Regulatory Environment and External Factors

Qualcomm's reliance on third-party foundries is a noted risk, especially in a geopolitical landscape where supply chain disruptions and increased competition can pose significant challenges. Moreover, the ongoing development of Apple's internal modem could eventually impact Qualcomm's business with AAPL. However, the complexity of modem development, particularly with evolving 5G standards, has thus far worked in Qualcomm's favor.

Analysts Targets

Analysts have set a range of price targets and ratings for Qualcomm, reflecting the company's strong positioning and potential risks. Here are the most recent targets and ratings:

Wolfe Research: Outperform with a price target of $145 (as of September 18, 2022).

Barclays (LON: ) Capital Inc.: Overweight with a price target of $140 (as of September 12, 2022).

(LON: ) Capital Inc.: Overweight with a price target of $140 (as of September 12, 2022). Rosenblatt Securities Inc.: 12-month target price of $145 (as of September 11, 2022).

Evercore ISI: In Line with a price target of $140 (as of September 11, 2022).

Deutsche Bank (ETR: ) Securities Inc.: Hold with a price target of $120 (as of September 11, 2022).

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Secured long-term modem supply agreement with Apple.

Diversification into automotive and PC sectors.

Technological leadership in the development of 5G Modem-RF Systems.

Weaknesses:

Reliance (NS: ) on third-party foundries for production.

Potential market share loss to Apple in the Android handset business.

Risks associated with Apple's internal modem development efforts.

Opportunities:

Potential reacceleration of EPS with the next cyclical upturn in handsets and IoT.

Expansion of the total addressable market with new product launches.

Rising demand for 5G technology and related infrastructure.

Threats:

Slower than expected adoption of 5G smartphones.

Increased competition affecting pricing and profitability.

Economic downturns impacting consumer and corporate spending.

The timeframe for this analysis spans from September to October 2022.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

“We don’t need heavy regulation here or probably for the next couple generations. But at some point, when a model can do the equivalent output of a whole company, or a whole country, or a whole world, maybe we do want some collective supervision around that,” he said on a panel at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco.

However, the OpenAI fiasco has once again triggered the call to regulate AI in such a way that such episodes are not repeated.

France, Germany and Italy have reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated.

However, businesses and tech groups have cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models in upcoming AI rules.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI),” DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Ericsson (BS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

In India, concerns over deepfakes have put the government in motion to warn social media platforms to remove altered audio/video from their respective platforms or face action.

The government on Friday gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent against such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

""They are further mandated to remove such content within 24 hours upon receiving a report from either a user or government authority. Failure to comply with this requirement invokes Rule 7, which empowers aggrieved individuals to take platforms to court under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"" the minister said.

""For those who find themselves impacted by deepfakes, I strongly encourage you to file FIRs at your nearest police station,"" said Chandrasekhar, adding that the IT Ministry will help aggrieved users in filing FIRs in relation to deepfakes.

India is mulling regulation to tame the spread of deepfakes and other user harms that AI can bring along, said Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

After meeting representatives from large social media platforms and other stakeholders, the minister said India will draft new rules to spot and limit the spread of deepfakes. The new regulation will also strengthen the reporting process for such deepfake videos.

After the successful AI Safety Summit in the UK, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in Delhi next month will further deliberate upon the risks associated with AI -- in the presence of world leaders -- before a global framework is reached in Korea next year.

2022-11-25, IANS,X may lose up to $75 mn of ad revenue as more brands pull out: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-lose-up-to-75-mn-of-ad-revenue-as-more-brands-pull-out-report-3913270,"San Francisco, Nov 25 (IANS) Elon Musk-run X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pull out their marketing campaigns after the tech billionaire endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month, the media reported.According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Musk's support for an antisemitic message on the platform last week prompted numerous firms, including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery, to halt advertising on the X.

X has responded by suing non-profit Media Matters, arguing that the organisation defamed the platform with a report alleging that advertisements for major brands such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ) appeared next to messages praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

According to the report, the documents come from X's sales team and are designed to monitor the effects of all the advertising mishaps that took place this month, including those by companies that have already suspended ads and others that may be at risk of doing so.

The documents detail how much ad revenue X employees worry the company could lose by the end of the year if advertisers do not resume their ads.

However, X claimed in a statement on Friday that $11 million in revenue was at risk, with the actual sum fluctuating as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, a new report has revealed that some super-spreaders of misinformation on X, who are verified premium users with blue badges, are sharing Musk’s ad revenue even after making conspiratorial claims about the Israel-Hamas war.

NewsGuard, a for-profit misinformation watchdog organisation, found that such posts with misinformation reached a collective 92 million views.

The analysts, who have an Outperform rating and $240 price target on the stock, said their firm's recent Asia supply chain checks ""remain very firm for Apple's iPhone 15 into an important holiday season with particular strength in the China region"" despite the negative bear noise a few months ago.

They added that they have not seen any major negative revisions around iPhone units coming out of Asia into the holiday season/early 2024, which speaks to what they ""believe is a very consistent consumer demand environment around iPhone 15 so far, which is good news for Cook & Co.""

The firm also noted that the ""US has been a clear bright spot for Apple since the iPhone 15 launch,"" and they ""believe the key stretch from Black Friday into Christmas will be up modestly from iPhone 14 despite fears of being a disappointment from the bears coming out of the September timeframe.

This success can be attributed to its concentrated investment approach, with nearly three-quarters of its $357 billion portfolio invested in just four cornerstone companies: Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), American Express (NYSE: ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ).

Apple stands as Berkshire's crown jewel, commanding a staggering $173.7 billion stake, which is 48.6% of the entire portfolio. The tech giant's nearly 90% iPhone loyalty rate and diversification into subscription services have been pivotal in its performance. Additionally, an aggressive repurchase program with over $600 billion in buybacks since 2013 has further cemented Apple's position as a valuable asset for Berkshire.

Bank of America is another significant holding, valued at $31 billion or 8.7% of the portfolio. The bank benefits from the Federal Reserve's rate hikes due to its sensitivity to interest rates. It has also streamlined costs and improved efficiency through technological advancements in banking services.

The portfolio's exposure to the financial sector is further strengthened by a $24.6 billion stake in American Express, which represents 6.9%. The company attracts affluent customers less impacted by economic downturns and generates substantial returns from both transaction processing and credit lending.

Coca-Cola adds to Berkshire's strategic allocation with a $22.9 billion investment, accounting for 6.4% of the total portfolio. The beverage company offers stable cash flow and consistent demand as a consumer staple with an extensive history of dividend increases. Its products are purchased nearly six billion times annually worldwide, with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia due to current conflicts.

In addition to these stock holdings, Berkshire fully owns assets like the BNSF railway system and GEICO insurance, which complement its stock investments and showcase Buffett and Munger's robust investment strategy characterized by high-conviction bets within an expansive portfolio.

Buffett's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term growth and shareholder value through focused asset allocation in high-performing companies with strong market positions—a strategy that continues to yield impressive results for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

The Wall Street Journal, citing inside sources, reported that Goldman Sachs' foray into consumer lending brought about unexpected costs that have led to a strategic reevaluation.

The termination of this partnership will put an end to the products that emerged from the collaboration, including the Apple-branded credit card. Despite the planned exit, Apple has not yet disclosed any details about a new issuer to take over the financial services provided by Goldman Sachs. The move comes after Goldman Sachs experienced significant errors due to the rapid expansion into consumer lending. These errors prompted the bank to consider exiting credit partnerships and to discuss potential handovers with other financial institutions.

American Express Co (NYSE: ). and Synchrony Financial (NYSE: ) were among the companies approached by Goldman Sachs. American Express showed concern about potential loss rates, and while Synchrony Financial appeared interested in taking over the Apple card program, neither company has provided a public response to the inquiries about their involvement.

Goldman Sachs has not offered any comments regarding these developments, and Apple has remained silent on inquiries for input on their future plans. The news of this strategic shift comes at a time when Apple continues to explore the expansion of its services segment, which includes a variety of digital offerings beyond hardware products. The outcome of these discussions and the future of Apple's financial products remain to be seen as the market anticipates the tech giant's next move.

In the fast-paced world of technology and semiconductors, Qualcomm Inc . (NASDAQ: ) has been drawing considerable attention on Wall Street due to its strategic maneuvers and partnerships. The company, a heavyweight in wireless technology and a key player in the smartphone segment, has recently secured a series of deals that have analysts buzzing about its future prospects.

Company Profile and Strategic Agreements

Qualcomm's profile has been bolstered by a multi-year agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) to supply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF Systems for upcoming iPhone launches slated for 2024, 2025, and 2026. This extension of the supply agreement to FY27 is a strategic win for Qualcomm, ensuring its presence in the iPhone ecosystem and providing a bridge to a more diversified revenue profile. This move is expected to underpin sustainable earnings of at least $10 through FY27, with the potential for $12 earnings power assuming normalization in the Android handset business.

Financial Health and Stock Performance

The company's financial health appears robust, with annual cash flow projected to remain sustainable in the $8-10 billion range. This could translate into significant free cash flow and EPS accretion if deployed effectively through stock buybacks or substantial cash acquisitions. Despite a year-to-date increase of 4% and a decline over the last twelve months by 11%, Qualcomm's stock has been trading at 12.1x FY24 EPS of $9.35, which falls below its approximate 5-year average P/E of ~14.0x.

Market Trends and Competitive Landscape

The handset market, according to analysts, is nearing a cyclical trough after more than a year of inventory correction. Qualcomm's strategic agreements and diversification into automotive and other sectors position it favorably against competitors like GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: ), Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: ), and Qorvo (NASDAQ: ). Moreover, Qualcomm's long-term optionality in sectors such as auto and PC is seen as a distinct advantage.

Regulatory Environment and External Factors

Qualcomm's reliance on third-party foundries is a noted risk, especially in a geopolitical landscape where supply chain disruptions and increased competition can pose significant challenges. Moreover, the ongoing development of Apple's internal modem could eventually impact Qualcomm's business with AAPL. However, the complexity of modem development, particularly with evolving 5G standards, has thus far worked in Qualcomm's favor.

Analysts Targets

Analysts have set a range of price targets and ratings for Qualcomm, reflecting the company's strong positioning and potential risks. Here are the most recent targets and ratings:

Wolfe Research: Outperform with a price target of $145 (as of September 18, 2022).

Barclays (LON: ) Capital Inc.: Overweight with a price target of $140 (as of September 12, 2022).

(LON: ) Capital Inc.: Overweight with a price target of $140 (as of September 12, 2022). Rosenblatt Securities Inc.: 12-month target price of $145 (as of September 11, 2022).

Evercore ISI: In Line with a price target of $140 (as of September 11, 2022).

Deutsche Bank (ETR: ) Securities Inc.: Hold with a price target of $120 (as of September 11, 2022).

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Secured long-term modem supply agreement with Apple.

Diversification into automotive and PC sectors.

Technological leadership in the development of 5G Modem-RF Systems.

Weaknesses:

Reliance (NS: ) on third-party foundries for production.

Potential market share loss to Apple in the Android handset business.

Risks associated with Apple's internal modem development efforts.

Opportunities:

Potential reacceleration of EPS with the next cyclical upturn in handsets and IoT.

Expansion of the total addressable market with new product launches.

Rising demand for 5G technology and related infrastructure.

Threats:

Slower than expected adoption of 5G smartphones.

Increased competition affecting pricing and profitability.

Economic downturns impacting consumer and corporate spending.

The timeframe for this analysis spans from September to October 2022.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

“We don’t need heavy regulation here or probably for the next couple generations. But at some point, when a model can do the equivalent output of a whole company, or a whole country, or a whole world, maybe we do want some collective supervision around that,” he said on a panel at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco.

However, the OpenAI fiasco has once again triggered the call to regulate AI in such a way that such episodes are not repeated.

France, Germany and Italy have reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated.

However, businesses and tech groups have cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models in upcoming AI rules.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI),” DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Ericsson (BS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

In India, concerns over deepfakes have put the government in motion to warn social media platforms to remove altered audio/video from their respective platforms or face action.

The government on Friday gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent against such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

""They are further mandated to remove such content within 24 hours upon receiving a report from either a user or government authority. Failure to comply with this requirement invokes Rule 7, which empowers aggrieved individuals to take platforms to court under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"" the minister said.

""For those who find themselves impacted by deepfakes, I strongly encourage you to file FIRs at your nearest police station,"" said Chandrasekhar, adding that the IT Ministry will help aggrieved users in filing FIRs in relation to deepfakes.

India is mulling regulation to tame the spread of deepfakes and other user harms that AI can bring along, said Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

After meeting representatives from large social media platforms and other stakeholders, the minister said India will draft new rules to spot and limit the spread of deepfakes. The new regulation will also strengthen the reporting process for such deepfake videos.

After the successful AI Safety Summit in the UK, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in Delhi next month will further deliberate upon the risks associated with AI -- in the presence of world leaders -- before a global framework is reached in Korea next year.

2022-11-25, IANS,X may lose up to $75 mn of ad revenue as more brands pull out: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-lose-up-to-75-mn-of-ad-revenue-as-more-brands-pull-out-report-3913270,"San Francisco, Nov 25 (IANS) Elon Musk-run X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pull out their marketing campaigns after the tech billionaire endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month, the media reported.According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Musk's support for an antisemitic message on the platform last week prompted numerous firms, including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery, to halt advertising on the X.

X has responded by suing non-profit Media Matters, arguing that the organisation defamed the platform with a report alleging that advertisements for major brands such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ) appeared next to messages praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

According to the report, the documents come from X's sales team and are designed to monitor the effects of all the advertising mishaps that took place this month, including those by companies that have already suspended ads and others that may be at risk of doing so.

The documents detail how much ad revenue X employees worry the company could lose by the end of the year if advertisers do not resume their ads.

However, X claimed in a statement on Friday that $11 million in revenue was at risk, with the actual sum fluctuating as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, a new report has revealed that some super-spreaders of misinformation on X, who are verified premium users with blue badges, are sharing Musk’s ad revenue even after making conspiratorial claims about the Israel-Hamas war.

NewsGuard, a for-profit misinformation watchdog organisation, found that such posts with misinformation reached a collective 92 million views.

The analysts, who have an Outperform rating and $240 price target on the stock, said their firm's recent Asia supply chain checks ""remain very firm for Apple's iPhone 15 into an important holiday season with particular strength in the China region"" despite the negative bear noise a few months ago.

They added that they have not seen any major negative revisions around iPhone units coming out of Asia into the holiday season/early 2024, which speaks to what they ""believe is a very consistent consumer demand environment around iPhone 15 so far, which is good news for Cook & Co.""

The firm also noted that the ""US has been a clear bright spot for Apple since the iPhone 15 launch,"" and they ""believe the key stretch from Black Friday into Christmas will be up modestly from iPhone 14 despite fears of being a disappointment from the bears coming out of the September timeframe.

This success can be attributed to its concentrated investment approach, with nearly three-quarters of its $357 billion portfolio invested in just four cornerstone companies: Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), American Express (NYSE: ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ).

Apple stands as Berkshire's crown jewel, commanding a staggering $173.7 billion stake, which is 48.6% of the entire portfolio. The tech giant's nearly 90% iPhone loyalty rate and diversification into subscription services have been pivotal in its performance. Additionally, an aggressive repurchase program with over $600 billion in buybacks since 2013 has further cemented Apple's position as a valuable asset for Berkshire.

Bank of America is another significant holding, valued at $31 billion or 8.7% of the portfolio. The bank benefits from the Federal Reserve's rate hikes due to its sensitivity to interest rates. It has also streamlined costs and improved efficiency through technological advancements in banking services.

The portfolio's exposure to the financial sector is further strengthened by a $24.6 billion stake in American Express, which represents 6.9%. The company attracts affluent customers less impacted by economic downturns and generates substantial returns from both transaction processing and credit lending.

Coca-Cola adds to Berkshire's strategic allocation with a $22.9 billion investment, accounting for 6.4% of the total portfolio. The beverage company offers stable cash flow and consistent demand as a consumer staple with an extensive history of dividend increases. Its products are purchased nearly six billion times annually worldwide, with the exception of North Korea, Cuba, and Russia due to current conflicts.

In addition to these stock holdings, Berkshire fully owns assets like the BNSF railway system and GEICO insurance, which complement its stock investments and showcase Buffett and Munger's robust investment strategy characterized by high-conviction bets within an expansive portfolio.

Buffett's investment philosophy emphasizes long-term growth and shareholder value through focused asset allocation in high-performing companies with strong market positions—a strategy that continues to yield impressive results for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders.

Detecting such attacks relies on threat intelligence signals that are often imperfect and incomplete. It's possible that some Apple threat notifications may be false alarms, or that some attacks are not detected,"" the tech giant had said in a statement.

Apple had said it was “unable to provide information about what causes us to issue threat notifications, as that may help state-sponsored attackers adapt their behaviour to evade detection in the future”.

The company launched its end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service on Windows in July.

Proton Drive is free for 1GB of data, with plans starting at $4.99 per month for 200GB.

“Whether you use Mac or Windows, or iPhone or Android, Proton does not tie you to any specific hardware or operating system, and if you use Proton Drive, you can seamlessly move from one platform to another without losing functionality,” the company said in a blog post.

The app lets you easily sync files between your Mac and the cloud, access them offline, and free up space on your computer — all with end-to-end encryption and privacy by default.

Unlike iCloud, which does not offer end-to-end encryption by default for files and folders, Proton Drive uses end-to-end encryption for all data across all devices.

“File encryption happens automatically on your device before uploading to the cloud. That means nobody — not even Proton — can see your files’ contents. End-to-end encryption is also used for all metadata, such as file names and modified date,” Proton Drive informed.

“The Proton Drive macOS app makes file syncing and access a seamless experience. When you enable sync, all the files in your Proton Drive account sync directly to your Mac,” it added.

Files and folders you save in the Proton Drive folder automatically sync online to Proton Drive, and any changes you make on your Mac are mirrored across all your other devices.

Additionally, Proton Drive for macOS stores edits as new versions of the file.

2022-11-23, Investing.com,Morgan Stanley sees Edge AI as next big investment trend,https://in.investing.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-edge-ai-as-next-big-investment-trend-93CH-3911332,"Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) has identified Edge AI technology as a pivotal element in the evolution of real-time data processing on devices like smartphones and smart speakers. The financial institution highlighted the importance of this technology in enabling advanced features such as facial recognition, while also tackling latency issues that are critical for user experience.

Edge AI refers to artificial intelligence algorithms that are processed locally on a hardware device, rather than relying on cloud servers. This approach can significantly reduce response times and bandwidth usage, making it an attractive proposition for both consumers and businesses.

The surge in demand for Generative AI applications has been recognized as a driving force for investment opportunities, particularly during what Morgan Stanley sees as a rebounding hardware cycle. Generative AI, which includes technologies capable of creating new content like images or text based on learned data, requires robust processing capabilities that Edge AI can provide.

Several companies are poised to lead this charge, according to Morgan Stanley's analysis. Apple (NASDAQ: ) has been assigned a $210 price target due to its energy-efficient silicon that is expected to enhance Edge AI applications across its range of devices. Dell (NYSE: ) is preparing for a wave of AI-equipped PCs and has been given an $89 price goal in anticipation of increased demand.

Other companies set to capitalize on this trend include MediaTek, with its focus on system-on-a-chip designs tailored for Edge AI, which has a targeted value of 1,000 New Taiwan dollars. Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) is enhancing Edge AI capabilities through its Snapdragon line and holds a valuation estimate of $119.

STMicroelectronics is optimizing local computing power for automotive applications among others, with a predicted worth of 48 euros. Lastly, Xiaomi (OTC: ) is at the forefront of integrating Edge AI into smartphones and carries a projected price point of 15 Hong Kong dollars.

The focus on decentralized workloads to user devices at the network's edge is seen as a way to cut costs and minimize latency, extending the reach of AI into consumer and enterprise realms. This shift towards localized processing power marks a significant step in the evolution of the technology landscape, with potential benefits across multiple industries.

2022-11-23, Investing.com,Apple iPhone sales dip amid Huawei and Xiaomi gains in China,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-iphone-sales-dip-amid-huawei-and-xiaomi-gains-in-china-93CH-3911228,"China’s smartphone market has witnessed a notable shift in sales dynamics, with Apple (NASDAQ: ) experiencing a 4% year-over-year decline in smartphone sales during the recent Singles Day event period. This comes despite JD (NASDAQ: ).com’s report of high transaction volumes exceeding 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion) for Apple products. The dip contrasts sharply with Huawei’s impressive 66% and Xiaomi’s 28% surge in sales, contributing to an overall 5% boost in the Chinese smartphone sector.

The pricing strategy reveals a competitive landscape, with the iPhone 15 tagged at 5,999 yuan ($832), Huawei’s Mate 60 at 5,499 yuan, and Xiaomi’s Mi 14 at a more modest 3,999 yuan. These price points were critical during the Singles Day shopping spree, which is known for its substantial discounts and has become a significant event for consumer electronics sales in China.

Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series, released late September, faced tough competition as Xiaomi (OTC: ) unveiled its Mi 14 line in late October, swiftly surpassing one million units sold after its debut. Huawei also made headlines earlier with its Mate 60 range launch, gaining nationalistic support for its advanced chip that bypasses U.S. sanctions.

Despite the challenges, industry analysts from IDC suggest a recovery is on the horizon for China's smartphone market after enduring persistent shipment drops. However, Counterpoint Research attributes part of Apple's recent stagnation to supply chain issues that have affected the availability of the latest iPhone models. These disruptions are anticipated to stabilize soon, potentially aiding Apple to regain momentum following this high-volume sales event.

The information comes from an integrated circuit expert on Weibo who has a track record of revealing information regarding Apple's plans.

In a recent post, they explained that the equipment used to manufacture chips for the iPhone's version of Touch ID has been permanently shut down, with the only remaining units used for the third-generation iPhone SE.

This suggests that Apple isn't planning to bring back Touch ID as a method of authentication on the iPhone anytime soon, reports MacRumors.

The report also noted that there are no credible rumours concerning the return of Apple's fingerprint-scanning technology for the iPhone 16 series.

According to reports, the fourth-generation iPhone SE will include Face ID, replacing the only iPhone model that still uses Touch ID.

Meanwhile, Apple has announced it will support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in 2024. In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

""Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,"" an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway divests from long-held stocks amid market shifts,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-divests-from-longheld-stocks-amid-market-shifts-93CH-3910431,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has made significant changes to its investment portfolio, according to recent SEC filings. The company has completely divested from several long-standing holdings, including General Motors (NYSE:NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE:NYSE: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE: ), amid various economic pressures and strategic shifts.

The move comes as Berkshire's Class A shares have seen a near 4,400,000% gain since Buffett took the helm in the mid-1960s. Investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been active in reshaping the portfolio during the third quarter. The exit from General Motors, held since the first quarter of 2012, was likely influenced by increased labor costs following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union and a downturn in electric vehicle demand as loan rates rise.

Similarly, UPS, part of Berkshire's portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, saw its remaining shares sold due to economic uncertainties and higher labor expenses stemming from new labor contracts. Mondelez International, with popular brands like Oreo and Ritz under its belt since the second quarter of 2007, was dropped amidst consumer resistance to price hikes and concerns over a heavy debt load that echoed issues seen during Kraft Heinz’s writedown incident.

Procter & Gamble, a Berkshire holding since the first quarter of 2005, was released as it faced volume declines and currency headwinds. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson, a staple in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, was sold off due to litigation issues related to talc cancer claims and Buffett’s preference not to closely track drug development catalysts—despite JNJ's strong value proposition indicated by its rare AAA credit rating.

Despite these sell-offs, Apple (NASDAQ: ) remains Berkshire's dominant position even though it experienced a valuation dip. Reduced positions were also noted in other companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), HP Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ), Aon (NYSE:NYSE: ), Markel (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Globe Life (NYSE:NYSE: ).

In contrast to these divestments, Berkshire Hathaway has made new investments including an $8 million interest in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and expanded holdings in Liberty Media with stakes in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Liberty Live Group. In addition to these acquisitions, Berkshire invested a fresh $44 million in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: ). To maintain competitive secrecy, Berkshire has sought confidential treatment for an undisclosed new holding.

With these portfolio adjustments reflecting Buffett's strategic thinking amid current market dynamics, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have soared to a record $157 billion. This substantial cash pile underscores the conglomerate's ability to capitalize on investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns.

The Shenzhen-based company, supported by the local government and BOE Technology Group Co., is realigning its governance structure to meet listing regulations.

Today, Honor announced its intention to go public, a strategic move following the U.S. sanctions in 2020 that severely impacted Huawei's access to essential technologies and led to Honor's divestiture.

Despite being a dominant force in China's smartphone industry, Honor's international presence remains limited. To enhance its global image and market share, the company recently launched two premium foldable models.

As part of its IPO preparation, Honor is overhauling its Board of Directors to ensure diversity and adherence to regulatory standards required for public companies. The restructuring is a critical step in the company's strategy to secure various sources of funding and strengthen its position in the competitive tech industry.

Further cementing its ambition in the luxury segment, Honor introduced its new high-end Magic Vs foldable phone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona with a $1,700 price tag. This move signifies Honor's commitment to capturing a slice of the premium market dominated by giants like Apple and Samsung. While the company did not disclose the listing venue for its IPO, this development marks a significant milestone in Honor's independent journey since separating from Huawei.

This expansion in production capacity comes as Apple (NASDAQ: ) exclusively utilizes TSMC's N3B node for its upcoming high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.

Each wafer used in these models costs approximately $20,000, with initial yields around 50%. However, by August, reports indicated an improvement in yields nearing 75%, with TSMC absorbing the costs for any defective units. This enhancement in the manufacturing process is critical as it may lead to a doubling of TSMC’s revenue from such processes next year.

Furthermore, the projected increases in wafer production are set to rise from tens of thousands per month to one hundred thousand by the end of the year. This surge is attributed to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s Snapdragon model and MediaTek’s Dimensity chipset, which are also entering production on TSMC's N3E node.

For Apple, revenue projections from its A17 Pro and M3 chips are estimated to reach billions this year for TSMC. Despite the substantial income, Apple itself has faced billions in tape-out process costs for these advanced chipsets, including the M3 Pro and M3 Max models.

In an unrelated development, Moscow has initiated a pilot project using ""robocats"" in three hospitals. These robotic assistants are designed to streamline patient services by distributing meals and medicine and offering health guidance.

The evidentiary portion of the Google vs DOJ legal battle has concluded and, Evercore said that while much of the evidence and testimony was behind closed doors, ""there were some interesting details disclosed during the public part of the trial.""

During the trial, It was disclosed that Google paid $26.3B to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others for default search placement in 2021. Evercore thinks ""the majority of this went to Apple.""

""We now estimate that Apple earns $18-20B from the Google relationship vs our prior estimate of $12-15B,"" the analysts stated. The firm also noted that it was disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from Safari search traffic.

The next step for the case will be closing arguments, which are scheduled for May 1 to 3, 2024. After that, the judge will issue a ruling.

If Google is found to have violated antitrust law, then the potential penalties could range from ordering greater transparency in the negotiating process to a break up of Google (very unlikely), explained the analysts at Evercore.

""The potential punishment that would have the greatest impact on Apple would be for the judge to forbid the payment for default search placement arrangement. Assuming Apple earns $19B/year from the Google deal, this would imply ~17% of Apple's net income is at risk if the judge rules the deal is anti-competitive behavior,"" they added.

Analysts at Evercore estimate it will likely be nine to 12 months before there is a ruling from the judge, which would be followed by a second trial and a lengthy appeals process, so it could be multiple years before this case is fully settled.

Even so, the firm continues to think Google has a stronger case."

Largan is the primary supplier of tetraprism lenses for Apple, with supply shares of 85 to 90 per cent.

Earlier this month, the analyst predicted that Apple will upgrade the entire lineup of iPad in 2024 and add a new larger 12.9-inch iPad Air along with the 10.9-inch model.

In a recent post, they explained that the equipment used to manufacture chips for the iPhone's version of Touch ID has been permanently shut down, with the only remaining units used for the third-generation iPhone SE.

This suggests that Apple isn't planning to bring back Touch ID as a method of authentication on the iPhone anytime soon, reports MacRumors.

The report also noted that there are no credible rumours concerning the return of Apple's fingerprint-scanning technology for the iPhone 16 series.

According to reports, the fourth-generation iPhone SE will include Face ID, replacing the only iPhone model that still uses Touch ID.

Meanwhile, Apple has announced it will support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in 2024. In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

""Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,"" an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway divests from long-held stocks amid market shifts,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-divests-from-longheld-stocks-amid-market-shifts-93CH-3910431,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has made significant changes to its investment portfolio, according to recent SEC filings. The company has completely divested from several long-standing holdings, including General Motors (NYSE:NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE:NYSE: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE: ), amid various economic pressures and strategic shifts.

The move comes as Berkshire's Class A shares have seen a near 4,400,000% gain since Buffett took the helm in the mid-1960s. Investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been active in reshaping the portfolio during the third quarter. The exit from General Motors, held since the first quarter of 2012, was likely influenced by increased labor costs following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union and a downturn in electric vehicle demand as loan rates rise.

Similarly, UPS, part of Berkshire's portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, saw its remaining shares sold due to economic uncertainties and higher labor expenses stemming from new labor contracts. Mondelez International, with popular brands like Oreo and Ritz under its belt since the second quarter of 2007, was dropped amidst consumer resistance to price hikes and concerns over a heavy debt load that echoed issues seen during Kraft Heinz’s writedown incident.

Procter & Gamble, a Berkshire holding since the first quarter of 2005, was released as it faced volume declines and currency headwinds. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson, a staple in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, was sold off due to litigation issues related to talc cancer claims and Buffett’s preference not to closely track drug development catalysts—despite JNJ's strong value proposition indicated by its rare AAA credit rating.

Despite these sell-offs, Apple (NASDAQ: ) remains Berkshire's dominant position even though it experienced a valuation dip. Reduced positions were also noted in other companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), HP Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ), Aon (NYSE:NYSE: ), Markel (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Globe Life (NYSE:NYSE: ).

In contrast to these divestments, Berkshire Hathaway has made new investments including an $8 million interest in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and expanded holdings in Liberty Media with stakes in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Liberty Live Group. In addition to these acquisitions, Berkshire invested a fresh $44 million in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: ). To maintain competitive secrecy, Berkshire has sought confidential treatment for an undisclosed new holding.

With these portfolio adjustments reflecting Buffett's strategic thinking amid current market dynamics, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have soared to a record $157 billion. This substantial cash pile underscores the conglomerate's ability to capitalize on investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns.

Despite being a dominant force in China's smartphone industry, Honor's international presence remains limited. To enhance its global image and market share, the company recently launched two premium foldable models.

As part of its IPO preparation, Honor is overhauling its Board of Directors to ensure diversity and adherence to regulatory standards required for public companies. The restructuring is a critical step in the company's strategy to secure various sources of funding and strengthen its position in the competitive tech industry.

Further cementing its ambition in the luxury segment, Honor introduced its new high-end Magic Vs foldable phone at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona with a $1,700 price tag. This move signifies Honor's commitment to capturing a slice of the premium market dominated by giants like Apple and Samsung. While the company did not disclose the listing venue for its IPO, this development marks a significant milestone in Honor's independent journey since separating from Huawei.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,Apple and TSMC ramp up advanced chip production for iPhone 15 Pro series,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-tsmc-ramp-up-advanced-chip-production-for-iphone-15-pro-series-93CH-3910194,"TSMC is set to significantly increase its production of advanced 3-nanometer technology chips, which are expected to power a wide array of technologies, from smartphone CPUs to AI applications for various major companies. This expansion in production capacity comes as Apple (NASDAQ: ) exclusively utilizes TSMC's N3B node for its upcoming high-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max models.

Each wafer used in these models costs approximately $20,000, with initial yields around 50%. However, by August, reports indicated an improvement in yields nearing 75%, with TSMC absorbing the costs for any defective units. This enhancement in the manufacturing process is critical as it may lead to a doubling of TSMC’s revenue from such processes next year.

Furthermore, the projected increases in wafer production are set to rise from tens of thousands per month to one hundred thousand by the end of the year. This surge is attributed to Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s Snapdragon model and MediaTek’s Dimensity chipset, which are also entering production on TSMC's N3E node.

For Apple, revenue projections from its A17 Pro and M3 chips are estimated to reach billions this year for TSMC. Despite the substantial income, Apple itself has faced billions in tape-out process costs for these advanced chipsets, including the M3 Pro and M3 Max models.

In an unrelated development, Moscow has initiated a pilot project using ""robocats"" in three hospitals. These robotic assistants are designed to streamline patient services by distributing meals and medicine and offering health guidance.

2022-11-21, Investing.com,Evercore ISI says Google has a stronger case in DoJ trial,https://in.investing.com/news/evercore-isi-says-google-has-a-stronger-case-in-doj-trial-432SI-3908364,"Analysts at Evercore ISI provided their thoughts on what they learned from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: )/DOJ trial in a note Tuesday.

The evidentiary portion of the Google vs DOJ legal battle has concluded and, Evercore said that while much of the evidence and testimony was behind closed doors, ""there were some interesting details disclosed during the public part of the trial.""

During the trial, It was disclosed that Google paid $26.3B to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others for default search placement in 2021. Evercore thinks ""the majority of this went to Apple.""

""We now estimate that Apple earns $18-20B from the Google relationship vs our prior estimate of $12-15B,"" the analysts stated. The firm also noted that it was disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from Safari search traffic.

The next step for the case will be closing arguments, which are scheduled for May 1 to 3, 2024. After that, the judge will issue a ruling.

If Google is found to have violated antitrust law, then the potential penalties could range from ordering greater transparency in the negotiating process to a break up of Google (very unlikely), explained the analysts at Evercore.

""The potential punishment that would have the greatest impact on Apple would be for the judge to forbid the payment for default search placement arrangement. Assuming Apple earns $19B/year from the Google deal, this would imply ~17% of Apple's net income is at risk if the judge rules the deal is anti-competitive behavior,"" they added.

Analysts at Evercore estimate it will likely be nine to 12 months before there is a ruling from the judge, which would be followed by a second trial and a lengthy appeals process, so it could be multiple years before this case is fully settled.

Even so, the firm continues to think Google has a stronger case."

The common medical uses of these devices include remote patient monitoring and telehealth services to track and monitor vital signs such as heart rate, glucose levels, and blood pressure.

“Wearable devices that are used for medical purposes, such as fitness trackers and health monitors, continue to gain significant popularity among all types of users,” said Brian Hicks, Senior Analyst of Medical Devices at GlobalData -- a leading data and analytics company, in a statement.

""These devices can be worn on the body, most commonly as smartwatches on the wrist or even be incorporated into clothing, and these are often used in conjunction with mobile health apps,"" he added.

Data from these devices can be transmitted in real-time to healthcare providers, enabling remote monitoring and timely interventions.

Furthermore, these devices offer more consumer-oriented features, such as comprehensive fitness monitoring, personalised coaching, stylish designs, and integration with AI algorithms, enabling proactive self-care.

“The recent trends in this market primarily centre around the underlying technological advancements of the new product generations. These include the expansion of more health features, the integration of AI for personalised recommendations, and the ability to transmit real-time data to healthcare providers for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes,” Hicks said.

In addition to the wearable devices themselves, the development of healthcare apps that can not only monitor and track various health parameters but also predict outcomes and symptoms based on previous observations, and even provide valuable information to medical professionals, has also been rapidly growing.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Garmin remain leaders in the smartwatches segment of the wearable technology market for medical purposes, as they were among the first to make wearable devices with fitness trackers and other health-related features.

There are also disruptors entering the market with innovative health features, some of which include technology companies such as Asus, Motorola, and Swatch.

“These devices are becoming more integrated into the healthcare industry, especially in patient monitoring, remote training and support, and telehealth services. Some notable advancements include H2O Therapeutics' app for monitoring Parkinson's disease symptoms using the Apple Watch,”Hicks said.

(TSMC) is considering the addition of a third plant in Kumamoto, Japan, which may produce cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips for major clients such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). This move aligns with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's robust drive for technological investments. However, the start dates for the plant remain unclear, with concerns that by the time it launches, newer technologies might surpass the planned advancements.

Japan's proactive approach to semiconductor manufacturing is further emphasized by Rapidus Corp.'s efforts to enter the sub-5nm chip market, a direct response to the delayed funding allocation from the U.S. Chips Act. TSMC's projected $20 billion investment in its Japan venture could be significantly reduced through Japanese government subsidies. The company is already moving forward with Sony (NYSE: ) Group Corp.-supported facilities expected to commence production of advanced chips by late 2024, with ambitions to initiate finer-scale production by 2025.

Despite challenges such as land scarcity that could hinder expansion outside Kumamoto, TSMC's strategy indicates a strong commitment to global diversification. This is crucial given the geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan Strait relations. The strategic importance of Japan's semiconductor sector is evidenced by corporate interest from companies such as Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Co., and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Cross-industry collaborations are also taking shape, with companies like Denso Corp. contributing to economic growth prospects. According to SMBC Nikko Securities' analysis, these developments are set to significantly boost the GDP of the Kyushu region, which includes Kumamoto, showcasing Japan's increasing value in the global tech landscape and TSMC's comprehensive strategy for worldwide market presence amidst ongoing uncertainties.

The firm announced plans to allow clients to invest in government and corporate debt opportunities across Europe and the US. This strategic move is designed to enhance accessibility for retail investors by significantly lowering the minimum investment requirement from the typical $100,000 to a more attainable €100.

The initiative comes as Revolut seeks to democratize access to a market with an estimated value of €120 trillion. CEO Rolandas Juteika highlighted the company's commitment to opening up bond market access, with a portfolio that will include government bonds and prominent corporate bonds from entities such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ).

Revolut's expansion into bond trading builds on its existing offerings, which already include over 70 European stocks, more than 2,200 US equities, and around 150 ETFs. With the global bond market valued at $133 trillion in 2022, Revolut's approach could significantly increase retail investor participation in this traditionally less accessible sector.

Despite these ambitious plans, Revolut faces regulatory challenges in securing a UK banking license. The company has been under scrutiny due to compliance issues that have arisen from unverified revenues and an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into suspected unauthorized account withdrawals.

2022-11-20, Investing.com,"Microsoft hires Sam Altman, Cruise CEO resigns - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-cruise-ceo-resigns--whats-moving-markets-3905682,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edged higher ahead of the first day of a Thanksgiving-shortened trading week, as investors geared up for minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting and earnings from AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday. Sam Altman is set to join Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) after a dramatic weekend saw his ouster from the helm of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Elsewhere, Cruise boss Kyle Vogt resigns following a series of recent missteps at the robotaxi group.

1. Futures inch up

U.S. stock futures hovered just above the flatline to begin a holiday-shortened trading week, with investors looking ahead to upcoming minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting as they attempt to gauge the central bank's future policy path.

By 05:09 ET (10:09 GMT), the contract had added 26 points or 0.1%, had gained 6 points or 0.1%, and had risen by 32 points or 0.2%.

The main indices on Wall Street ended the prior session marginally in the green, helping the benchmark and 30-stock post their first three-week winning streaks since the summer. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy surged to its best week since June.

On Tuesday, traders will have the opportunity to parse through minutes from the Fed's November meeting, where officials chose to keep interest rates steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The release will likely be one of the highlights of the economic calendar in a week truncated by Thanksgiving festivities.

Corporate earnings this week will also feature quarterly figures from Nvidia, the California chipmaker that has become a focal point of this year's surge in enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Lowe's (NYSE: ) will report as well, becoming the latest big-box retailer to provide an update on the state of the U.S. consumer heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.

2. Altman to run Microsoft's new AI team - Nadella

Microsoft is set to hire Sam Altman to lead a new advanced artificial intelligence research team, in a move that comes just days after the prominent AI-industry figure was ousted as CEO of OpenAI.

In a post on social media platform X announcing the appointment, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote that he is ""look[ing] forward to moving quickly"" to provide Altman and Greg Brockman -- who was also removed from his role as OpenAI president -- ""with the resources needed for their success.""

Earlier on Monday, The Information reported that Altman, one of the leading voices in a global debate over the rapid expansion of nascent AI technology, will no longer return as OpenAI's CEO despite executive efforts to rehire him. The report cited an internal address by co-founder and board director Ilya Sutskever.

Instead, OpenAI will hire streaming site Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO, according to media reports.

Altman was seen meeting with OpenAI’s board over the weekend, after he was unexpectedly sacked on Friday and replaced on an interim basis by Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. The turmoil, which The Information said followed an internal disagreement over AI safety, threatens to cast a pall over the direction of OpenAI just one week after its megapopular chatbot ChatGPT reached 100 million weekly users.

3. Cruise CEO resigns

The chief executive of General Motors-backed Cruise has stepped down in the wake of a highly-publicized accident that led to the halt of its self-driving vehicle operations.

CEO Kyle Vogt confirmed his departure in a post on X on Sunday, adding that the group ""is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead.""

Reuters reported that Vogt, who founded the firm in 2013, told employees in an email that he had ""resigned from my position."" Earlier in the weekend, Vogt had reportedly apologized to staff, saying ""[t]here are no excuses, and there is no sugar coating what has happened.""

The leadership shake-up comes after the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Cruise of not disclosing all video footage of an accident in October in which a pedestrian was dragged by one of its self-drive taxis. Cruise has said it ""proactively shared"" information with authorities.

The California DMV later ordered Cruise to remove all of its cars from state roads, warning that they present a risk to the public. Cruise also suspended all vehicle operations and announced a recall of 950 of its robotaxis.

4. Foxconn EV start-up sees shares slip in debut

Shares in major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn's electric vehicle unit fell in their debut trading day in Taipei on Monday, weighed down by concerns over the outlook for the highly competitive EV market.

Foxtron Vehicle Technologies ended the day down by 2.7%, paring back some losses following a drop of as much as 9%, giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $2.7 billion. It raised T$7.5B ($1 = 31.7350 Taiwan dollars) in its initial public offering.

Foxtron, a joint venture between iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn and carmaker Yulon, currently faces a host of challenges, including pricing pressures and supply chain constraints.

Chairman Young Liu, however, stressed that Foxtron still has a clear growth plan. The group has said it has received over 9,000 orders for its Model C vehicle, and expects to carry out deliveries by the end of June next year.

5. Oil rises on output cut hopes

Oil prices rose Monday, extending recent gains following reports that a group of major producers may discuss deeper output cuts when they meet later this month.

By 05:10 ET, the futures traded 0.6% higher at $76.52 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.7% to $81.13 per barrel.

Oil prices have dropped by almost 20% since late September on demand growth fears as well as easing worries of Middle East supply disruption amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

However, crude gained 4% on Friday and continued to rise Monday after Reuters reported, citing sources, that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, is set to consider whether to make additional oil supply cuts to shore up prices when it meets on Nov. 26.

The group, particularly major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, has already pledged total oil output cuts of 5.16 million barrels per day, or about 5% of daily global demand, in a series of steps that started in late 2022."

2022-11-20, Investing.com,"Apple faces delays in custom modem development, sticks with Qualcomm until 2025",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-faces-delays-in-custom-modem-development-sticks-with-qualcomm-until-2025-93CH-3905403,"CUPERTINO – Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has encountered significant delays in the development of its own 5G modems, which means the tech giant will continue to depend on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for its modem needs until late 2025 or possibly into early 2026. Despite the postponement, Apple's strategy remains focused on eventually incorporating these custom modems into future iPhones before expanding to other devices.

The internal development of custom 5G modems by Apple is a part of the company's broader goal to take greater control over its hardware components, which is expected to improve profit margins and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers. However, this ambition has hit a snag as the anticipated launch for the modems in iPhones will not happen before late 2025.

According to Bloomberg, after the debut of these modems in iPhones, it may take an additional two to three years before they are fully integrated into other products such as iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. During this transition period, Qualcomm is set to remain a key supplier for Apple and may impose additional charges once their current agreement expires.

Apple is also working on proprietary Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips aimed at decreasing its dependency on Broadcom (NASDAQ: ). However, like its modem development, these efforts have faced setbacks. The integration of custom modems into system-on-a-chip configurations is part of Apple's long-term plan to enhance its product lineup and profitability.

As Apple navigates through these developmental challenges, it underscores the complexities involved in innovating and producing cutting-edge technology components in-house. The company's continued partnership with Qualcomm ensures that Apple can maintain the supply of critical components for its devices while it works towards self-sufficiency in modem production.

Apple is expected to introduce OLED displays on the iPad mini and iPad Air in 2026, following their introduction on both iPad Pro models next year, reports MacRumors.

The news was first reported by Taiwan's ET News. While the iPad Air will keep its 10.9-inch display, the iPad mini's screen will expand from 8.3 to 8.7 inches.

Apple will introduce OLED display technology to the rumoured 12.9-inch iPad Air model in 2027, which is expected to debut with an LCD display early next year, the report mentioned.

Moreover, the tech giant plans to upgrade the iPad Pro's OLED panels in 2027 to a next-generation panel with improved light efficiency via Color Filter on Encapsulation (CoE), which is expected to reduce power consumption by around 20 per cent.

The use of a colour filter may also allow Apple to implement under-display camera technology for the first time on the iPad, according to the report. In addition, the report said that Apple is rumoured to bring OLED to the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2025, followed by the 14-inch model in 2026.

In 2026, the 13-and 15-inch MacBook Air models will also switch from LCD to OLED. Meanwhile, Apple has announced to support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in later 2024.

In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

He responded to a conspiracy theory that motivated the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.

A White House spokesman said that Musk’s endorsement of the post was ""unacceptable"".

""We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,"" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates was quoted as saying in reports..

""It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,"" Bates added.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that their point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should stop across the board.

""When it comes to this platform -- X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's no place for it anywhere in the world -- it's ugly and wrong. Full stop,"" she said in an earlier post.

Last week, non-profit Media Matters in its report claimed that as Musk continues his descent into white nationalist and antisemitic conspiracy theories, his social media platform has been placing ads for major brands like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bravo (NBCUniversal), IBM (NYSE: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Xfinity (Comcast (NASDAQ: )) next to content that supports Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.

The report led to tech and media majors like Apple, IBM, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery, Paramount and Comcast/NBCUniversal reportedly pulling or halting their advertisements, along with Lionsgate and European Commission, on X.

Musk on Saturday said that X will file a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against Media Matters and those who “colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company”.

“Their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them,” he added.

Musk also posted a letter, defending his company and slamming Media Matters report and legacy media organisation.

“Despite our clear and consistent position, X has seen a number of attacks from activist groups like Media Matters and legacy media outlets who seek to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they perceive it as a threat to their ideological narrative and those of their financial supporters,” the letter read.

The letter alleged that these groups try to use their influence to attack “our revenue streams by deceiving advertisers on X”.

“To manipulate the public and advertisers, Media Matters created an alternate account and curated the posts and advertising appearing on the account's timeline to misinform advertisers about the placement of their posts,” the letter argued.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

As a result, investors should ""get the popcorn ready with Fed fears fading,"" the analysts wrote in their note.

""Heading into 2024, we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,"" they said.

Wedbush believes that while IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, cloud and AI-driven spending will be up 20% to 25% over the next year ""with use cases now exploding"" in the enterprise and consumer landscape.

The Wall Street firm also predicts ""a short covering for the ages"" for the tech sector into year-end is on the horizon ""as the fundamental picture for growth tech stocks is rock solid"" based on their recent checks. ""We believe the new tech bull market has now begun, and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector,"" the analysts added.

Furthermore, the analysts said they view AI as ""the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995"" and think many on the Street are underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spending set to happen over the next decade. They described this as a bonanza for the chip and software sectors, looking forward to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and MSFT leading the way.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,Apple and Amazon shares surge amid tech market challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-amazon-shares-surge-amid-tech-market-challenges-93CH-3904970,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). are demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of a challenging technology market, with their shares climbing 44% and 73% respectively. Apple, the consumer electronics giant valued at $2.9 trillion, has managed to limit its revenue decline to just 3% despite an 11% drop in iPhone sales, maintaining a dominant 55% market share in the U.S. smartphone sector. The company's venture into artificial intelligence (AI) areas further bolsters its strong market prospects.

On the other side, Amazon has made a significant turnaround from its previous e-commerce losses, posting an impressive $4 billion in operating income for the recent quarter. This recovery is attributed to strategic cost reductions and layoffs that have helped it navigate economic downturns. Amazon continues to lead in both e-commerce and cloud computing, with AWS maintaining its supremacy in the market.

These industry-leading companies are not only favorites among global shoppers but are also setting records that underscore their technological dominance. As they continue to expand into sectors expected to grow substantially, their positions seem well-poised for future success.

While these two tech titans are thriving, The Motley Fool's Stock Advisor suggests there are ten other stocks that could potentially outperform Apple for investors at this time. However, the current achievements of Apple and Amazon highlight their adaptability and robust performance even as the broader U.S. smartphone market faces difficulties, as reported by Counterpoint Research data.

Both companies' share growth reflects investor confidence and their ability to capitalize on market opportunities despite broader economic pressures. With Apple reaching new peaks in consumer electronics and Amazon showcasing its resilience in e-commerce and cloud services, these firms exemplify enduring strength in the volatile tech industry.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3904586,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."
2022-11-17, Investing.com,Apple's stock performance stalls as tech rivals advance,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-stock-performance-stalls-as-tech-rivals-advance-93CH-3904521,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is facing growing investor unease as its stock performance lags behind tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), who are making strides in emergent technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Apple's reliance on hardware sales, which include its flagship iPhone and Mac products, has been a cornerstone of its growth strategy. However, this focus is now seen as a potential vulnerability as the company's diversification efforts, through services like iCloud, Apple TV, and Apple Music, are closely linked to its hardware success.

The Cupertino-based tech behemoth has recently reduced order forecasts for new products like the iPhone 15, iPad, and MacBook Air. This move suggests a possible lack of innovation and signals a deceleration in growth—a stark contrast to the sales boom experienced in the post-COVID period. As Apple grapples with maintaining these heightened sales levels without significant investments in cutting-edge technologies or diversification beyond its core hardware and services, the company's stock faces potential headwinds amid a broader economic slowdown.

Despite these challenges, Apple's services sector has demonstrated resilience, expanding by 9% year-over-year in the last quarter even as other areas faltered. This growth underscores the increasing significance of recurring revenue streams for the company. Yet, this bright spot is not without its own challenges; service sales are dependent on hardware volume, meaning that any major downturn in iPhone and Mac sales could impair efforts to bolster services revenue from an otherwise stagnant user base.

While immediate breakthrough technologies from Apple may not be on the horizon, the company is still expected to achieve approximately 10% annual revenue growth over the next decade. In the past ten years, AAPL stock has climbed nearly 28%, and looking ahead, it is anticipated to appreciate by 15-20% annually. For investors considering AAPL stock, the prevailing advice is to remain steadfast through market fluctuations and capitalize on long-term compounding by reinvesting dividends.

Investors are encouraged to look beyond short-term uncertainties and focus on Apple's predictable hardware refresh cycles and high-margin services ecosystem. These factors could provide steady gains over time, even as the market eagerly awaits any new innovations that could reignite Apple's growth trajectory.

2022-11-17, IANS,9 prominent leaders hailing from India named in 'Time 100 Climate' list,https://in.investing.com/news/9-prominent-leaders-hailing-from-india-named-in-time-100-climate-list-3904448,"New York, Nov 17 (IANS) Nine prominent leaders hailing from India have been named to the 'Time 100 Climate', the magazine's first-ever list of the world's most influential leaders driving business to real climate action.The list, which includes CEOs, founders, philanthropists, musicians, policymakers and government officials from across the world, comes ahead of the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from November 30.

""It’s fair to say climate leadership is ­embedded across all of our coverage today. But we believe more could be done to draw attention to the people who are shaping and leading climate action,"" Time said, releasing the list on Thursday.

According to Time, Ajay Banga, who began his five-year term as World Bank Group president in June, is ushering in a new mission for the institution -- eradicating poverty while fighting climate change.

Banga is calling for more money to “widen the aperture” of the Bank to structure incentives and loans for projects that lower emissions and advance sustainable development.

He is also pushing to reduce how long it takes to approve projects, so that billions of dollars can quickly reach the countries that need it.

Some 70 per cent of the vehicles on India’s roads are mopeds and scooters, and Bhavish Aggarwal is leading the path to electrifying them.

He is the CEO and co-founder of Ola Electric, India’s largest maker of electric two-wheel scooters, and a market leader in micromobility generally, from taxis to ride-sharing.

This year, Ola launched its most affordable electric scooter ever, priced at Rs 79,999.

Rajiv J. Shah is president of The Rockefeller Foundation, which now works to ensure that all initiatives and investment strategies are focused through a climate lens.

This year, the Foundation partnered with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet to launch the Coal to Clean Credit Initiative. The aim is to develop a new carbon finance standard to spur a just transition away from coal-fired power plants to renewable energy in emerging economies.

Geeta Aiyer is founder and president of Boston Common Asset Management, a woman-led, employee-owned sustainable investment firm with nearly $5 billion in assets under management.

The firm prioritises investment in climate change mitigation, and uses shareholder engagement to push portfolio companies toward more sustainable business practices.

Jigar Shah is director of the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, which is responsible for the public investment of hundreds of billions of dollars into clean infrastructure and energy projects.

""The solutions to meeting the President’s decarbonisation goals are already within our grasp. It’s a matter of doing rather than waiting for a breakthrough,"" Shah told the Time.

Manoj Sinha is CEO and co-founder of Husk Power Systems, which operates 200 minigrids across Asia and Africa, and reached profitability in India and Nigeria this year.

According to Sinha, the most important climate legislation that could pass in the next year is the imposition of a uniform carbon tax.

M. Sanjayan is a conservation scientist and CEO of Conservation International (CI), a non-profit working with governments and companies to conserve nature, primarily in the Global South.

Sanjayan’s skills as a science communicator have helped CI facilitate powerful partnerships for environmental protection.

The organisation created the Restore Fund in 2021 alongside Apple (NASDAQ: ), which this year pledged $200 million in additional funding to support nature-based carbon removal technologies.

Seema Wadhwa is executive director for environmental stewardship for Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest health care providers in the US.

By 2050, it aims to be net zero.

Under Wadhwa’s leadership, this year Kaiser Permanente’s office in Santa Rosa, California, was recognised as the country’s first net-zero medical facility.

Amit Kumar Sinha is managing director and CEO of Mahindra Lifespaces, the real estate and infrastructure development arm of Indian conglomerate company Mahindra Group.

Since 2013, Mahindra Lifespaces says it has had an entirely green portfolio, prioritizing water efficiency, passive energy design, renewables, and more.

Xi received standing ovations from more than 300 corporate leaders and top officials, including Cook and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman.

Musk on Friday posted his photo with the Chinese President on X, saying, “May there be prosperity for all”.

The gala dinner was hosted by the US-China Business Council and the National Committee on US-China Relations.

“Whatever stage of development it may reach, China will never pursue hegemony or expansion, and will never impose its will on others,” the President told the gathering.

Earlier, US President Joe Biden told his Chinese counterpart that they should keep their communications lines open and get to understand each other so as “to ensure that competition (between their countries) does not veer into conflict”.

Xi reiterated his opposition to describing the relationship as competition saying it “is not the prevailing trend of current times”.

Biden said that the US is not trying to ""decouple"" from China, but pursuing better relations with its assertive rival.

Xi arrived in San Francisco this week for a summit with Biden, and to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting.

2022-11-17, IANS,"iPhones will support rich communication services in late 2024, confirms Apple",https://in.investing.com/news/iphones-will-support-rich-communication-services-in-late-2024-confirms-apple-3904340,"San Francisco, Nov 17 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) has announced to support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in later 2024.In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

“Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,” an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying.

This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users, said the company.

Apple’s decision came amid pressure from regulators, like European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), and competitors like Google (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). RCS brings iMessage-style features to cross-platform texts.

The iPhone adopting RCS could enable support for encryption, read receipts, typing indicators, high-res images and videos while sending texts between iPhone and Android devices.

Apple will let users share locations in text threads and RCS messages will be green, like SMS messages.

However, Apple is not opening up iMessage to other platforms but instead replace SMS and MMS and “exist separately from iMessage when available.”

In September, the European Commission opened up an investigation into iMessage to determine whether it should be considered a “core platform service.”

Apple argued iMessage isn’t popular enough in Europe for the rules to apply.

Google and Samsung have been pushing for Apple to add support for RCS.

“Everybody should have secure and modern messaging without worrying what kind of phone they’re texting to. So glad to see Apple joining our ongoing work with the GSMA on RCS to make texting better for all,” ,” Google SVP of platforms and ecosystems, Hiroshi Lockheimer, posted on X.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Apple to support RCS messaging, boosting Android interoperability",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-support-rcs-messaging-boosting-android-interoperability-93CH-3904322,"CUPERTINO - In a strategic pivot, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced its plan to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) Universal Profile, a messaging standard widely used by Android devices, including those from tech rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (KS: ). This move marks a significant shift from Apple's previous stance on messaging interoperability and comes as the company faces regulatory pressure from the European Union's Digital Markets Act.

The integration of RCS into iPhones, starting with the iPhone 15 series, is expected to enhance user experience by improving cross-platform messaging capabilities. RCS is set to replace traditional SMS and MMS services, offering a richer communication experience akin to Apple's own iMessage platform. While iMessage is known for its robust privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, RCS does not currently offer the same level of security. Nevertheless, Apple is committed to maintaining user privacy and continues to promote iMessage as its premier messaging service due to its superior security measures.

The announcement on Thursday aligns with the appeal deadline for the EU's Digital Markets Act, which mandates service interoperability among large technology firms. In 2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook dismissed the idea of adopting cross-platform RCS, advocating instead for consumers to purchase iPhones to enjoy exclusive iMessage features. However, this policy change indicates a more collaborative approach to messaging standards and could potentially reshape how iPhone users communicate with Android users.

By supporting RCS Universal Profile, Apple is taking steps toward creating a more unified messaging ecosystem that transcends device boundaries while attempting to uphold its commitment to user privacy and security.

The common medical uses of these devices include remote patient monitoring and telehealth services to track and monitor vital signs such as heart rate, glucose levels, and blood pressure.

“Wearable devices that are used for medical purposes, such as fitness trackers and health monitors, continue to gain significant popularity among all types of users,” said Brian Hicks, Senior Analyst of Medical Devices at GlobalData -- a leading data and analytics company, in a statement.

""These devices can be worn on the body, most commonly as smartwatches on the wrist or even be incorporated into clothing, and these are often used in conjunction with mobile health apps,"" he added.

Data from these devices can be transmitted in real-time to healthcare providers, enabling remote monitoring and timely interventions.

Furthermore, these devices offer more consumer-oriented features, such as comprehensive fitness monitoring, personalised coaching, stylish designs, and integration with AI algorithms, enabling proactive self-care.

“The recent trends in this market primarily centre around the underlying technological advancements of the new product generations. These include the expansion of more health features, the integration of AI for personalised recommendations, and the ability to transmit real-time data to healthcare providers for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes,” Hicks said.

In addition to the wearable devices themselves, the development of healthcare apps that can not only monitor and track various health parameters but also predict outcomes and symptoms based on previous observations, and even provide valuable information to medical professionals, has also been rapidly growing.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Garmin remain leaders in the smartwatches segment of the wearable technology market for medical purposes, as they were among the first to make wearable devices with fitness trackers and other health-related features.

There are also disruptors entering the market with innovative health features, some of which include technology companies such as Asus, Motorola, and Swatch.

(TSMC) is considering the addition of a third plant in Kumamoto, Japan, which may produce cutting-edge 3-nanometer chips for major clients such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). This move aligns with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's robust drive for technological investments. However, the start dates for the plant remain unclear, with concerns that by the time it launches, newer technologies might surpass the planned advancements.

Japan's proactive approach to semiconductor manufacturing is further emphasized by Rapidus Corp.'s efforts to enter the sub-5nm chip market, a direct response to the delayed funding allocation from the U.S. Chips Act. TSMC's projected $20 billion investment in its Japan venture could be significantly reduced through Japanese government subsidies. The company is already moving forward with Sony (NYSE: ) Group Corp.-supported facilities expected to commence production of advanced chips by late 2024, with ambitions to initiate finer-scale production by 2025.

Despite challenges such as land scarcity that could hinder expansion outside Kumamoto, TSMC's strategy indicates a strong commitment to global diversification. This is crucial given the geopolitical tensions surrounding Taiwan Strait relations. The strategic importance of Japan's semiconductor sector is evidenced by corporate interest from companies such as Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Co., and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Cross-industry collaborations are also taking shape, with companies like Denso Corp. contributing to economic growth prospects. According to SMBC Nikko Securities' analysis, these developments are set to significantly boost the GDP of the Kyushu region, which includes Kumamoto, showcasing Japan's increasing value in the global tech landscape and TSMC's comprehensive strategy for worldwide market presence amidst ongoing uncertainties.

The firm announced plans to allow clients to invest in government and corporate debt opportunities across Europe and the US. This strategic move is designed to enhance accessibility for retail investors by significantly lowering the minimum investment requirement from the typical $100,000 to a more attainable €100.

The initiative comes as Revolut seeks to democratize access to a market with an estimated value of €120 trillion. CEO Rolandas Juteika highlighted the company's commitment to opening up bond market access, with a portfolio that will include government bonds and prominent corporate bonds from entities such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ).

Revolut's expansion into bond trading builds on its existing offerings, which already include over 70 European stocks, more than 2,200 US equities, and around 150 ETFs. With the global bond market valued at $133 trillion in 2022, Revolut's approach could significantly increase retail investor participation in this traditionally less accessible sector.

Despite these ambitious plans, Revolut faces regulatory challenges in securing a UK banking license. The company has been under scrutiny due to compliance issues that have arisen from unverified revenues and an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into suspected unauthorized account withdrawals. As Revolut navigates these hurdles, its proposed foray into the bond market represents a potentially transformative development for individual investors across Europe.

Despite mixed reactions to near-term revenue projections earlier in November, analysts from BofA Securities have maintained a Buy rating on Arm. The analysts' confidence in the company stems from its potential to outpace competitors over the next three years through market share expansion and increased royalty rates.

Arm's CFO Jason Child also contributed to the positive outlook, hinting at ""pretty significant growth"" driven by sizeable license agreements expected in the fourth quarter.

On Tuesday, traders will have the opportunity to parse through minutes from the Fed's November meeting, where officials chose to keep interest rates steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%. The release will likely be one of the highlights of the economic calendar in a week truncated by Thanksgiving festivities.

Corporate earnings this week will also feature quarterly figures from Nvidia, the California chipmaker that has become a focal point of this year's surge in enthusiasm over generative artificial intelligence. Lowe's (NYSE: ) will report as well, becoming the latest big-box retailer to provide an update on the state of the U.S. consumer heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.

2. Altman to run Microsoft's new AI team - Nadella

Microsoft is set to hire Sam Altman to lead a new advanced artificial intelligence research team, in a move that comes just days after the prominent AI-industry figure was ousted as CEO of OpenAI.

In a post on social media platform X announcing the appointment, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote that he is ""look[ing] forward to moving quickly"" to provide Altman and Greg Brockman -- who was also removed from his role as OpenAI president -- ""with the resources needed for their success.""

Earlier on Monday, The Information reported that Altman, one of the leading voices in a global debate over the rapid expansion of nascent AI technology, will no longer return as OpenAI's CEO despite executive efforts to rehire him. The report cited an internal address by co-founder and board director Ilya Sutskever.

Instead, OpenAI will hire streaming site Twitch co-founder Emmett Shear as interim CEO, according to media reports.

Altman was seen meeting with OpenAI’s board over the weekend, after he was unexpectedly sacked on Friday and replaced on an interim basis by Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati. The turmoil, which The Information said followed an internal disagreement over AI safety, threatens to cast a pall over the direction of OpenAI just one week after its megapopular chatbot ChatGPT reached 100 million weekly users.

3. Cruise CEO resigns

The chief executive of General Motors-backed Cruise has stepped down in the wake of a highly-publicized accident that led to the halt of its self-driving vehicle operations.

CEO Kyle Vogt confirmed his departure in a post on X on Sunday, adding that the group ""is still just getting started, and I believe it has a great future ahead.""

Reuters reported that Vogt, who founded the firm in 2013, told employees in an email that he had ""resigned from my position."" Earlier in the weekend, Vogt had reportedly apologized to staff, saying ""[t]here are no excuses, and there is no sugar coating what has happened.""

The leadership shake-up comes after the California Department of Motor Vehicles accused Cruise of not disclosing all video footage of an accident in October in which a pedestrian was dragged by one of its self-drive taxis. Cruise has said it ""proactively shared"" information with authorities.

The California DMV later ordered Cruise to remove all of its cars from state roads, warning that they present a risk to the public. Cruise also suspended all vehicle operations and announced a recall of 950 of its robotaxis.

4. Foxconn EV start-up sees shares slip in debut

Shares in major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier Foxconn's electric vehicle unit fell in their debut trading day in Taipei on Monday, weighed down by concerns over the outlook for the highly competitive EV market.

Foxtron Vehicle Technologies ended the day down by 2.7%, paring back some losses following a drop of as much as 9%, giving the company a market capitalization of roughly $2.7 billion. It raised T$7.5B ($1 = 31.7350 Taiwan dollars) in its initial public offering.

Foxtron, a joint venture between iPhone contract manufacturer Foxconn and carmaker Yulon, currently faces a host of challenges, including pricing pressures and supply chain constraints.

Chairman Young Liu, however, stressed that Foxtron still has a clear growth plan. The group has said it has received over 9,000 orders for its Model C vehicle, and expects to carry out deliveries by the end of June next year.

5. Oil rises on output cut hopes

Oil prices rose Monday, extending recent gains following reports that a group of major producers may discuss deeper output cuts when they meet later this month.

By 05:10 ET, the futures traded 0.6% higher at $76.52 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.7% to $81.13 per barrel.

Oil prices have dropped by almost 20% since late September on demand growth fears as well as easing worries of Middle East supply disruption amid the Israel-Hamas conflict.

However, crude gained 4% on Friday and continued to rise Monday after Reuters reported, citing sources, that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, is set to consider whether to make additional oil supply cuts to shore up prices when it meets on Nov. 26.

The group, particularly major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, has already pledged total oil output cuts of 5.16 million barrels per day, or about 5% of daily global demand, in a series of steps that started in late 2022."

2022-11-20, Investing.com,"Apple faces delays in custom modem development, sticks with Qualcomm until 2025",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-faces-delays-in-custom-modem-development-sticks-with-qualcomm-until-2025-93CH-3905403,"CUPERTINO – Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has encountered significant delays in the development of its own 5G modems, which means the tech giant will continue to depend on Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. for its modem needs until late 2025 or possibly into early 2026. Despite the postponement, Apple's strategy remains focused on eventually incorporating these custom modems into future iPhones before expanding to other devices.

The internal development of custom 5G modems by Apple is a part of the company's broader goal to take greater control over its hardware components, which is expected to improve profit margins and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers. However, this ambition has hit a snag as the anticipated launch for the modems in iPhones will not happen before late 2025.

According to Bloomberg, after the debut of these modems in iPhones, it may take an additional two to three years before they are fully integrated into other products such as iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs. During this transition period, Qualcomm is set to remain a key supplier for Apple and may impose additional charges once their current agreement expires.

Apple is also working on proprietary Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips aimed at decreasing its dependency on Broadcom (NASDAQ: ). However, like its modem development, these efforts have faced setbacks. The integration of custom modems into system-on-a-chip configurations is part of Apple's long-term plan to enhance its product lineup and profitability.

As Apple navigates through these developmental challenges, it underscores the complexities involved in innovating and producing cutting-edge technology components in-house. The company's continued partnership with Qualcomm ensures that Apple can maintain the supply of critical components for its devices while it works towards self-sufficiency in modem production.

Apple is expected to introduce OLED displays on the iPad mini and iPad Air in 2026, following their introduction on both iPad Pro models next year, reports MacRumors.

The news was first reported by Taiwan's ET News. While the iPad Air will keep its 10.9-inch display, the iPad mini's screen will expand from 8.3 to 8.7 inches.

Apple will introduce OLED display technology to the rumoured 12.9-inch iPad Air model in 2027, which is expected to debut with an LCD display early next year, the report mentioned.

Moreover, the tech giant plans to upgrade the iPad Pro's OLED panels in 2027 to a next-generation panel with improved light efficiency via Color Filter on Encapsulation (CoE), which is expected to reduce power consumption by around 20 per cent.

The use of a colour filter may also allow Apple to implement under-display camera technology for the first time on the iPad, according to the report. In addition, the report said that Apple is rumoured to bring OLED to the 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2025, followed by the 14-inch model in 2026.

In 2026, the 13-and 15-inch MacBook Air models will also switch from LCD to OLED. Meanwhile, Apple has announced to support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in later 2024.

In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

He responded to a conspiracy theory that motivated the man who killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.

A White House spokesman said that Musk’s endorsement of the post was ""unacceptable"".

""We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,"" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates was quoted as saying in reports..

""It is unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust,"" Bates added.

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that their point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should stop across the board.

""When it comes to this platform -- X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's no place for it anywhere in the world -- it's ugly and wrong. Full stop,"" she said in an earlier post.

Last week, non-profit Media Matters in its report claimed that as Musk continues his descent into white nationalist and antisemitic conspiracy theories, his social media platform has been placing ads for major brands like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Bravo (NBCUniversal), IBM (NYSE: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Xfinity (Comcast (NASDAQ: )) next to content that supports Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.

The report led to tech and media majors like Apple, IBM, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery, Paramount and Comcast/NBCUniversal reportedly pulling or halting their advertisements, along with Lionsgate and European Commission, on X.

Musk on Saturday said that X will file a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against Media Matters and those who “colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company”.

“Their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them,” he added.

Musk also posted a letter, defending his company and slamming Media Matters report and legacy media organisation.

“Despite our clear and consistent position, X has seen a number of attacks from activist groups like Media Matters and legacy media outlets who seek to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they perceive it as a threat to their ideological narrative and those of their financial supporters,” the letter read.

The letter alleged that these groups try to use their influence to attack “our revenue streams by deceiving advertisers on X”.

“To manipulate the public and advertisers, Media Matters created an alternate account and curated the posts and advertising appearing on the account's timeline to misinform advertisers about the placement of their posts,” the letter argued.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

As a result, investors should ""get the popcorn ready with Fed fears fading,"" the analysts wrote in their note.

""Heading into 2024, we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,"" they said.

Wedbush believes that while IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, cloud and AI-driven spending will be up 20% to 25% over the next year ""with use cases now exploding"" in the enterprise and consumer landscape.

The Wall Street firm also predicts ""a short covering for the ages"" for the tech sector into year-end is on the horizon ""as the fundamental picture for growth tech stocks is rock solid"" based on their recent checks. ""We believe the new tech bull market has now begun, and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 as the AI spending tidal wave hits the shores of the broader tech sector,"" the analysts added.

Furthermore, the analysts said they view AI as ""the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995"" and think many on the Street are underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spending set to happen over the next decade. They described this as a bonanza for the chip and software sectors, looking forward to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and MSFT leading the way.

The firm's favorite tech names remain Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ), Palantir (NYSE: ), Zscaler ( ), CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: ), and MongoDB (NASDAQ: )."
2022-11-17, Investing.com,Apple and Amazon shares surge amid tech market challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-amazon-shares-surge-amid-tech-market-challenges-93CH-3904970,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). are demonstrating remarkable resilience in the face of a challenging technology market, with their shares climbing 44% and 73% respectively. Apple, the consumer electronics giant valued at $2.9 trillion, has managed to limit its revenue decline to just 3% despite an 11% drop in iPhone sales, maintaining a dominant 55% market share in the U.S. smartphone sector. The company's venture into artificial intelligence (AI) areas further bolsters its strong market prospects.

On the other side, Amazon has made a significant turnaround from its previous e-commerce losses, posting an impressive $4 billion in operating income for the recent quarter. This recovery is attributed to strategic cost reductions and layoffs that have helped it navigate economic downturns. Amazon continues to lead in both e-commerce and cloud computing, with AWS maintaining its supremacy in the market.

These industry-leading companies are not only favorites among global shoppers but are also setting records that underscore their technological dominance. As they continue to expand into sectors expected to grow substantially, their positions seem well-poised for future success.

While these two tech titans are thriving, The Motley Fool's Stock Advisor suggests there are ten other stocks that could potentially outperform Apple for investors at this time. However, the current achievements of Apple and Amazon highlight their adaptability and robust performance even as the broader U.S. smartphone market faces difficulties, as reported by Counterpoint Research data.

Both companies' share growth reflects investor confidence and their ability to capitalize on market opportunities despite broader economic pressures. With Apple reaching new peaks in consumer electronics and Amazon showcasing its resilience in e-commerce and cloud services, these firms exemplify enduring strength in the volatile tech industry.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3904586,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."
2022-11-17, Investing.com,Apple's stock performance stalls as tech rivals advance,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-stock-performance-stalls-as-tech-rivals-advance-93CH-3904521,"NEW YORK - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is facing growing investor unease as its stock performance lags behind tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), who are making strides in emergent technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence. Apple's reliance on hardware sales, which include its flagship iPhone and Mac products, has been a cornerstone of its growth strategy. However, this focus is now seen as a potential vulnerability as the company's diversification efforts, through services like iCloud, Apple TV, and Apple Music, are closely linked to its hardware success.

The Cupertino-based tech behemoth has recently reduced order forecasts for new products like the iPhone 15, iPad, and MacBook Air. This move suggests a possible lack of innovation and signals a deceleration in growth—a stark contrast to the sales boom experienced in the post-COVID period. As Apple grapples with maintaining these heightened sales levels without significant investments in cutting-edge technologies or diversification beyond its core hardware and services, the company's stock faces potential headwinds amid a broader economic slowdown.

Despite these challenges, Apple's services sector has demonstrated resilience, expanding by 9% year-over-year in the last quarter even as other areas faltered. This growth underscores the increasing significance of recurring revenue streams for the company. Yet, this bright spot is not without its own challenges; service sales are dependent on hardware volume, meaning that any major downturn in iPhone and Mac sales could impair efforts to bolster services revenue from an otherwise stagnant user base.

While immediate breakthrough technologies from Apple may not be on the horizon, the company is still expected to achieve approximately 10% annual revenue growth over the next decade. In the past ten years, AAPL stock has climbed nearly 28%, and looking ahead, it is anticipated to appreciate by 15-20% annually. For investors considering AAPL stock, the prevailing advice is to remain steadfast through market fluctuations and capitalize on long-term compounding by reinvesting dividends.

Investors are encouraged to look beyond short-term uncertainties and focus on Apple's predictable hardware refresh cycles and high-margin services ecosystem. These factors could provide steady gains over time, even as the market eagerly awaits any new innovations that could reignite Apple's growth trajectory.

2022-11-17, IANS,9 prominent leaders hailing from India named in 'Time 100 Climate' list,https://in.investing.com/news/9-prominent-leaders-hailing-from-india-named-in-time-100-climate-list-3904448,"New York, Nov 17 (IANS) Nine prominent leaders hailing from India have been named to the 'Time 100 Climate', the magazine's first-ever list of the world's most influential leaders driving business to real climate action.The list, which includes CEOs, founders, philanthropists, musicians, policymakers and government officials from across the world, comes ahead of the 2022 UN Climate Change Conference, scheduled to take place in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from November 30.

""It’s fair to say climate leadership is ­embedded across all of our coverage today. But we believe more could be done to draw attention to the people who are shaping and leading climate action,"" Time said, releasing the list on Thursday.

According to Time, Ajay Banga, who began his five-year term as World Bank Group president in June, is ushering in a new mission for the institution -- eradicating poverty while fighting climate change.

Banga is calling for more money to “widen the aperture” of the Bank to structure incentives and loans for projects that lower emissions and advance sustainable development.

He is also pushing to reduce how long it takes to approve projects, so that billions of dollars can quickly reach the countries that need it.

Some 70 per cent of the vehicles on India’s roads are mopeds and scooters, and Bhavish Aggarwal is leading the path to electrifying them.

He is the CEO and co-founder of Ola Electric, India’s largest maker of electric two-wheel scooters, and a market leader in micromobility generally, from taxis to ride-sharing.

This year, Ola launched its most affordable electric scooter ever, priced at Rs 79,999.

Rajiv J. Shah is president of The Rockefeller Foundation, which now works to ensure that all initiatives and investment strategies are focused through a climate lens.

This year, the Foundation partnered with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet to launch the Coal to Clean Credit Initiative. The aim is to develop a new carbon finance standard to spur a just transition away from coal-fired power plants to renewable energy in emerging economies.

Geeta Aiyer is founder and president of Boston Common Asset Management, a woman-led, employee-owned sustainable investment firm with nearly $5 billion in assets under management.

The firm prioritises investment in climate change mitigation, and uses shareholder engagement to push portfolio companies toward more sustainable business practices.

Jigar Shah is director of the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office, which is responsible for the public investment of hundreds of billions of dollars into clean infrastructure and energy projects.

""The solutions to meeting the President’s decarbonisation goals are already within our grasp. It’s a matter of doing rather than waiting for a breakthrough,"" Shah told the Time.

Manoj Sinha is CEO and co-founder of Husk Power Systems, which operates 200 minigrids across Asia and Africa, and reached profitability in India and Nigeria this year.

According to Sinha, the most important climate legislation that could pass in the next year is the imposition of a uniform carbon tax.

M. Sanjayan is a conservation scientist and CEO of Conservation International (CI), a non-profit working with governments and companies to conserve nature, primarily in the Global South.

Sanjayan’s skills as a science communicator have helped CI facilitate powerful partnerships for environmental protection.

The organisation created the Restore Fund in 2021 alongside Apple (NASDAQ: ), which this year pledged $200 million in additional funding to support nature-based carbon removal technologies.

Seema Wadhwa is executive director for environmental stewardship for Kaiser Permanente, one of the largest health care providers in the US.

By 2050, it aims to be net zero.

Under Wadhwa’s leadership, this year Kaiser Permanente’s office in Santa Rosa, California, was recognised as the country’s first net-zero medical facility.

Amit Kumar Sinha is managing director and CEO of Mahindra Lifespaces, the real estate and infrastructure development arm of Indian conglomerate company Mahindra Group.

Since 2013, Mahindra Lifespaces says it has had an entirely green portfolio, prioritizing water efficiency, passive energy design, renewables, and more.

Xi received standing ovations from more than 300 corporate leaders and top officials, including Cook and Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman.

Musk on Friday posted his photo with the Chinese President on X, saying, “May there be prosperity for all”.

The gala dinner was hosted by the US-China Business Council and the National Committee on US-China Relations.

“Whatever stage of development it may reach, China will never pursue hegemony or expansion, and will never impose its will on others,” the President told the gathering.

Earlier, US President Joe Biden told his Chinese counterpart that they should keep their communications lines open and get to understand each other so as “to ensure that competition (between their countries) does not veer into conflict”.

Xi reiterated his opposition to describing the relationship as competition saying it “is not the prevailing trend of current times”.

Biden said that the US is not trying to ""decouple"" from China, but pursuing better relations with its assertive rival.

Xi arrived in San Francisco this week for a summit with Biden, and to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting.

2022-11-17, IANS,"iPhones will support rich communication services in late 2024, confirms Apple",https://in.investing.com/news/iphones-will-support-rich-communication-services-in-late-2024-confirms-apple-3904340,"San Francisco, Nov 17 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) has announced to support the RCS (Rich Communication Services) messaging standard on iPhones, used by most Android devices, in later 2024.In a statement to 9to5Mac, the tech giant said that RCS will offer better interoperability for cross-platform messages.

“Later next year, we will be adding support for RCS Universal Profile, the standard as currently published by the GSM Association. We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,” an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying.

This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users, said the company.

Apple’s decision came amid pressure from regulators, like European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), and competitors like Google (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). RCS brings iMessage-style features to cross-platform texts.

The iPhone adopting RCS could enable support for encryption, read receipts, typing indicators, high-res images and videos while sending texts between iPhone and Android devices.

Apple will let users share locations in text threads and RCS messages will be green, like SMS messages.

However, Apple is not opening up iMessage to other platforms but instead replace SMS and MMS and “exist separately from iMessage when available.”

In September, the European Commission opened up an investigation into iMessage to determine whether it should be considered a “core platform service.”

Apple argued iMessage isn’t popular enough in Europe for the rules to apply.

Google and Samsung have been pushing for Apple to add support for RCS.

“Everybody should have secure and modern messaging without worrying what kind of phone they’re texting to. So glad to see Apple joining our ongoing work with the GSMA on RCS to make texting better for all,” ,” Google SVP of platforms and ecosystems, Hiroshi Lockheimer, posted on X.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Apple to support RCS messaging, boosting Android interoperability",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-support-rcs-messaging-boosting-android-interoperability-93CH-3904322,"CUPERTINO - In a strategic pivot, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced its plan to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) Universal Profile, a messaging standard widely used by Android devices, including those from tech rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (KS: ). This move marks a significant shift from Apple's previous stance on messaging interoperability and comes as the company faces regulatory pressure from the European Union's Digital Markets Act.

The integration of RCS into iPhones, starting with the iPhone 15 series, is expected to enhance user experience by improving cross-platform messaging capabilities. RCS is set to replace traditional SMS and MMS services, offering a richer communication experience akin to Apple's own iMessage platform. While iMessage is known for its robust privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, RCS does not currently offer the same level of security. Nevertheless, Apple is committed to maintaining user privacy and continues to promote iMessage as its premier messaging service due to its superior security measures.

The announcement on Thursday aligns with the appeal deadline for the EU's Digital Markets Act, which mandates service interoperability among large technology firms. In 2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook dismissed the idea of adopting cross-platform RCS, advocating instead for consumers to purchase iPhones to enjoy exclusive iMessage features. However, this policy change indicates a more collaborative approach to messaging standards and could potentially reshape how iPhone users communicate with Android users.

By supporting RCS Universal Profile, Apple is taking steps toward creating a more unified messaging ecosystem that transcends device boundaries while attempting to uphold its commitment to user privacy and security.

These companies are expected to continue leading the market into the next year due to their ability to reinvest and drive superior financial results.

Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, has identified these tech giants as critical players in the stock market. They are often referred to by financial acronyms and are benchmarked against a specific index to track their collective performance.

In the backdrop of a resilient economy with a robust labor market and cooling inflation, Goldman Sachs offers an optimistic outlook. The unemployment rate was recorded at 3.9% in October, with a year-on-year price increase standing at 3.2%. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasts a GDP growth of 2.4% for 2022 and expects similar growth of 2.1% in 2024.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is anticipated to shift towards gradual rate cuts in the second half of 2024, with Hatzius assigning a 15% chance of recession within the next 12 months. The is projected to see moderate growth, ending at 4,700 next year, marking a 5% increase.

Kostin recommends focusing on quality stocks as a high-conviction investment approach and predicts modest earnings growth of 5% for both 2024 and 2025. Profit margins are likely to maintain stability during this period. The normalization of supply-demand imbalances that arose during the COVID pandemic has contributed to lower inflation while sustaining satisfactory GDP growth. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18; however, on an equal-weighted basis, this ratio drops to 14.

This financial assessment by Goldman Sachs underscores the enduring strength and potential resilience of these leading tech companies amidst economic uncertainties.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Tech sector defies rate hikes with AI-driven surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-defies-rate-hikes-with-aidriven-surge-93CH-3903947,"NEW YORK - The tech sector has demonstrated remarkable tenacity in 2022, rallying impressively despite the Federal Reserve's significant interest rate increases. This year, the S&P 500’s Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) experienced a substantial 46.5% boost as of November 15, primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The Federal Reserve has been on a campaign to tighten monetary policy, raising interest rates by a total of 525 basis points since March 2022. The current benchmark interest rate sits between 5.25% and 5.5%. Historically, such hikes tend to dampen growth in sectors like technology due to increased borrowing costs. However, tech stocks have shown a surprising ability to bounce back from periodic dips. This resilience is highlighted by the 's impressive year-to-year climb of 34.8%.

Major players in the tech industry, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have played a pivotal role in the S&P 500’s overall rise of 17.3% year to date.

The momentum for tech stocks saw a resurgence in November following the Federal Reserve's decision during its last FOMC meeting to maintain interest rates for the second time in a row.

Investors are now optimistic as expectations mount over cooling inflation, suggesting that the central bank may pivot away from its current hawkish stance and potentially start reducing interest rates in 2024. This anticipated shift is seen as beneficial for the tech sector.

In light of these developments, certain tech sector funds are gaining attention for their strong performance and investment potential. Funds such as the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (NASDAQ:FSELX), Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund (NASDAQ:SLMCX), and T. Rowe Price Science & Tech Fund (NASDAQ:PRSCX) come highly recommended due to their impressive track records. These funds also boast strong Zacks Mutual Fund rankings, are accessible with reasonable minimum initial investment amounts, and offer competitive low expense ratios, making them attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's robust performance amidst a challenging economic environment shaped by high interest rates.

U.S. stock futures edged lower on Thursday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, following a positive close in the prior session.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, shed 3 points or 0.1%, and lost 31 points or 0.2%.

The main indices on Wall Street ended Wednesday in the green, fueled in part by the largest monthly drop in wholesale prices since 2020 in October. The figure, which came a day after data showed that consumer prices grew at a slower-than-anticipated rate last month, added to optimism that the Federal Reserve's long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.

At the closing bell, the 30-stock had gained 0.5%, the benchmark had risen by 0.2%, and the tech-heavy had climbed by 0.1%.

2. Walmart earnings ahead

Walmart is set to deliver its latest quarterly results on Thursday, with investors keen for more details on how the retail giant sees trading evolving heading into the key holiday shopping season.

Total U.S. comparable sales, excluding gasoline, are estimated to rise by 3.35% in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings per share are seen at $1.52, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Meanwhile, the company is projected to forecast adjusted income per share of $1.66 in its current quarter, up from $1.53 in the corresponding period last year. Analysts will also likely want to hear more about the holiday outlook from Walmart executives, particularly after comments from rival Target on Wednesday pointed to lingering pressures on U.S. consumers from trends like higher interest rates and lower savings despite signs of easing inflation.

Unlike some of its big-box peers, Walmart has largely been able to weather a downturn in spending on big-ticket items by leaning on its reputation for offering low costs on essentials like groceries. Same-store sales in the U.S. jumped by 6.4% in the second quarter, topping expectations, while its international unit posted its best three-month performance since at least 2016.

3. Biden and Xi meet face-to-face

U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to re-establish military communications following a crucial face-to-face meeting on Wednesday.

The two leaders spoke for roughly four hours at a time when tensions between both sides over a range of issues have been perceived to be high. It was only the second time that Biden has spoken in-person with Xi since taking office in 2021.

Following the gathering, Biden said that China had agreed to return to ""direct, open, clear"" communication, which had been closed since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. U.S. officials have speculated on when China may attempt to invade Taiwan, which it claims as a part of its territory, although Xi reportedly denied that any such plans were in place.

However, a senior U.S. official told Reuters that Xi said the status of the island is the ""most potentially dangerous issue"" facing U.S.-China ties. Biden stressed to Xi that Washington wanted to see ""peace and stability"" in the region, Reuters added, citing the official.

Later on Wednesday, Xi told a room full of some of America's leading corporate figures -- including Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Elon Musk and Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Tim Cook -- that China and its ""super-large economy"" are ready to ""be a partner and friend of the U.S.""

4. Senate passes stop-gap spending measure

The U.S. Senate has voted in favor of a stop-gap plan that will likely avoid a partial government shutdown.

Following a tally of 87-11 in the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress, the measure, which was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week, now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described the outcome of talks over the short-term spending proposal ""a great outcome for the American people"" that will avert cuts to ""vital"" federal programs.

The bill received wide backing from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, marking a shift away from the political brinkmanship seen in recent debates over government spending plans. But it remains uncertain if the detente will also be seen when a fresh funding deadline arrives early next year.

Political battles have already exacerbated concerns on Wall Street over America's fiscal condition, with Moody's (NYSE: ) last week citing polarization in Washington as one of the reasons for its decision to lower its U.S. credit rating outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

5. Oil slips following jump in U.S. inventories

Oil prices retreated Thursday after U.S. inventories rose by more than expected, adding to concerns over lackluster energy demand from China.

By 05:01 ET, the futures traded 0.2% lower at $76.53 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $80.88 per barrel.

U.S. crude stocks increased by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 10, above expectations for a build of nearly 1.8 million barrels, according to data released late Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Figures also showed that U.S. production remained at record highs of 13.2 million barrels per day through the week."

2022-11-15, Investing.com,BlackRock warns of low thematic growth exposure in U.S. portfolios,https://in.investing.com/news/blackrock-warns-of-low-thematic-growth-exposure-in-us-portfolios-93CH-3902798,"NEW YORK - BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning to investors regarding the perceived adequacy of their thematic growth exposure through major technology stocks. Jay Jacobs, a senior executive at BlackRock, highlighted that many U.S. wealth investors might be underestimating their portfolios' actual exposure to transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), medical innovation, and the changing landscape of globalization.

According to BlackRock's 2024 Thematic Outlook Report, most investments in AI come from the large-cap tech firms known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ). However, the report underscores that no theme has more than 1.5% pure-play exposure, suggesting that investors relying solely on these megacap stocks may not have significant investment in these key areas.

To better capture the next wave of growth in AI, Jacobs recommends diversifying into specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA: IRBO) are noted for their potential to tap into AI advancements. Jacobs predicts that significant growth opportunities will arise within small and mid-cap companies in this space. Additionally, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IHAK) is identified as being closely tied to the AI theme.

In terms of globalization trends, Jacobs points out that Mexico has recently surpassed China and Canada to become the largest trade partner with the United States. To capitalize on this shift, he suggests considering investments in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW) and the iShares MSCI India ETF (NYSEARCA: INDA).

The medical innovation sector is also undergoing significant changes due to demographic shifts in the U.S., with the population hitting ""peak 65"" and experiencing what BlackRock calls a 'Historical Reversal'. To engage with this theme, BlackRock has identified several funds including the BlackRock Future Health ETF (BMED), iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF (NASDAQ: IBRN).

Investors are being urged to reassess their portfolios to ensure they are not overlooking opportunities for thematic growth beyond the dominant tech giants. By considering a broader range of targeted ETFs, they may be able to achieve a more robust exposure to these burgeoning sectors.

2022-11-15, IANS,Apple extends Emergency SOS via satellite for another free year,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-extends-emergency-sos-via-satellite-for-another-free-year-3902488,"San Francisco, Nov 15 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday announced it is extending free access to Emergency SOS via satellite feature for an additional year for existing iPhone 14 users.

The company launched that groundbreaking safety service one year ago on all iPhone 14 models in the US and Canada. It is now also available on the iPhone 15 lineup in 16 countries and regions.

This technology enables users to text with emergency services while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage and has already made a significant impact, contributing to many lives being saved.

""Emergency SOS via satellite has helped save lives around the world,"" Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing, said in a statement.

""From a man who was rescued after his car plummeted over a 400-foot cliff in Los Angeles, to lost hikers found in the Apennine Mountains in Italy, we continue to hear stories of our customers being able to connect with emergency responders when they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to,"" she added.

Building on this satellite infrastructure, Apple recently introduced Roadside Assistance via satellite to connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.

Roadside Assistance via satellite is available in the US and is included for free for two years, starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max. This satellite service requires iOS 17.

2022-11-15, IANS,Nothing's iMessage hack for you to chat via Android comes with some red flags,https://in.investing.com/news/nothings-imessage-hack-for-you-to-chat-via-android-comes-with-some-red-flags-3902424,"San Francisco, Nov 15 (IANS) Global consumer electronics brand Nothing, which added Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iMessage functionality to Android Phone (2) via a new “Nothing Chats” app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird, comes with some red flags.

Sunbird will offer support for iMessage service, allowing users of Nothing's flagship phone to text iPhone users as if they were on an iPhone themselves, appearing as a blue bubble. Nothing Chats will also support texting to other Android phones via RCS, in addition to SMS and MMS.

The app will be available to download from the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store, and will initially be available in the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries starting November 17.

While little is known about the Sunbird app, it promises to make this app available for free to all users.

On downloading the app, users will need to log in to Nothing Chats with an Apple ID username or create one if they don't have one, according to CNET.

Even though Nothing promises that neither it nor Sunbird will store any of your message data or Apple ID information, it should be noted that users will be initially entering their login details that might also be tied to other Apple services.

According to a Nothing representative, these details are tokenised by Sunbird, used to set up a relay with one of Sunbird's Mac Mini computers that make the connection to iMessage and after setup are destroyed by Sunbird.

After that, users will need to set Nothing Chats as their default messaging app to start sending and receiving iMessage chats from iPhone users alongside texts from Android devices.

Another thing that needs to be noted here is that iMessage texts users send will use the email address attached to their Apple ID instead of their phone number. It's similar to using iMessage from an iPad or Mac computer when they don't otherwise have an iPhone.

According to the report, Nothing plans to build phone number compatibility in a future update.

For now, users' texts may appear to come from an email address rather than their phone number, but whoever they text can fix this by including their Apple ID email address in their contact information on their phone.

Nothing Chats isn't the first service to provide a workaround for Android phones using iMessage.

Beeper, which is also in beta, aims to give users access to iMessage and other chat apps. AirMessage employs a self-hosted model in which it is installed directly on a Mac that must be kept running at all times, with messages forwarded to an Android phone, the report mentioned.

These methods allow Android phones to send and receive iMessage texts, but they come with their own set of security risks and are unlikely to maintain feature parity as Apple updates its official iMessage service with new features.

Nothing's iMessage access, which is being developed independently of Apple, may also lag behind any new iMessage features that Apple adds to iOS.

An attorney for Epic asked Pichai if the detail presented by Google’s witness was accurate.

“That’s correct,” Pichai responded.

About the Samsung (KS: ) deal, Pichai told the court that “it’s like apples and oranges”.

The Google CEO added that the deals sometimes pay carriers.

He later said that Google competes “fiercely with Apple.”

“The attorney for Epic also asked Pichai about the exact dollar amount it pays to Apple, to which Pichai said it was over $10 billion. But the attorney pushed back, contending the figure is actually $18 billion,” the report mentioned.

Apart from Epic Games, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is facing two separate US Justice Department lawsuits related to alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant had earlier told the court.

This technical indicator is often used to gauge market momentum and potential reversals in asset prices, suggesting that Bitcoin could be facing further downward pressure.

As traditional markets respond positively to the latest economic data, the cryptocurrency market appears to be charting its own course. Investors will be closely monitoring whether Bitcoin can hold the $35,500 level or if it will succumb to bearish trends amidst broader market gains.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google defends against antitrust accusations citing innovation and competition,https://in.investing.com/news/google-defends-against-antitrust-accusations-citing-innovation-and-competition-93CH-3901834,"WASHINGTON - Google (NASDAQ: ) is nearing the end of its defense in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit, with the U.S. et al. v. Google case set to conclude after a final government rebuttal. The tech giant has been contending with allegations from the Justice Department and state attorneys general that it holds a monopoly over search and advertising markets.

During the proceedings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood by the company's practice of paying for default search engine status on devices from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms, revealing that Google shared 36% of search revenue from these deals with Apple. Kevin Murphy, an economic expert for Google, provided testimony to support this claim.

Google's defense also pointed to instances where competition influenced market decisions, such as Mozilla's temporary shift from Google to Yahoo in 2014 due to product quality issues, only to return to Google in 2017 following a decline in Yahoo’s user experience.

Prabhakar Raghavan, head of search at Google, emphasized the firm's dedication to advancing technology through significant research and development investments. This commitment was contrasted with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella's vague responses regarding Microsoft's investment in its own search engine Bing during cross-examination.

The government has accused Google of several anti-competitive behaviors, including delaying the launch of generative AI technology until after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT and considering an incognito search engine that would not store user data—a move that could have potentially cost the company billions in revenue. Additionally, the government alleged that Google manipulated ad prices during times of revenue shortfall.

In response, Google cited its long history of fostering competition by introducing transformative products such as its search engine in 1998, the Chrome browser in 2008, and the Android operating system in 2008. The company also highlighted its competition with newer entrants like TikTok and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which have become alternative sources of online information.

The outcome of this landmark case rests with Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is expected to issue a verdict next year. The decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader tech industry as debates over antitrust laws and digital market dominance continue.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Barclays anticipates Google defeat in antitrust case, stock rises",https://in.investing.com/news/barclays-anticipates-google-defeat-in-antitrust-case-stock-rises-93CH-3901779,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is currently navigating through a challenging antitrust lawsuit. Despite a prediction from Barclays (LON: ) that the tech giant may face a defeat in the U.S. antitrust case, Alphabet's shares experienced an unexpected rise, increasing by 1.5% today. This legal battle has been brought into sharper focus following expert testimony on Monday that disclosed Google derives a significant 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari users.

The spotlight on Google's revenue-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) could provide leverage to regulatory authorities like the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The authority may consider enforcing measures similar to those used in Europe, such as ""choice screens"" for search engines and limits on revenue sharing. These measures have been implemented on some Android devices in Europe but have had limited impact on Alphabet's market valuation.

Despite these challenges, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on Alphabet's financial prospects.

The case against Google has been gaining momentum since earlier in November 2022, when Barclays raised concerns about the formidable case built by the U.S. Justice Department. The unique market dynamics of iOS devices in the U.S., which are due to evolve in 2024, could exacerbate the impact if Google were to lose this legal dispute. This outcome could lead Apple to consider alternatives for its search service, potentially partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing or developing its own search engine.

With the continued proliferation of 5G, “we anticipate an increasingly dynamic and seamless user experience across a diverse range of applications and services,” Kumari added.

The overall tablet market in India is expected to experience single-digit YoY growth in 2022.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Huawei's China sales up 83% in October as Mate 60 Pro continues to rival iPhone 15,https://in.investing.com/news/huaweis-china-sales-up-83-in-october-as-mate-60-pro-continues-to-rival-iphone-15-432SI-3901357,"Huawei, the consumer electronics company from China, saw its annual sales rise as much as 83% in the first four weeks of October, according to the data from research firm Counterpoint.

Overall, China experienced an 11% rise in total smartphone shipments, fueled by strong sales growth at Huawei. Xiaomi (OTC: ) also saw a notable increase in smartphone sales, with a 33% rise.

Huawei's turnaround is attributed to the success of its Mate 60 smartphone series, launched in August and powered by a self-developed high-end chip. Mate 60 Pro is seen as a direct rival of Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 15 Max Pro.

While Counterpoint acknowledged Huawei's stellar performance, it notes the possibility of lingering bottlenecks and production issues for the company."
2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google wraps up defense in major antitrust lawsuit,https://in.investing.com/news/google-wraps-up-defense-in-major-antitrust-lawsuit-93CH-3901346,"Google (NASDAQ: ) has concluded its defense in a significant antitrust case heard by Judge Amit P. Mehta at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where it stands accused by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general of illegally monopolizing the search and advertising markets. A decision in the case is expected sometime in 2024.

In today's final arguments, Google's defense hinged on three primary points: the rationale behind its business strategies, evidence of robust competition in the search market, and its positive influence on consumers and overall market competition.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand to justify the company's financial dealings with Apple (NASDAQ: ), explaining that paying for default search engine status on Apple devices was a strategic move meant to boost search usage and revenue. In 2021, Google invested a substantial $26.3 billion to secure its position as the default search engine across various platforms, dedicating $18 billion of that amount to Apple alone.

Addressing claims of monopolistic behavior, Google's legal team pointed to instances of competition within the search engine space. They highlighted Mozilla's temporary adoption of Yahoo as their default search engine in 2014, which ultimately reverted back following user feedback, as an example that other players have had opportunities to enter and compete in the market.

Prabhakar Raghavan, Google’s head of search, emphasized the company's hefty $40 billion investment in research and development over the past year. He stated that such investments have allowed Google to deliver superior technology and services to users. Furthermore, Google argued that its entrance into various markets has actually stimulated more competition rather than stifling it.

The case against Google has been closely watched as it touches on broader concerns about the power wielded by tech giants and their influence on consumer choices and market dynamics. As both sides await a verdict next year, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how digital markets are regulated and how tech companies operate globally.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Google antitrust trial mirrors Microsoft case, nearing conclusion",https://in.investing.com/news/google-antitrust-trial-mirrors-microsoft-case-nearing-conclusion-93CH-3901280,"The high-profile antitrust trial involving tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which commenced in September, is approaching its final stages, with expectations to conclude around Thanksgiving. The legal battle has seen Google defending itself against accusations that it has established an unassailable market position in the search engine sector, similar to the monopoly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) held over PC software in the 1990s.

The prosecution, comprising the Justice Department along with several states, asserts that Google's dominance is built upon user-generated data, creating a significant barrier to entry for any would-be competitors. This narrative draws parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft over two decades ago. In response, Google's defense attorney John Schmidtlein has emphasized the diminishing impact of data accumulation and credits Google's leading position to their substantial investment in human resources and software development.

Central to the case are Google's pay-for-default agreements with major technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). These deals have been flagged by Judge Amit P. Mehta as the ""heart of the case,"" indicating their potential influence on the trial's outcome.

As the proceedings advanced into October, Schmidtlein sought to distinguish Google's circumstances from those of Microsoft by suggesting that barriers to competition in today's search market are less insurmountable than what was seen with personal computer software in the '90s. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this line of reasoning, maintaining his stance on using the Microsoft litigation as a benchmark for this trial.

With a verdict on the horizon, discussions around possible remedies have come into focus. Google maintains that it operates within a fair competitive landscape, while government officials are advocating for stringent sanctions to counteract the company's alleged anticompetitive practices.

The trial's outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader technology industry, particularly concerning how digital markets and user data are regulated. As closing arguments near, all eyes are on Judge Mehta's decision and its potential to reshape the landscape of tech monopolies.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs highlights seven tech giants as market leaders,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-highlights-seven-tech-giants-as-market-leaders-93CH-3904267,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) has spotlighted a group of seven technology stocks, known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), for their standout financial performance and strong balance sheets. These companies are expected to continue leading the market into the next year due to their ability to reinvest and drive superior financial results.

Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, has identified these tech giants as critical players in the stock market. They are often referred to by financial acronyms and are benchmarked against a specific index to track their collective performance.

In the backdrop of a resilient economy with a robust labor market and cooling inflation, Goldman Sachs offers an optimistic outlook. The unemployment rate was recorded at 3.9% in October, with a year-on-year price increase standing at 3.2%. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasts a GDP growth of 2.4% for 2022 and expects similar growth of 2.1% in 2024.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is anticipated to shift towards gradual rate cuts in the second half of 2024, with Hatzius assigning a 15% chance of recession within the next 12 months. The is projected to see moderate growth, ending at 4,700 next year, marking a 5% increase.

Kostin recommends focusing on quality stocks as a high-conviction investment approach and predicts modest earnings growth of 5% for both 2024 and 2025. Profit margins are likely to maintain stability during this period. The normalization of supply-demand imbalances that arose during the COVID pandemic has contributed to lower inflation while sustaining satisfactory GDP growth. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18; however, on an equal-weighted basis, this ratio drops to 14.

This financial assessment by Goldman Sachs underscores the enduring strength and potential resilience of these leading tech companies amidst economic uncertainties.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Tech sector defies rate hikes with AI-driven surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-defies-rate-hikes-with-aidriven-surge-93CH-3903947,"NEW YORK - The tech sector has demonstrated remarkable tenacity in 2022, rallying impressively despite the Federal Reserve's significant interest rate increases. This year, the S&P 500’s Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) experienced a substantial 46.5% boost as of November 15, primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The Federal Reserve has been on a campaign to tighten monetary policy, raising interest rates by a total of 525 basis points since March 2022. The current benchmark interest rate sits between 5.25% and 5.5%. Historically, such hikes tend to dampen growth in sectors like technology due to increased borrowing costs. However, tech stocks have shown a surprising ability to bounce back from periodic dips. This resilience is highlighted by the 's impressive year-to-year climb of 34.8%.

Major players in the tech industry, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have played a pivotal role in the S&P 500’s overall rise of 17.3% year to date.

The momentum for tech stocks saw a resurgence in November following the Federal Reserve's decision during its last FOMC meeting to maintain interest rates for the second time in a row.

Investors are now optimistic as expectations mount over cooling inflation, suggesting that the central bank may pivot away from its current hawkish stance and potentially start reducing interest rates in 2024. This anticipated shift is seen as beneficial for the tech sector.

In light of these developments, certain tech sector funds are gaining attention for their strong performance and investment potential. Funds such as the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (NASDAQ:FSELX), Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund (NASDAQ:SLMCX), and T. Rowe Price Science & Tech Fund (NASDAQ:PRSCX) come highly recommended due to their impressive track records. These funds also boast strong Zacks Mutual Fund rankings, are accessible with reasonable minimum initial investment amounts, and offer competitive low expense ratios, making them attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's robust performance amidst a challenging economic environment shaped by high interest rates.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,"Walmart to report, Biden-Xi meeting - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/walmart-to-report-bidenxi-meeting--whats-moving-markets-3903493,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch broadly lower on Thursday after a positive session on Wall Street, while traders look ahead to retail chain Walmart's (NYSE: ) forecast for the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agree to re-open military communications after a crucial face-to-face meeting, and the U.S. Senate approves a stop-gap spending bill that will almost certainly avert a looming partial government shutdown.

1. Futures point broadly lower

U.S. stock futures edged lower on Thursday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, following a positive close in the prior session.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, shed 3 points or 0.1%, and lost 31 points or 0.2%.

The main indices on Wall Street ended Wednesday in the green, fueled in part by the largest monthly drop in wholesale prices since 2020 in October. The figure, which came a day after data showed that consumer prices grew at a slower-than-anticipated rate last month, added to optimism that the Federal Reserve's long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.

At the closing bell, the 30-stock had gained 0.5%, the benchmark had risen by 0.2%, and the tech-heavy had climbed by 0.1%.

2. Walmart earnings ahead

Walmart is set to deliver its latest quarterly results on Thursday, with investors keen for more details on how the retail giant sees trading evolving heading into the key holiday shopping season.

Total U.S. comparable sales, excluding gasoline, are estimated to rise by 3.35% in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings per share are seen at $1.52, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

Meanwhile, the company is projected to forecast adjusted income per share of $1.66 in its current quarter, up from $1.53 in the corresponding period last year. Analysts will also likely want to hear more about the holiday outlook from Walmart executives, particularly after comments from rival Target on Wednesday pointed to lingering pressures on U.S. consumers from trends like higher interest rates and lower savings despite signs of easing inflation.

Unlike some of its big-box peers, Walmart has largely been able to weather a downturn in spending on big-ticket items by leaning on its reputation for offering low costs on essentials like groceries. Same-store sales in the U.S. jumped by 6.4% in the second quarter, topping expectations, while its international unit posted its best three-month performance since at least 2016.

3. Biden and Xi meet face-to-face

U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to re-establish military communications following a crucial face-to-face meeting on Wednesday.

The two leaders spoke for roughly four hours at a time when tensions between both sides over a range of issues have been perceived to be high. It was only the second time that Biden has spoken in-person with Xi since taking office in 2021.

Following the gathering, Biden said that China had agreed to return to ""direct, open, clear"" communication, which had been closed since former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022. U.S. officials have speculated on when China may attempt to invade Taiwan, which it claims as a part of its territory, although Xi reportedly denied that any such plans were in place.

However, a senior U.S. official told Reuters that Xi said the status of the island is the ""most potentially dangerous issue"" facing U.S.-China ties. Biden stressed to Xi that Washington wanted to see ""peace and stability"" in the region, Reuters added, citing the official.

Later on Wednesday, Xi told a room full of some of America's leading corporate figures -- including Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Elon Musk and Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Tim Cook -- that China and its ""super-large economy"" are ready to ""be a partner and friend of the U.S.""

4. Senate passes stop-gap spending measure

The U.S. Senate has voted in favor of a stop-gap plan that will likely avoid a partial government shutdown.

Following a tally of 87-11 in the upper chamber of the U.S. Congress, the measure, which was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week, now heads to President Biden's desk for his signature.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described the outcome of talks over the short-term spending proposal ""a great outcome for the American people"" that will avert cuts to ""vital"" federal programs.

The bill received wide backing from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, marking a shift away from the political brinkmanship seen in recent debates over government spending plans. But it remains uncertain if the detente will also be seen when a fresh funding deadline arrives early next year.

Political battles have already exacerbated concerns on Wall Street over America's fiscal condition, with Moody's (NYSE: ) last week citing polarization in Washington as one of the reasons for its decision to lower its U.S. credit rating outlook to ""negative"" from ""stable.""

5. Oil slips following jump in U.S. inventories

Oil prices retreated Thursday after U.S. inventories rose by more than expected, adding to concerns over lackluster energy demand from China.

By 05:01 ET, the futures traded 0.2% lower at $76.53 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $80.88 per barrel.

U.S. crude stocks increased by 3.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 10, above expectations for a build of nearly 1.8 million barrels, according to data released late Wednesday by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Figures also showed that U.S. production remained at record highs of 13.2 million barrels per day through the week."

The event, part of Xi's efforts to attract foreign investment and strengthen China's economy, also sees CEOs from influential companies such as Blackstone (NYSE: ), Visa (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) in attendance.

The dinner follows a significant afternoon of talks between President Xi and President Joe Biden during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meetings, signaling a step towards mending the tense US-China bilateral relationship. Amid growing concerns over China's stringent national security policies and the portrayal of foreign entities as espionage threats, the engagement with Xi is seen as vital by businesses invested in the vast Chinese consumer electronics market.

The National Committee on U.S.–China Relations and the US-China Business Council are hosting the private dinner. Details of the event have been kept under wraps; however, Mike Gallagher, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, revealed at an anti-CCP rally that seats at Xi's table commanded a price of $40,000 each.

In addition to the American corporate titans, Xi's ""old friends"" from Iowa, who hosted him during a visit 38 years ago, are also expected to join the dinner. The Chinese leader is set to address the attendees, further underscoring the importance of this diplomatic and economic outreach initiative.

The decline in Meta's share value contrasts with its recent strong performance that had propelled the stock near its yearly peak. It remains to be seen if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more sustained shift in investor sentiment towards the company.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,BlackRock warns of low thematic growth exposure in U.S. portfolios,https://in.investing.com/news/blackrock-warns-of-low-thematic-growth-exposure-in-us-portfolios-93CH-3902798,"NEW YORK - BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning to investors regarding the perceived adequacy of their thematic growth exposure through major technology stocks. Jay Jacobs, a senior executive at BlackRock, highlighted that many U.S. wealth investors might be underestimating their portfolios' actual exposure to transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), medical innovation, and the changing landscape of globalization.

According to BlackRock's 2024 Thematic Outlook Report, most investments in AI come from the large-cap tech firms known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ). However, the report underscores that no theme has more than 1.5% pure-play exposure, suggesting that investors relying solely on these megacap stocks may not have significant investment in these key areas.

To better capture the next wave of growth in AI, Jacobs recommends diversifying into specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA: IRBO) are noted for their potential to tap into AI advancements. Jacobs predicts that significant growth opportunities will arise within small and mid-cap companies in this space. Additionally, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IHAK) is identified as being closely tied to the AI theme.

In terms of globalization trends, Jacobs points out that Mexico has recently surpassed China and Canada to become the largest trade partner with the United States. To capitalize on this shift, he suggests considering investments in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW) and the iShares MSCI India ETF (NYSEARCA: INDA).

The medical innovation sector is also undergoing significant changes due to demographic shifts in the U.S., with the population hitting ""peak 65"" and experiencing what BlackRock calls a 'Historical Reversal'. To engage with this theme, BlackRock has identified several funds including the BlackRock Future Health ETF (BMED), iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF (NASDAQ: IBRN).

Investors are being urged to reassess their portfolios to ensure they are not overlooking opportunities for thematic growth beyond the dominant tech giants. By considering a broader range of targeted ETFs, they may be able to achieve a more robust exposure to these burgeoning sectors.

The company launched that groundbreaking safety service one year ago on all iPhone 14 models in the US and Canada. It is now also available on the iPhone 15 lineup in 16 countries and regions.

This technology enables users to text with emergency services while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage and has already made a significant impact, contributing to many lives being saved.

""Emergency SOS via satellite has helped save lives around the world,"" Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing, said in a statement.

""From a man who was rescued after his car plummeted over a 400-foot cliff in Los Angeles, to lost hikers found in the Apennine Mountains in Italy, we continue to hear stories of our customers being able to connect with emergency responders when they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to,"" she added.

Building on this satellite infrastructure, Apple recently introduced Roadside Assistance via satellite to connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.

Roadside Assistance via satellite is available in the US and is included for free for two years, starting at the time of activation of a new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max.

2022-11-15, IANS,Nothing's iMessage hack for you to chat via Android comes with some red flags,https://in.investing.com/news/nothings-imessage-hack-for-you-to-chat-via-android-comes-with-some-red-flags-3902424,"San Francisco, Nov 15 (IANS) Global consumer electronics brand Nothing, which added Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iMessage functionality to Android Phone (2) via a new “Nothing Chats” app powered by the messaging platform Sunbird, comes with some red flags.

Sunbird will offer support for iMessage service, allowing users of Nothing's flagship phone to text iPhone users as if they were on an iPhone themselves, appearing as a blue bubble. Nothing Chats will also support texting to other Android phones via RCS, in addition to SMS and MMS.

The app will be available to download from the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store, and will initially be available in the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries starting November 17.

While little is known about the Sunbird app, it promises to make this app available for free to all users.

On downloading the app, users will need to log in to Nothing Chats with an Apple ID username or create one if they don't have one, according to CNET.

Even though Nothing promises that neither it nor Sunbird will store any of your message data or Apple ID information, it should be noted that users will be initially entering their login details that might also be tied to other Apple services.

According to a Nothing representative, these details are tokenised by Sunbird, used to set up a relay with one of Sunbird's Mac Mini computers that make the connection to iMessage and after setup are destroyed by Sunbird.

After that, users will need to set Nothing Chats as their default messaging app to start sending and receiving iMessage chats from iPhone users alongside texts from Android devices.

Another thing that needs to be noted here is that iMessage texts users send will use the email address attached to their Apple ID instead of their phone number. It's similar to using iMessage from an iPad or Mac computer when they don't otherwise have an iPhone.

According to the report, Nothing plans to build phone number compatibility in a future update.

For now, users' texts may appear to come from an email address rather than their phone number, but whoever they text can fix this by including their Apple ID email address in their contact information on their phone.

Nothing Chats isn't the first service to provide a workaround for Android phones using iMessage.

Beeper, which is also in beta, aims to give users access to iMessage and other chat apps. AirMessage employs a self-hosted model in which it is installed directly on a Mac that must be kept running at all times, with messages forwarded to an Android phone, the report mentioned.

These methods allow Android phones to send and receive iMessage texts, but they come with their own set of security risks and are unlikely to maintain feature parity as Apple updates its official iMessage service with new features.

Nothing's iMessage access, which is being developed independently of Apple, may also lag behind any new iMessage features that Apple adds to iOS.

An attorney for Epic asked Pichai if the detail presented by Google’s witness was accurate.

“That’s correct,” Pichai responded.

About the Samsung (KS: ) deal, Pichai told the court that “it’s like apples and oranges”.

The Google CEO added that the deals sometimes pay carriers.

He later said that Google competes “fiercely with Apple.”

“The attorney for Epic also asked Pichai about the exact dollar amount it pays to Apple, to which Pichai said it was over $10 billion. But the attorney pushed back, contending the figure is actually $18 billion,” the report mentioned.

Apart from Epic Games, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is facing two separate US Justice Department lawsuits related to alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant had earlier told the court.

Google has been defending its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

Despite the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for October surpassing expectations and sparking a rally, the leading cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain its upward momentum.

The positive inflation news had a markedly different impact on U.S. stock markets, which saw an infusion of over $700 billion in value. Tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) were among the major stocks that benefited from the growth, highlighting a divergence in market dynamics.

Bitcoin's challenges in staging a recovery are seen by some investors as an indication of a potential shift in trend. This comes even as Bitcoin shows moderate correlations with major indices, recording correlations of 0.25 and 0.33 with the and respectively. However, most of the market inflows have been concentrated outside the cryptocurrency sector.

Adding to concerns for Bitcoin investors is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which is signaling a bearish crossover. This technical indicator is often used to gauge market momentum and potential reversals in asset prices, suggesting that Bitcoin could be facing further downward pressure.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google defends against antitrust accusations citing innovation and competition,https://in.investing.com/news/google-defends-against-antitrust-accusations-citing-innovation-and-competition-93CH-3901834,"WASHINGTON - Google (NASDAQ: ) is nearing the end of its defense in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit, with the U.S. et al. v. Google case set to conclude after a final government rebuttal. The tech giant has been contending with allegations from the Justice Department and state attorneys general that it holds a monopoly over search and advertising markets.

During the proceedings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood by the company's practice of paying for default search engine status on devices from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms, revealing that Google shared 36% of search revenue from these deals with Apple. Kevin Murphy, an economic expert for Google, provided testimony to support this claim.

Google's defense also pointed to instances where competition influenced market decisions, such as Mozilla's temporary shift from Google to Yahoo in 2014 due to product quality issues, only to return to Google in 2017 following a decline in Yahoo’s user experience.

Prabhakar Raghavan, head of search at Google, emphasized the firm's dedication to advancing technology through significant research and development investments. This commitment was contrasted with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella's vague responses regarding Microsoft's investment in its own search engine Bing during cross-examination.

The government has accused Google of several anti-competitive behaviors, including delaying the launch of generative AI technology until after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT and considering an incognito search engine that would not store user data—a move that could have potentially cost the company billions in revenue. Additionally, the government alleged that Google manipulated ad prices during times of revenue shortfall.

In response, Google cited its long history of fostering competition by introducing transformative products such as its search engine in 1998, the Chrome browser in 2008, and the Android operating system in 2008. The company also highlighted its competition with newer entrants like TikTok and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which have become alternative sources of online information.

The outcome of this landmark case rests with Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is expected to issue a verdict next year. The decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader tech industry as debates over antitrust laws and digital market dominance continue.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is currently navigating through a challenging antitrust lawsuit. Despite a prediction from Barclays (LON: ) that the tech giant may face a defeat in the U.S. antitrust case, Alphabet's shares experienced an unexpected rise, increasing by 1.5% today. This legal battle has been brought into sharper focus following expert testimony on Monday that disclosed Google derives a significant 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari users.

The spotlight on Google's revenue-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) could provide leverage to regulatory authorities like the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The authority may consider enforcing measures similar to those used in Europe, such as ""choice screens"" for search engines and limits on revenue sharing. These measures have been implemented on some Android devices in Europe but have had limited impact on Alphabet's market valuation.

Despite these challenges, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on Alphabet's financial prospects.

The case against Google has been gaining momentum since earlier in November 2022, when Barclays raised concerns about the formidable case built by the U.S. Justice Department. The unique market dynamics of iOS devices in the U.S., which are due to evolve in 2024, could exacerbate the impact if Google were to lose this legal dispute. This outcome could lead Apple to consider alternatives for its search service, potentially partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing or developing its own search engine.

Mehta at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where it stands accused by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general of illegally monopolizing the search and advertising markets. A decision in the case is expected sometime in 2024.

In today's final arguments, Google's defense hinged on three primary points: the rationale behind its business strategies, evidence of robust competition in the search market, and its positive influence on consumers and overall market competition.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand to justify the company's financial dealings with Apple (NASDAQ: ), explaining that paying for default search engine status on Apple devices was a strategic move meant to boost search usage and revenue. In 2021, Google invested a substantial $26.3 billion to secure its position as the default search engine across various platforms, dedicating $18 billion of that amount to Apple alone.

Addressing claims of monopolistic behavior, Google's legal team pointed to instances of competition within the search engine space. They highlighted Mozilla's temporary adoption of Yahoo as their default search engine in 2014, which ultimately reverted back following user feedback, as an example that other players have had opportunities to enter and compete in the market.

Prabhakar Raghavan, Google’s head of search, emphasized the company's hefty $40 billion investment in research and development over the past year. He stated that such investments have allowed Google to deliver superior technology and services to users. Furthermore, Google argued that its entrance into various markets has actually stimulated more competition rather than stifling it.

The case against Google has been closely watched as it touches on broader concerns about the power wielded by tech giants and their influence on consumer choices and market dynamics.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Google antitrust trial mirrors Microsoft case, nearing conclusion",https://in.investing.com/news/google-antitrust-trial-mirrors-microsoft-case-nearing-conclusion-93CH-3901280,"The high-profile antitrust trial involving tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which commenced in September, is approaching its final stages, with expectations to conclude around Thanksgiving. The legal battle has seen Google defending itself against accusations that it has established an unassailable market position in the search engine sector, similar to the monopoly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) held over PC software in the 1990s.

The prosecution, comprising the Justice Department along with several states, asserts that Google's dominance is built upon user-generated data, creating a significant barrier to entry for any would-be competitors. This narrative draws parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft over two decades ago. In response, Google's defense attorney John Schmidtlein has emphasized the diminishing impact of data accumulation and credits Google's leading position to their substantial investment in human resources and software development.

Central to the case are Google's pay-for-default agreements with major technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). These deals have been flagged by Judge Amit P. Mehta as the ""heart of the case,"" indicating their potential influence on the trial's outcome.

As the proceedings advanced into October, Schmidtlein sought to distinguish Google's circumstances from those of Microsoft by suggesting that barriers to competition in today's search market are less insurmountable than what was seen with personal computer software in the '90s. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this line of reasoning, maintaining his stance on using the Microsoft litigation as a benchmark for this trial.

With a verdict on the horizon, discussions around possible remedies have come into focus. Google maintains that it operates within a fair competitive landscape, while government officials are advocating for stringent sanctions to counteract the company's alleged anticompetitive practices.

The trial's outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader technology industry, particularly concerning how digital markets and user data are regulated. As closing arguments near, all eyes are on Judge Mehta's decision and its potential to reshape the landscape of tech monopolies.

2022-11-14, IANS,Landmark Apple health studies share new glucose control insights on World Diabetes Day,https://in.investing.com/news/landmark-apple-health-studies-share-new-glucose-control-insights-on-world-diabetes-day-3901000,"New Delhi, Nov 14 (IANS) Two public landmark health studies led by Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday shared new findings that reinforce the benefits of physical activity on glucose and highlight some of the many challenges people living with diabetes face every day, including maintaining a target range throughout a menstrual cycle.This year, researchers from Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health collaborated on a study update that evaluates the effects of physical activity and the menstrual cycle on glucose.

Released on the World Diabetes Day that was observed on Tuesday, the analyses used data from both the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) and the Apple Women’s Health Study (AWHS).

As part of the study, as participants increased either the average duration of exercise or the average number of steps taken on a given day, there was a corresponding increase in the average percentage of time glucose fell within the target range of 70-180 mg/dL.

People who exercised more than 30 minutes per day spent 78.8 per cent of day in the target range of 70-180 mg/dL.

Participants who identified as female and walked more than 10,000 steps per day saw the most time spent in the target range of 70-180 mg/dL, compared to 76.4 per cent of participants who identified as male.

On menstrual cycle, analyses of glucose levels across 1,982 menstrual cycles highlighted a slight increase in time spent within the target range of 70-180 mg/dL during the follicular phase when progesterone levels are lower (68.5% of day) compared to the luteal phase (66.8% of day).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a body mass index greater than 30kg/m2 can also increase resistance to insulin and subsequently glucose levels, the findings showed.

Researchers reinforced that early detection of diabetes and intensive glucose management can reduce the risk and severity of many complications.

Shruthi Mahalingaiah, assistant professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that in a preliminary analysis, “our research team has identified an intriguing pattern in continuous glucose measurements across the menstrual cycle among people with regular cycles”.

“During the follicular phase, which is characterised by higher estrogen levels and low progesterone levels, we've observed a slight increase in the time spent within the target glucose range. This discovery holds the potential to significantly improve diabetes management by providing valuable insights for optimising blood sugar control,” Mahalingaiah added.

According to Calum MacRae, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator of the Apple Heart and Movement Study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, empowering users to move their personal physiology in the right direction is a fundamental foundation of precision health and medicine.

“Apple Watch enables users to determine how best to improve their cardiometabolic risk. These data demonstrate that exercising at the right levels can improve how each of us deal with metabolic challenges to reduce the risk of diabetes or to improve the control of diabetes if it does develop,” MacRae explained.

Based on these new research insights — as well as additional input from people with diabetes — Apple highlighted five features on iPhone and Apple Watch that can be useful for those with diabetes, including Activity, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Medical ID, and third-party apps.

While the Activity app allows you to set goals, record duration, and receive reminders about exercise targets, you can track your menstrual cycle, receive period predictions, as well as retrospective estimates of when you likely ovulated with Cycle Tracking.

With the Sleep app, you can set a sleep schedule, receive reminders when to wind down, and track how well you are doing in meeting your sleep goals.

In the Health app, you can update your Medical ID to include information about diabetes and medications, which can be shared in various ways to help in an emergency.

There are also several third party iOS apps affiliated with glucose meters, including CGMs, that help users measure and track their glucose.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,US-China economic ties strained amid political tensions,https://in.investing.com/news/uschina-economic-ties-strained-amid-political-tensions-93CH-3900960,"The once-symbiotic relationship known as ""Chimerica,"" which highlighted the deep economic interdependence between the United States and China, is undergoing significant stress amid escalating political tensions. The term, coined by historian Niall Ferguson, described a period when the US leveraged China's low-cost manufacturing capabilities while China invested heavily in US government bonds, thus lowering American borrowing costs. This dynamic has been disrupted by a series of steep tariffs and export restrictions resulting from a trade war.

Despite these geopolitical strains, the two global powers remain deeply interconnected. Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) continues to produce the majority of its iPhones in China, and Chinese firms are dominant in the solar energy panel market. Moreover, China remains a crucial market for many international brands. The complexity of these commercial ties is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Biden.

As political rifts drive changes in global supply chains, companies are increasingly looking to diversify production. Nations such as Mexico and Central America are becoming more attractive for investments as businesses seek to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing.

The origins of China's trade-centric focus can be traced back to Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the late 1970s. China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was a pivotal moment that granted it broader access to global markets while it pledged to open its own market to foreign competition. Although this led to an influx of affordable goods benefiting US consumers and corporations, it also resulted in significant job losses within the United States, contributing to the economic discontent that partly propelled Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016.

The Biden administration has expressed intentions to lessen America's dependence on Chinese industry, seeking greater resilience and diminished vulnerability to disruptions. However, even as manufacturing shifts to other countries like Vietnam, these goods often still rely on parts and materials sourced from China.

The dissolution of this economic partnership poses challenges and opportunities for global trade as both nations navigate this evolving landscape.

They see the set-up in the sector as strong amid a ""tidal wave"" of AI spending.

""Heading into 2024 we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,"" the analysts commented. ""While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape.""

The analysts highlight that during this tech earnings season, a prominent trend has emerged - the positive influence of AI monetization on the tech sector. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Datadog (NASDAQ: ), and Palantir (NYSE: ) all reported strong results, providing additional validation that AI use cases are rapidly expanding in both the enterprise and consumer domains.

""To this point, we view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995 and believe many on the Street are underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spend set to happen over the next decade in a bonanza for the chip and software sectors looking forward with Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Redmond leading the way,"" the analysts add.

Xiaomi's 14 series, which boasts advanced camera technology and is powered by the latest Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. processor, has been met with enthusiasm, securing over a million orders.

Xiaomi's strategic expansion into electric vehicles (EV) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has also contributed to its recent stock appreciation. The positive momentum is further supported by a significant gross merchandise value reached during the Singles' Day event, which hit a ""historical high,"" and strong third-quarter results that have given Xiaomi an edge over competitors Oppo and Vivo.

On Sunday, industry analysts highlighted the potential for further stock gains driven by Xiaomi's progress in EVs and AIoT. Additionally, Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), and Citigroup forecast a rebound in China's smartphone market next year, spurred by innovative local products and a resurgence in consumer demand.

JPMorgan recently upgraded Xiaomi to 'Overweight,' indicating confidence in the company's trajectory. This endorsement comes at a time when Huawei Technologies is also making headlines with the launch of its Mate 60 Pro featuring a unique camera function, signaling a competitive landscape for smartphone manufacturers in China.

2022-11-13, Investing.com,Bybit ramps up European presence with Mastercard incentives,https://in.investing.com/news/bybit-ramps-up-european-presence-with-mastercard-incentives-93CH-3899900,"In a strategic move to expand its reach in the European market, Bybit, the world's third-largest crypto exchange, has introduced a new incentive scheme for its Mastercard (NYSE: ) service. The initiative includes multiple bonuses aimed at attracting European users, as the company looks to fill the gap left by Binance's recent discontinuation of its Visa (NYSE: ) card services in the region.

Bybit's promotional efforts come on the heels of regulatory challenges that have seen competitors scale back their operations. Earlier in October, Binance opted to retire its Visa card in Europe, redirecting residents to its homepage instead of the Crypto Card portal. The decision was influenced by Binance's desire to concentrate on its primary business activities amidst a tightening regulatory landscape.

In contrast, Bybit is pressing forward with confidence, having launched its Mastercard service in March 2022. The card facilitates crypto-to-fiat transactions and is accepted at over 90 million merchants worldwide that support Mastercard. VIP members benefit from additional perks such as increased loyalty points and cashback rewards.

Bybit announced an incentive program specifically for European customers, featuring a 10 EUR signup bonus, a 5 EUR reward for the first transaction, and an additional 10 EUR for the first deposit made on the platform. This competitive strategy is indicative of Bybit’s commitment to growth in Europe. The firm is not deterred by the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence requirements imposed by the EU's MiCA regulations earlier in July 2022.

While Binance has stepped back due to regulatory concerns and a challenging operational environment following new EEA regulations, Bybit is positioning itself as a viable alternative for European crypto investors. The exchange has also announced future plans to integrate its Mastercard service with mobile payment platforms Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, which will further extend its usability across various merchant locations that accept Mastercard.

2022-11-13, Investing.com,TSMC shares jump on sales improvement amid chip demand surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tsmc-shares-jump-on-sales-improvement-amid-chip-demand-surge-93CH-3899790,"Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) surged during a heavy trading session last Friday, marking their most significant intraday rise since May. This increase came as the chipmaker reported its first monthly sales improvement since February, with October's revenue jumping 15.7% to NT$243.2 billion ($7.5 billion). The spike in shares and revenue contrasts sharply with a 3.7% contraction in revenue to NT$1.78 trillion over the year's first ten months.

The upturn in TSMC's fortunes can be attributed to a growing demand for chips, driven by an artificial intelligence boom that requires more powerful processing capabilities for large language models. CEO C.C Wei has expressed optimism about the semiconductor industry's recovery from a year-long downturn that followed the post-Covid market slump. As a crucial supplier to tech giants such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., TSMC has forecasted its quarterly sales to reach between $18.8 billion and $19.6 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations.

To achieve its sales target for the quarter, TSMC needs to generate approximately $11.7 billion in revenue before the year ends. The company's positive performance is part of a broader tech sector rally that has also been influenced by Wall Street's recent gains.

In related market movements, Asian markets started Monday on a positive note, following Wall Street's rally despite Moody's (NYSE: ) downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook. Technology stocks have been particularly buoyant, benefiting from eased long-term Treasury yields since the beginning of November. The softer labor market figures released on Nov. 3 have prompted speculation about a less aggressive stance from the Federal Reserve, contributing to the stabilization of at around 4.646% by Monday.

The , while not reaching its post-payrolls-report high of 106.01 from Friday, remained robust with the last trade around 105.80. This financial landscape provides a backdrop for TSMC's recent success and suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook for technology investments as the end of the year approaches.

He mentioned that the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ will have an LCD screen that lacks the mini-LED technology of Apple's current iPad Pro models, but will benefit from the same oxide backplane.

""The 12.9-inch iPad Air is an all-new model, and while it lacks mini-LED, it benefits from an Oxide backplane (the same spec as the existing mini-LED iPad Pro’s), offering better display performance than the 10.9-inch iPad Air with a-Si backplane,"" Kuo wrote in a Medium post on Sunday.

According to the analyst, key upgrades will include the M3 processor and OLED displays in the iPad lineup.

Kuo forecasted total iPad shipments of 52-54 million units, a minor increase over the estimated 50 million units shipped this year but still far short of the 63 million pandemic peak of 2022.

He also predicted that the two new OLED iPad Pros, replacing mini-LED, will go into mass production in late 2024 and feature an M3 processor and improved form factor designs.

""Shipments of the two OLED iPad Pro models will be 6-8 million units in 2024, with slightly weaker shipment momentum than the existing iPad Pros, possibly due to the higher price of OLED iPads and potential cannibalisation from the 12.9-inch iPad Air,"" the analyst said.

However, earlier this year, his blood sugar became so low that he lost consciousness while at home alone and hit his head on the floor, reports KSNV.

""I don't know how long I was out for, but when I woke up, the Apple Watch had basically called 911, the paramedics. But I could not talk. I sounded like I had a mouth full of marbles. 911 could not understand me, but they had the GPS from the watch, so they knew where I was,"" Furman was quoted as saying.

In addition, he explained that he had his emergency contacts set up in his device, which enabled him to make contact with his mother, who informed the 911 operator of the medical condition of her son.

""I don't think people know enough about their Apple Watch to realise what it can actually do with the fall detection (feature). People that are elderly probably don't know about the fall detection (feature). You actually have to turn it on on your iPhone,"" Furman said.

In August, Apple Watch's Cardio Fitness notifications helped a healthy man by identifying a major heart issue.

A 40-year-old man who was wearing an Apple Watch Series 6 kept receiving notifications for low VO2 max.

Researchers at Shackler School of Medicine and Leviev Heart Center in Israel conducted tests on the man and diagnosed a major heart problem: familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy with greatly reduced left ventricular systolic function.

May your celebrations be filled with warmth, prosperity, and the joy of being together. Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max by Chandan Khanna”.

The image shows children preparing to release lanterns to the sky to celebrate the festival of lights.

Cook has a tradition to wish Indians a happy Diwali by sharing images shot by ace Indian photographers on iPhones.

When it comes to low-light Diwali photography, the main 48MP camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has already won accolades from professional photographers in India.

According to Gursimran Basra, a famous travel photographer, the new functionality of 48MP high resolution images enables more details to be captured into a photograph.

“iPhone 15 Pro Max's Night Mode is impressive. After focusing the subject, we should be able to keep the phone steady for the Night Mode to do its job for the time being displayed. This enables crisp photographs even in low light conditions,” he had told IANS.

The portrait mode is stunning in iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new 5x Optical Zoom which is equivalent to a 120mm telephoto lens.

“One can capture details of lamps in low light and beautiful portraits of loved ones with the natural light of lamps. Final results will be breathtaking,” Basra added.

Travel photographer and filmmaker Siddhartha Joshi recommends shooting with the standard wide lens (1x) as it captures more light and will give the best results.

""Shoot in Apple RAW if you want to capture maximum details and process the image later on an editing software. Night shots will always have more noise. A great way to get around this is to use ambient light on your subject as you have plenty of thrust on Diwali - this could be diyas, lights or candles,” Joshi told IANS.

The additional light will help bring out the subject better. If you are shooting videos, there might be flicker when shooting with all the beautiful electrical lights at home.

Apple’s shipments declined by a modest 8 per cent, amounting to 17.2 million units.

The late arrival of the iPhone 15, compared to the timing of the iPhone 14, contributed to the decline.

Samsung (KS: )'s volume recovered slightly compared to Q2 2022 as it shipped 6.8 million units. Its new foldables boosted its performance, which accounted for over 20 per cent of its shipments.

Google (NASDAQ: ) Pixel captured 4 per cent market share, shipping 1.2 million units.

“The US smartphone market is stabilizing, but there is no expectation that Q4 will make a turnaround,” said Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys.

Iridium and Qualcomm had announced to enable satellite messaging and emergency services in smartphones powered by Snapdragon Mobile Platforms using Iridium's satellite network.

The companies successfully developed and demonstrated the technology. However, notwithstanding this technical success, smartphone manufacturers have not included the technology in their devices.

Due to this, Qualcomm notified Iridium that it has “elected to terminate the agreements, effective December 3, 2022”.

""While I'm disappointed that this partnership didn't bear immediate fruit, we believe the direction of the industry is clear toward increased satellite connectivity in consumer devices,"" said Iridium CEO Matt Desch.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Stock Market Today: Dow in 2nd weekly win as tech stocks fuel major rebound,https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-little-changed-wall-street-retreats-as-yields-lift-3896676,"Investing.com -- The Dow rallied to notch second-straight weekly win Friday as big tech led a rebound in stocks following a wobble a day earlier when Fed chair Jerome Powell's reminder that rate hikes aren't over rattled markets.

At 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT), the rose 391 points or 1.2%, while the rose 1.5% and the rose 2.1%.

Some Fed speakers opt for less hawkish remarks following Powell's speech; tech leads rally

Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic said Friday he believes the the Fed will get to its 2% target ""without us having to do anything more,"" as the full impact of the rate hikes delivered need more time to filter through the economy.

The remarks were in contrast to Powell's remarks on Thursday, when the Fed chief said the Fed ""was not confident"" they had reach a sufficiently restrictive level of rates to bring down inflation.

""Despite the clear messaging, however, investors have only modestly increased expectations for a rate hike in January from a low of less than 1% to a 19% probability as of late,"" Stifel said in a note.

The rebound in the broader market was underpinned by rally in big tech, with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) leading the move higher in big tech.

Apple agrees to $25 million settlement

The quarterly earnings season is coming to an end, but Plug Power (NASDAQ: ) traded sharply lower, down 39%, after the hydrogen fuel-cell firm's third-quarter revenue missed estimates.

Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is set to pay up to $25 million to settle claims from the Justice Department that the tech giant favored hiring immigrant workers over American citizens and legal green card holders for some jobs. Shares rose 1%.

Plug Power sinks to fresh 52-week, Illumina dives as softer guidance brings storm clouds

Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ: ) reported third-quarter that fell short of analysts estimates on both the top and bottom line owing to hydrogen supply shortages that disrupted operations. It's shares fell 40%.

The disappointing quarterly results drew a string of downgrades from Wall Street analysts, with RBC downgrading the clean energy company to sector perform and slashing its price target on the stock to $5 from $12 a share.

Illumina Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% after cutting its annual guidance following Q3 that missed expectations. The gene-sequencing company said the ""challenging macroeconomic environment"" was weighing on demand.

Oil heads for another losing week

Oil prices rose Friday, but were still heading for a third straight week of steep losses on persistent concerns over slowing global demand and resurgent fears of rising U.S. interest rates.

Both benchmarks are currently down over 5% this week, and on course for the longest weekly losing streak since a four-week drop from mid-April to early May.

Inflation, retail sales in focus next week

An update on inflation and retail sales will dominate investor attention next week following a week of Fed speak that largely pushed back against expectations for sooner rather than later rate cuts.

The core , which is more closely watched by the Fed, is expected to have remained steady in October at a monthly and annual pace of 0.3% and 4.1% respectively.

, meanwhile, could flag a slowdown in the consumer, which has been stronger than many expected, with economists forecast a 0.1% decline in October following a 0.7% a month earlier.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs to transfer GM and Apple credit card portfolios amid strategic shift,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-to-transfer-gm-and-apple-credit-card-portfolios-amid-strategic-shift-93CH-3898348,"As part of a broader strategic retreat from its consumer banking foray, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Bank has announced plans to transfer its GM and Apple (NASDAQ: ) credit card services to another lender. This move comes in the wake of the bank divesting from several retail banking operations, signaling a shift back to its core strengths.

The decision to offload the GM credit card business, which Goldman Sachs acquired from Capital One for $2.5 billion in October 2020, aligns with its current approach to streamline operations. The bank's Platform Solutions division, responsible for the GM credit card program offering rewards for vehicle owners, is actively seeking a new issuer for this service.

In addition to the GM credit card, Goldman Sachs is also considering a sale of its Apple credit card scheme, which was launched in 2019. CEO David Solomon has underscored the importance of focusing on the company's central franchises during a period marked by a contraction in their consumer business segment.

The transition of these credit card services is part of a larger trend at Goldman Sachs, following the sale of their personal loan business that was integrated via the acquisition of GreenSky in 2022. While American Express (NYSE: ) has been mentioned as a potential suitor for the credit card portfolios, the future ownership of these services is yet to be confirmed.

Goldman Sachs' pivot away from consumer lending has been attributed to high costs stemming from its unsuccessful expansion efforts in this area. The Wall Street Journal reported Today that this strategic realignment is an acknowledgment of the challenges faced by the bank in competing within the consumer finance market.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Slide in semiconductor shares extends into Europe after SMIC profit slump,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-chipmakers-slide-tracking-80-profit-slump-in-chinas-smic-3896786,"Investing.com -- European chipmakers dipped on Friday, tracking a fall in some of their Asian peers, after China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK: ) posted an 80% slide in its quarterly income.

SMIC’s profit attributable to owners fell to about $94 million in the three months to Sept. 30, tumbling from the $470.8 million seen in the same period last year.

Quarterly revenue declined by 15% to $1.62 billion, while the chipmaker’s gross margin nearly halved to 19.8% from 38.9% last year.

The firm forecast an even lower gross margin in the fourth quarter, and flagged much higher capital expenditures for 2022, as its capacity utilization dropped amid sluggish demand for semiconductors.

SMIC’s Hong Kong shares fell by 6.8%, while those of rival Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (HK: ) plummeted more than 15%.

Outside of China, Japan’s Advantest (TYO: ), which makes chip testing equipment, lost 0.5%, while SoftBank Group (TYO: ) -- exposed to the chipmaking sector through its Arm (NASDAQ: ) unit -- slid 8.2%, although a bulk of this loss was driven by the tech conglomerate posting an unexpected loss in the September quarter.

The losses bled into Europe, where shares in semiconductor equipment maker ASML (AS: ), the continent's largest tech firm, inched down in mid-morning trading. Fellow chipmakers Infineon (OTC: ) Technologies (ETR: ) and STMicroelectronics (EPA: ) both slumped by more than 2%, while ASM International (AS: ) in the Netherlands lost 1.6%.

SMIC’s results come just a few weeks after dismal quarterly showings from TSMC, Samsung (KS: ) and SK Hynix (KS: ), which pointed to sustained weakness in global chip demand. ASML also posted lower-than-anticipated orders in its latest quarter, and delivered a rare warning over an ""uncertain"" recovery in customer spending.

Major chipmakers have been struggling with slumping demand following a sharp rise in interest rates over the past year, while several major players have raised some doubts over the longevity of a boost from enthusiasm over the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Earlier this week, Softbank’s Arm also logged weak three-month results, and projected disappointing revenue and profit figures for its current quarter. The firm was expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of an AI boom this year, given that its chip designs are used by nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers.

But flagging investment in tech, coupled with slowing demand for personal computers and smartphones, largely offset any major demand boom from AI.

Last week, iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) -- which is also a major customer for Asian chip firms -- clocked a fourth straight quarterly decline in sales.

The conglomerate is poised to receive a hefty $6 billion in dividend income over the next year, with a significant portion of this income—$2.83 billion—stemming from just three companies: Bank of America (NYSE: ), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Bank of America, a holding particularly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations due to inflationary pressures, is set to contribute $991 million to Berkshire's annual dividend income. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum, with its $964 million share, represents a bet on the rising spot prices. This expectation is rooted in the underinvestment seen during the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions, notably Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Apple stands out within Berkshire's portfolio, accounting for over 47% of its total invested assets. The tech giant is anticipated to generate approximately $879 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire. Buffett's attraction to Apple goes beyond dividends; the company's innovative edge, its shift toward a subscription-based model, and aggressive capital-return program through dividends and stock buybacks are key factors that resonate with his investment philosophy.

Buffett's approach has been characterized by a focus on dividend stocks and a concentrated portfolio. For nearly six decades, this strategy has delivered an astounding return exceeding 4,300,000% for Class A shares (NYSE:BRK.A). Known as the Oracle (NYSE: ) of Omaha, Buffett has captivated both Wall Street and everyday investors with his investment acumen. His philosophy emphasizes long-term commitments to brand-name companies that boast strong market positions and reliable management teams.

The flagship smartphone, introduced at Apple's Far Out launch event in September, commands a base price of ₹1,59,900 ($1,199 or approximately ₹99,000 in the US), reflecting its premium components and build.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max stands out with its Bionic A17 chipset, fabricated using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) sophisticated 3nm process. This new processor is not only a hallmark of innovation but also comes with an increased production cost of $30 compared to its predecessor. The device also boasts an upgraded telephoto camera that is 34% more expensive than the previous model, and a durable titanium alloy casing frame that has contributed to an overall cost increase of 18%.

Despite these enhancements leading to an 8% rise in production costs for the base variant compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple has managed to maintain profitability. This is partly due to strategic cost reductions, such as a 4% decrease in display expenses achieved by using LTPO displays from Samsung (KS: ) Display and LG Display (NYSE: ).

Notably, Apple's self-designed components, which now make up 25% of the total bill of materials (BoM) cost—a slight increase from the previous model's 22%—underscore the tech giant's commitment to innovation and market leadership. These proprietary parts include enhanced ultra-wideband (UWB) and power management integrated circuits (ICs).

The increased RAM capacity of 8GB compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max's 6GB RAM further underscores Apple's push towards providing consumers with powerful and feature-rich devices. The balancing act between incorporating cutting-edge technology and managing manufacturing costs demonstrates Apple's ability to meet consumer expectations while maintaining its position at the forefront of the smartphone industry.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,"Powell comments, China's ICBC hit by ransomware attack - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powell-comments-chinas-icbc-hit-by-ransomware-attack--whats-moving-markets-3897508,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were mixed heading into the final day of trading this week, as investors eyed Treasury yield moves and gauged the path ahead for interest rates following a closely-watched statement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Elsewhere, trade in the U.S. Treasury market is disrupted by a cyberattack on China's largest commercial lender by assets, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) agrees to pay out a $25 million settlement over claims regarding its U.S. immigrant hiring practices.

1. Futures mixed

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday after the benchmark ended an eight-day winning streak in the prior session.

By 04:40 ET (09:40 GMT), the contract had added 32 points or 0.1%, were mostly flat, and had inched down by 43 points or 0.3%.

The main indices on Wall Street finished lower on Thursday, as investors digested fresh commentary on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path from Chair Jerome Powell (more below).

The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, bringing the curtain down on its longest series of consecutive positive days in two years. The tech-heavy and 30-stock also slipped by 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.

Rattling investors in particular was a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, with the longer-dated 10-year and 30-year yields both edging up by over 10 basis points. Yields typically move inversely to prices.

2. Powell ""not confident"" policy stance is restrictive enough

Markets were focused on remarks on Thursday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested that the U.S. central bank may have more work to do to bring inflation down to its stated 2% target.

Speaking at an International Monetary Fund event in Washington D.C., Powell said that while a recent cooling in price pressures is encouraging, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to achieving a ""sufficiently restrictive"" policy stance.

""[W]e are not confident that we have achieved such a stance,"" he said in a prepared statement.

It was the latest sign that the Fed could be open to further interest rates hikes, potentially denting nascent investor optimism that policymakers may have finished their long-standing tightening campaign. At its latest meeting last week, the FOMC voted to leave the all-important Fed funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

3. Ransomware attack hits China's ICBC

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has said that its financial services arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trade in the U.S. Treasury market, according to multiple media reports.

ICBC Financial Services, the U.S. branch of the bank, reportedly noted that it is looking into the matter and is making progress in recovering from it.

It also said that Treasury trades carried out on Wednesday and repurchase agreements for trades done on Thursday had been successfully cleared. According to Reuters, some market participants had found that trades going through ICBC had not been settled due to the attack, which aims to paralyze a computer system until a ransom is paid.

A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry told reporters at a news conference that ICBC is ""closely monitoring"" the situation, adding that it is doing its best to minimize the damage from the attack. Business was continuing as normal at other ICBC offices around the world, the spokesperson said.

4. Apple agrees to $25 million settlement over U.S. immigrant hiring practices

Apple is set to pay up to $25 million to settle claims from the U.S. Department of Justice that it favored hiring immigrant workers over American citizens and legal green card holders for some jobs.

The DOJ claimed in a statement that Apple had engaged in a ""pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination"" in recruitment for positions it hired through a federal program allowing employers to sponsor immigrant workers for green cards. The tech giant did not recruit U.S. citizens or permanent residents for jobs that were eligible for the program and had instead favored candidates with temporary work visas, the DOJ said.

In response, Apple said that it had ""unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard,"" adding that it is implementing a ""robust remediation plan.""

The California-based company will be required to pay $6.75 million in civil fines and $18.25 million to an unspecified number of impacted workers, in the biggest-ever settlement for the DOJ involving claims of discrimination based on citizenship.

5. Oil on pace for steep weekly drop

Oil prices rose Friday, but were still heading for a third straight week of steep losses on persistent concerns over slowing global demand and resurgent fears of rising U.S. interest rates.

Worries over possible supply disruptions stemming from the conflict between Israel and Hamas have also started to wane.

By 04:41 ET, the futures traded 0.9% higher at $76.42 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.0% to $80.77 per barrel.

Both benchmarks are currently down over 5% this week, and are on course for their longest weekly losing streak since a four-week drop from mid-April to early May."
2022-11-10, IANS,"Apple, US govt reach $25 mn settlement over job bias allegations",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-us-govt-reach-25-mn-settlement-over-job-bias-allegations-3896789,"New York, Nov 10 (IANS) Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve allegations that the tech giant illegally discriminated in hiring and recruitment against American citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the country does not expire. Pursuant to the $25 million agreement, Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and establish an $18.25 million back pay fund for eligible discrimination victims.

This is the largest award recovered under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the DOJ announced on Thursday.

“Creating unlawful barriers that make it harder for someone to seek a job because of their citizenship status will not be tolerated,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Department’s Civil Rights Division.

“This resolution reflects the Civil Rights Division’s commitment to ending illegal discriminatory employment practices,” Clarke added.

The settlement agreement resolves the department’s determination that Apple violated the INA’s anti-discrimination requirements during Apple’s recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labour certification program (PERM).

The PERM program is administered by the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security.

It allows employers to sponsor workers for lawful permanent resident status in the US after completing recruitment and meeting other program requirements.

Any US employer that utilizes the PERM program cannot illegally discriminate in hiring or recruitment based on citizenship or immigration status.

The Department’s investigation, which started in February 2019, found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM.

It also found that the company’s unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status.

These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries.

Specifically, the department’s investigation found that Apple did not advertise positions Apple sought to fill through the PERM program on its external job website, even though its standard practice was to post other job positions on this website.

It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions.

In some instances, Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail.

These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire.

The agreement also requires Apple to ensure that its recruitment for PERM positions more closely matches its standard recruitment practices.

Specifically, Apple will be required to conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system.

Apple has implemented some of these measures after the department opened its investigation.

Additionally, Apple will train its employees on the INA’s anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement.

2022-11-14, IANS,Landmark Apple health studies share new glucose control insights on World Diabetes Day,https://in.investing.com/news/landmark-apple-health-studies-share-new-glucose-control-insights-on-world-diabetes-day-3901000,"New Delhi, Nov 14 (IANS) Two public landmark health studies led by Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Tuesday shared new findings that reinforce the benefits of physical activity on glucose and highlight some of the many challenges people living with diabetes face every day, including maintaining a target range throughout a menstrual cycle.This year, researchers from Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health collaborated on a study update that evaluates the effects of physical activity and the menstrual cycle on glucose.

Released on the World Diabetes Day that was observed on Tuesday, the analyses used data from both the Apple Heart and Movement Study (AHMS) and the Apple Women’s Health Study (AWHS).

As part of the study, as participants increased either the average duration of exercise or the average number of steps taken on a given day, there was a corresponding increase in the average percentage of time glucose fell within the target range of 70-180 mg/dL.

People who exercised more than 30 minutes per day spent 78.8 per cent of day in the target range of 70-180 mg/dL.

Participants who identified as female and walked more than 10,000 steps per day saw the most time spent in the target range of 70-180 mg/dL, compared to 76.4 per cent of participants who identified as male.

On menstrual cycle, analyses of glucose levels across 1,982 menstrual cycles highlighted a slight increase in time spent within the target range of 70-180 mg/dL during the follicular phase when progesterone levels are lower (68.5% of day) compared to the luteal phase (66.8% of day).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and a body mass index greater than 30kg/m2 can also increase resistance to insulin and subsequently glucose levels, the findings showed.

Researchers reinforced that early detection of diabetes and intensive glucose management can reduce the risk and severity of many complications.

Shruthi Mahalingaiah, assistant professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that in a preliminary analysis, “our research team has identified an intriguing pattern in continuous glucose measurements across the menstrual cycle among people with regular cycles”.

“During the follicular phase, which is characterised by higher estrogen levels and low progesterone levels, we've observed a slight increase in the time spent within the target glucose range. This discovery holds the potential to significantly improve diabetes management by providing valuable insights for optimising blood sugar control,” Mahalingaiah added.

According to Calum MacRae, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and principal investigator of the Apple Heart and Movement Study at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, empowering users to move their personal physiology in the right direction is a fundamental foundation of precision health and medicine.

“Apple Watch enables users to determine how best to improve their cardiometabolic risk. These data demonstrate that exercising at the right levels can improve how each of us deal with metabolic challenges to reduce the risk of diabetes or to improve the control of diabetes if it does develop,” MacRae explained.

Based on these new research insights — as well as additional input from people with diabetes — Apple highlighted five features on iPhone and Apple Watch that can be useful for those with diabetes, including Activity, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Medical ID, and third-party apps.

While the Activity app allows you to set goals, record duration, and receive reminders about exercise targets, you can track your menstrual cycle, receive period predictions, as well as retrospective estimates of when you likely ovulated with Cycle Tracking.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,US-China economic ties strained amid political tensions,https://in.investing.com/news/uschina-economic-ties-strained-amid-political-tensions-93CH-3900960,"The once-symbiotic relationship known as ""Chimerica,"" which highlighted the deep economic interdependence between the United States and China, is undergoing significant stress amid escalating political tensions. The term, coined by historian Niall Ferguson, described a period when the US leveraged China's low-cost manufacturing capabilities while China invested heavily in US government bonds, thus lowering American borrowing costs. This dynamic has been disrupted by a series of steep tariffs and export restrictions resulting from a trade war.

Despite these geopolitical strains, the two global powers remain deeply interconnected. Tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) continues to produce the majority of its iPhones in China, and Chinese firms are dominant in the solar energy panel market. Moreover, China remains a crucial market for many international brands. The complexity of these commercial ties is expected to be a key topic during the upcoming meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Biden.

As political rifts drive changes in global supply chains, companies are increasingly looking to diversify production. Nations such as Mexico and Central America are becoming more attractive for investments as businesses seek to reduce their reliance on Chinese manufacturing.

The origins of China's trade-centric focus can be traced back to Deng Xiaoping's reforms in the late 1970s. China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001 was a pivotal moment that granted it broader access to global markets while it pledged to open its own market to foreign competition. Although this led to an influx of affordable goods benefiting US consumers and corporations, it also resulted in significant job losses within the United States, contributing to the economic discontent that partly propelled Donald J. Trump to the presidency in 2016.

The Biden administration has expressed intentions to lessen America's dependence on Chinese industry, seeking greater resilience and diminished vulnerability to disruptions. However, even as manufacturing shifts to other countries like Vietnam, these goods often still rely on parts and materials sourced from China.

The dissolution of this economic partnership poses challenges and opportunities for global trade as both nations navigate this evolving landscape.

They see the set-up in the sector as strong amid a ""tidal wave"" of AI spending.

""Heading into 2024 we believe the tech sector is set up for an acceleration of spending around cloud and AI spending that we believe is being significantly underestimated by the Street,"" the analysts commented. ""While IT budgets are expected to be up modestly in 2024, we believe cloud and AI driven spending will be up 20%-25% over the next year with use cases now exploding across the enterprise and consumer landscape.""

The analysts highlight that during this tech earnings season, a prominent trend has emerged - the positive influence of AI monetization on the tech sector. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Datadog (NASDAQ: ), and Palantir (NYSE: ) all reported strong results, providing additional validation that AI use cases are rapidly expanding in both the enterprise and consumer domains.

""To this point, we view AI as the most transformative technology trend since the start of the Internet in 1995 and believe many on the Street are underestimating the $1 trillion of AI spend set to happen over the next decade in a bonanza for the chip and software sectors looking forward with Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Redmond leading the way,"" the analysts add.

The surge comes as rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). faces a sales downturn in China and as Xiaomi expands into electric vehicles and advanced technologies.

The company's success is attributed to multiple factors, including the strong performance of its latest handset series and its robust overseas market presence. Xiaomi's 14 series, which boasts advanced camera technology and is powered by the latest Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. processor, has been met with enthusiasm, securing over a million orders.

Xiaomi's strategic expansion into electric vehicles (EV) and Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has also contributed to its recent stock appreciation. The positive momentum is further supported by a significant gross merchandise value reached during the Singles' Day event, which hit a ""historical high,"" and strong third-quarter results that have given Xiaomi an edge over competitors Oppo and Vivo.

On Sunday, industry analysts highlighted the potential for further stock gains driven by Xiaomi's progress in EVs and AIoT. Additionally, Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), and Citigroup forecast a rebound in China's smartphone market next year, spurred by innovative local products and a resurgence in consumer demand.

JPMorgan recently upgraded Xiaomi to 'Overweight,' indicating confidence in the company's trajectory.

The initiative includes multiple bonuses aimed at attracting European users, as the company looks to fill the gap left by Binance's recent discontinuation of its Visa (NYSE: ) card services in the region.

Bybit's promotional efforts come on the heels of regulatory challenges that have seen competitors scale back their operations. Earlier in October, Binance opted to retire its Visa card in Europe, redirecting residents to its homepage instead of the Crypto Card portal. The decision was influenced by Binance's desire to concentrate on its primary business activities amidst a tightening regulatory landscape.

In contrast, Bybit is pressing forward with confidence, having launched its Mastercard service in March 2022. The card facilitates crypto-to-fiat transactions and is accepted at over 90 million merchants worldwide that support Mastercard. VIP members benefit from additional perks such as increased loyalty points and cashback rewards.

Bybit announced an incentive program specifically for European customers, featuring a 10 EUR signup bonus, a 5 EUR reward for the first transaction, and an additional 10 EUR for the first deposit made on the platform. This competitive strategy is indicative of Bybit’s commitment to growth in Europe. The firm is not deterred by the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence requirements imposed by the EU's MiCA regulations earlier in July 2022.

While Binance has stepped back due to regulatory concerns and a challenging operational environment following new EEA regulations, Bybit is positioning itself as a viable alternative for European crypto investors. The exchange has also announced future plans to integrate its Mastercard service with mobile payment platforms Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, which will further extend its usability across various merchant locations that accept Mastercard.

2022-11-13, Investing.com,TSMC shares jump on sales improvement amid chip demand surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tsmc-shares-jump-on-sales-improvement-amid-chip-demand-surge-93CH-3899790,"Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) surged during a heavy trading session last Friday, marking their most significant intraday rise since May. This increase came as the chipmaker reported its first monthly sales improvement since February, with October's revenue jumping 15.7% to NT$243.2 billion ($7.5 billion). The spike in shares and revenue contrasts sharply with a 3.7% contraction in revenue to NT$1.78 trillion over the year's first ten months.

The upturn in TSMC's fortunes can be attributed to a growing demand for chips, driven by an artificial intelligence boom that requires more powerful processing capabilities for large language models. CEO C.C Wei has expressed optimism about the semiconductor industry's recovery from a year-long downturn that followed the post-Covid market slump. As a crucial supplier to tech giants such as Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., TSMC has forecasted its quarterly sales to reach between $18.8 billion and $19.6 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations.

To achieve its sales target for the quarter, TSMC needs to generate approximately $11.7 billion in revenue before the year ends. The company's positive performance is part of a broader tech sector rally that has also been influenced by Wall Street's recent gains.

In related market movements, Asian markets started Monday on a positive note, following Wall Street's rally despite Moody's (NYSE: ) downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook. Technology stocks have been particularly buoyant, benefiting from eased long-term Treasury yields since the beginning of November. The softer labor market figures released on Nov. 3 have prompted speculation about a less aggressive stance from the Federal Reserve, contributing to the stabilization of at around 4.646% by Monday.

The , while not reaching its post-payrolls-report high of 106.01 from Friday, remained robust with the last trade around 105.80.

He mentioned that the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ will have an LCD screen that lacks the mini-LED technology of Apple's current iPad Pro models, but will benefit from the same oxide backplane.

""The 12.9-inch iPad Air is an all-new model, and while it lacks mini-LED, it benefits from an Oxide backplane (the same spec as the existing mini-LED iPad Pro’s), offering better display performance than the 10.9-inch iPad Air with a-Si backplane,"" Kuo wrote in a Medium post on Sunday.

According to the analyst, key upgrades will include the M3 processor and OLED displays in the iPad lineup.

Kuo forecasted total iPad shipments of 52-54 million units, a minor increase over the estimated 50 million units shipped this year but still far short of the 63 million pandemic peak of 2022.

He also predicted that the two new OLED iPad Pros, replacing mini-LED, will go into mass production in late 2024 and feature an M3 processor and improved form factor designs.

""Shipments of the two OLED iPad Pro models will be 6-8 million units in 2024, with slightly weaker shipment momentum than the existing iPad Pros, possibly due to the higher price of OLED iPads and potential cannibalisation from the 12.9-inch iPad Air,"" the analyst said.

However, earlier this year, his blood sugar became so low that he lost consciousness while at home alone and hit his head on the floor, reports KSNV.

""I don't know how long I was out for, but when I woke up, the Apple Watch had basically called 911, the paramedics. But I could not talk. I sounded like I had a mouth full of marbles. 911 could not understand me, but they had the GPS from the watch, so they knew where I was,"" Furman was quoted as saying.

In addition, he explained that he had his emergency contacts set up in his device, which enabled him to make contact with his mother, who informed the 911 operator of the medical condition of her son.

""I don't think people know enough about their Apple Watch to realise what it can actually do with the fall detection (feature). People that are elderly probably don't know about the fall detection (feature). You actually have to turn it on on your iPhone,"" Furman said.

In August, Apple Watch's Cardio Fitness notifications helped a healthy man by identifying a major heart issue.

A 40-year-old man who was wearing an Apple Watch Series 6 kept receiving notifications for low VO2 max.

Researchers at Shackler School of Medicine and Leviev Heart Center in Israel conducted tests on the man and diagnosed a major heart problem: familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy with greatly reduced left ventricular systolic function.

May your celebrations be filled with warmth, prosperity, and the joy of being together. Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max by Chandan Khanna”.

The image shows children preparing to release lanterns to the sky to celebrate the festival of lights.

Cook has a tradition to wish Indians a happy Diwali by sharing images shot by ace Indian photographers on iPhones.

When it comes to low-light Diwali photography, the main 48MP camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has already won accolades from professional photographers in India.

According to Gursimran Basra, a famous travel photographer, the new functionality of 48MP high resolution images enables more details to be captured into a photograph.

“iPhone 15 Pro Max's Night Mode is impressive. After focusing the subject, we should be able to keep the phone steady for the Night Mode to do its job for the time being displayed. This enables crisp photographs even in low light conditions,” he had told IANS.

The portrait mode is stunning in iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new 5x Optical Zoom which is equivalent to a 120mm telephoto lens.

“One can capture details of lamps in low light and beautiful portraits of loved ones with the natural light of lamps. Final results will be breathtaking,” Basra added.

Travel photographer and filmmaker Siddhartha Joshi recommends shooting with the standard wide lens (1x) as it captures more light and will give the best results.

""Shoot in Apple RAW if you want to capture maximum details and process the image later on an editing software. Night shots will always have more noise. A great way to get around this is to use ambient light on your subject as you have plenty of thrust on Diwali - this could be diyas, lights or candles,” Joshi told IANS.

The additional light will help bring out the subject better. If you are shooting videos, there might be flicker when shooting with all the beautiful electrical lights at home.

Apple’s shipments declined by a modest 8 per cent, amounting to 17.2 million units.

The late arrival of the iPhone 15, compared to the timing of the iPhone 14, contributed to the decline.

Samsung (KS: )'s volume recovered slightly compared to Q2 2022 as it shipped 6.8 million units. Its new foldables boosted its performance, which accounted for over 20 per cent of its shipments.

Google (NASDAQ: ) Pixel captured 4 per cent market share, shipping 1.2 million units.

“The US smartphone market is stabilizing, but there is no expectation that Q4 will make a turnaround,” said Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys.

The iPhone 15 series had a strong start in September, accounting for 34 per cent of all iPhone sales in the US during Q3.

“The annual refresh of the iPhone portfolio remains paramount to all carriers, even to smaller challengers such as Boost Infinite, to attract switchers.

The sales boost is attributed to the high demand for AI chips and the release of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15, contributing to a year-over-year revenue rise of 15.7%.

The company also announced plans to establish a second wafer fabrication plant in Japan, focusing on advanced 6nm process technology, bolstered by a $4.96 billion investment from the Japanese government. This move is part of a larger $13 billion initiative by Japan to bolster its semiconductor and generative AI capabilities, which includes TSMC's existing operations in Kumamoto.

Analysts are optimistic about TSMC's growth prospects, with Wedbush Securities' Matt Bryson predicting a robust fourth quarter driven by the seasonal demand for Apple products and the continued expansion of AI applications. TSMC's pivotal role as a supplier to industry giants such as Apple, AMD (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) positions it well to benefit from positive shifts in handset market dynamics and a recovery in macro conditions.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs to transfer GM and Apple credit card portfolios amid strategic shift,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-to-transfer-gm-and-apple-credit-card-portfolios-amid-strategic-shift-93CH-3898348,"As part of a broader strategic retreat from its consumer banking foray, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Bank has announced plans to transfer its GM and Apple (NASDAQ: ) credit card services to another lender. This move comes in the wake of the bank divesting from several retail banking operations, signaling a shift back to its core strengths.

The decision to offload the GM credit card business, which Goldman Sachs acquired from Capital One for $2.5 billion in October 2020, aligns with its current approach to streamline operations. The bank's Platform Solutions division, responsible for the GM credit card program offering rewards for vehicle owners, is actively seeking a new issuer for this service.

In addition to the GM credit card, Goldman Sachs is also considering a sale of its Apple credit card scheme, which was launched in 2019. CEO David Solomon has underscored the importance of focusing on the company's central franchises during a period marked by a contraction in their consumer business segment.

The transition of these credit card services is part of a larger trend at Goldman Sachs, following the sale of their personal loan business that was integrated via the acquisition of GreenSky in 2022. While American Express (NYSE: ) has been mentioned as a potential suitor for the credit card portfolios, the future ownership of these services is yet to be confirmed.

Goldman Sachs' pivot away from consumer lending has been attributed to high costs stemming from its unsuccessful expansion efforts in this area. The Wall Street Journal reported Today that this strategic realignment is an acknowledgment of the challenges faced by the bank in competing within the consumer finance market.

The tech giant has experienced a persistent decline in sales for four consecutive quarters, a trend that is raising concerns among investors and shaking its position at the top.

Market capitalization, which represents the total value of a company's outstanding shares, is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares available. As Apple's sales continue to wane, its market cap has come under pressure, opening the door for competitors like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). to close the gap.

Microsoft has been on an upward growth trajectory and, if current trends persist, is poised to overtake Apple by 2025. This looming change in market leadership is prompting investors to reconsider their portfolios, with some looking towards more stable stocks as alternatives to Apple.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Slide in semiconductor shares extends into Europe after SMIC profit slump,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-chipmakers-slide-tracking-80-profit-slump-in-chinas-smic-3896786,"Investing.com -- European chipmakers dipped on Friday, tracking a fall in some of their Asian peers, after China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK: ) posted an 80% slide in its quarterly income.

SMIC’s profit attributable to owners fell to about $94 million in the three months to Sept. 30, tumbling from the $470.8 million seen in the same period last year.

Quarterly revenue declined by 15% to $1.62 billion, while the chipmaker’s gross margin nearly halved to 19.8% from 38.9% last year.

The firm forecast an even lower gross margin in the fourth quarter, and flagged much higher capital expenditures for 2022, as its capacity utilization dropped amid sluggish demand for semiconductors.

SMIC’s Hong Kong shares fell by 6.8%, while those of rival Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd (HK: ) plummeted more than 15%.

Outside of China, Japan’s Advantest (TYO: ), which makes chip testing equipment, lost 0.5%, while SoftBank Group (TYO: ) -- exposed to the chipmaking sector through its Arm (NASDAQ: ) unit -- slid 8.2%, although a bulk of this loss was driven by the tech conglomerate posting an unexpected loss in the September quarter.

The losses bled into Europe, where shares in semiconductor equipment maker ASML (AS: ), the continent's largest tech firm, inched down in mid-morning trading. Fellow chipmakers Infineon (OTC: ) Technologies (ETR: ) and STMicroelectronics (EPA: ) both slumped by more than 2%, while ASM International (AS: ) in the Netherlands lost 1.6%.

SMIC’s results come just a few weeks after dismal quarterly showings from TSMC, Samsung (KS: ) and SK Hynix (KS: ), which pointed to sustained weakness in global chip demand. ASML also posted lower-than-anticipated orders in its latest quarter, and delivered a rare warning over an ""uncertain"" recovery in customer spending.

Major chipmakers have been struggling with slumping demand following a sharp rise in interest rates over the past year, while several major players have raised some doubts over the longevity of a boost from enthusiasm over the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Earlier this week, Softbank’s Arm also logged weak three-month results, and projected disappointing revenue and profit figures for its current quarter. The firm was expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of an AI boom this year, given that its chip designs are used by nearly all major semiconductor manufacturers.

But flagging investment in tech, coupled with slowing demand for personal computers and smartphones, largely offset any major demand boom from AI.

Last week, iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) -- which is also a major customer for Asian chip firms -- clocked a fourth straight quarterly decline in sales.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sets to collect $6 billion in dividends,https://in.investing.com/news/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sets-to-collect-6-billion-in-dividends-93CH-3897607,"In the investment world, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) stands as a testament to the power of strategic, long-term investing. The conglomerate is poised to receive a hefty $6 billion in dividend income over the next year, with a significant portion of this income—$2.83 billion—stemming from just three companies: Bank of America (NYSE: ), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

Bank of America, a holding particularly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations due to inflationary pressures, is set to contribute $991 million to Berkshire's annual dividend income. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum, with its $964 million share, represents a bet on the rising spot prices. This expectation is rooted in the underinvestment seen during the pandemic and ongoing geopolitical tensions, notably Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Apple stands out within Berkshire's portfolio, accounting for over 47% of its total invested assets. The tech giant is anticipated to generate approximately $879 million in annual dividend income for Berkshire. Buffett's attraction to Apple goes beyond dividends; the company's innovative edge, its shift toward a subscription-based model, and aggressive capital-return program through dividends and stock buybacks are key factors that resonate with his investment philosophy.

Buffett's approach has been characterized by a focus on dividend stocks and a concentrated portfolio. For nearly six decades, this strategy has delivered an astounding return exceeding 4,300,000% for Class A shares (NYSE:BRK.A). Known as the Oracle (NYSE: ) of Omaha, Buffett has captivated both Wall Street and everyday investors with his investment acumen. His philosophy emphasizes long-term commitments to brand-name companies that boast strong market positions and reliable management teams.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Max showcases cutting-edge features at a premium,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-iphone-15-pro-max-showcases-cuttingedge-features-at-a-premium-93CH-3897593,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has once again raised the bar with its latest offering, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which debuted with a host of advanced technological features. The flagship smartphone, introduced at Apple's Far Out launch event in September, commands a base price of ₹1,59,900 ($1,199 or approximately ₹99,000 in the US), reflecting its premium components and build.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max stands out with its Bionic A17 chipset, fabricated using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) sophisticated 3nm process. This new processor is not only a hallmark of innovation but also comes with an increased production cost of $30 compared to its predecessor. The device also boasts an upgraded telephoto camera that is 34% more expensive than the previous model, and a durable titanium alloy casing frame that has contributed to an overall cost increase of 18%.

Despite these enhancements leading to an 8% rise in production costs for the base variant compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max, Apple has managed to maintain profitability. This is partly due to strategic cost reductions, such as a 4% decrease in display expenses achieved by using LTPO displays from Samsung (KS: ) Display and LG Display (NYSE: ).

Notably, Apple's self-designed components, which now make up 25% of the total bill of materials (BoM) cost—a slight increase from the previous model's 22%—underscore the tech giant's commitment to innovation and market leadership. These proprietary parts include enhanced ultra-wideband (UWB) and power management integrated circuits (ICs).

The increased RAM capacity of 8GB compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max's 6GB RAM further underscores Apple's push towards providing consumers with powerful and feature-rich devices. The balancing act between incorporating cutting-edge technology and managing manufacturing costs demonstrates Apple's ability to meet consumer expectations while maintaining its position at the forefront of the smartphone industry.

2022-11-10, Investing.com,"Powell comments, China's ICBC hit by ransomware attack - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powell-comments-chinas-icbc-hit-by-ransomware-attack--whats-moving-markets-3897508,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were mixed heading into the final day of trading this week, as investors eyed Treasury yield moves and gauged the path ahead for interest rates following a closely-watched statement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Elsewhere, trade in the U.S. Treasury market is disrupted by a cyberattack on China's largest commercial lender by assets, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) agrees to pay out a $25 million settlement over claims regarding its U.S. immigrant hiring practices.

1. Futures mixed

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday after the benchmark ended an eight-day winning streak in the prior session.

By 04:40 ET (09:40 GMT), the contract had added 32 points or 0.1%, were mostly flat, and had inched down by 43 points or 0.3%.

The main indices on Wall Street finished lower on Thursday, as investors digested fresh commentary on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy path from Chair Jerome Powell (more below).

The S&P 500 fell by 0.8%, bringing the curtain down on its longest series of consecutive positive days in two years. The tech-heavy and 30-stock also slipped by 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively.

Rattling investors in particular was a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, with the longer-dated 10-year and 30-year yields both edging up by over 10 basis points. Yields typically move inversely to prices.

2. Powell ""not confident"" policy stance is restrictive enough

Markets were focused on remarks on Thursday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who suggested that the U.S. central bank may have more work to do to bring inflation down to its stated 2% target.

Speaking at an International Monetary Fund event in Washington D.C., Powell said that while a recent cooling in price pressures is encouraging, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to achieving a ""sufficiently restrictive"" policy stance.

""[W]e are not confident that we have achieved such a stance,"" he said in a prepared statement.

It was the latest sign that the Fed could be open to further interest rates hikes, potentially denting nascent investor optimism that policymakers may have finished their long-standing tightening campaign. At its latest meeting last week, the FOMC voted to leave the all-important Fed funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

3. Ransomware attack hits China's ICBC

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has said that its financial services arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trade in the U.S. Treasury market, according to multiple media reports.

ICBC Financial Services, the U.S. branch of the bank, reportedly noted that it is looking into the matter and is making progress in recovering from it.

It also said that Treasury trades carried out on Wednesday and repurchase agreements for trades done on Thursday had been successfully cleared. According to Reuters, some market participants had found that trades going through ICBC had not been settled due to the attack, which aims to paralyze a computer system until a ransom is paid.

A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry told reporters at a news conference that ICBC is ""closely monitoring"" the situation, adding that it is doing its best to minimize the damage from the attack. Business was continuing as normal at other ICBC offices around the world, the spokesperson said.

4. Apple agrees to $25 million settlement over U.S. immigrant hiring practices

Apple is set to pay up to $25 million to settle claims from the U.S. Department of Justice that it favored hiring immigrant workers over American citizens and legal green card holders for some jobs.

The DOJ claimed in a statement that Apple had engaged in a ""pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination"" in recruitment for positions it hired through a federal program allowing employers to sponsor immigrant workers for green cards. The tech giant did not recruit U.S. citizens or permanent residents for jobs that were eligible for the program and had instead favored candidates with temporary work visas, the DOJ said.

In response, Apple said that it had ""unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard,"" adding that it is implementing a ""robust remediation plan.""

The California-based company will be required to pay $6.75 million in civil fines and $18.25 million to an unspecified number of impacted workers, in the biggest-ever settlement for the DOJ involving claims of discrimination based on citizenship.

5. Oil on pace for steep weekly drop

Oil prices rose Friday, but were still heading for a third straight week of steep losses on persistent concerns over slowing global demand and resurgent fears of rising U.S. interest rates.

Worries over possible supply disruptions stemming from the conflict between Israel and Hamas have also started to wane.

By 04:41 ET, the futures traded 0.9% higher at $76.42 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.0% to $80.77 per barrel.

Both benchmarks are currently down over 5% this week, and are on course for their longest weekly losing streak since a four-week drop from mid-April to early May."
2022-11-10, IANS,"Apple, US govt reach $25 mn settlement over job bias allegations",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-us-govt-reach-25-mn-settlement-over-job-bias-allegations-3896789,"New York, Nov 10 (IANS) Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) reached an agreement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve allegations that the tech giant illegally discriminated in hiring and recruitment against American citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the country does not expire. Pursuant to the $25 million agreement, Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and establish an $18.25 million back pay fund for eligible discrimination victims.

This is the largest award recovered under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the DOJ announced on Thursday.

“Creating unlawful barriers that make it harder for someone to seek a job because of their citizenship status will not be tolerated,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Department’s Civil Rights Division.

“This resolution reflects the Civil Rights Division’s commitment to ending illegal discriminatory employment practices,” Clarke added.

The settlement agreement resolves the department’s determination that Apple violated the INA’s anti-discrimination requirements during Apple’s recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labour certification program (PERM).

The PERM program is administered by the Department of Labor and the Department of Homeland Security.

It allows employers to sponsor workers for lawful permanent resident status in the US after completing recruitment and meeting other program requirements.

Any US employer that utilizes the PERM program cannot illegally discriminate in hiring or recruitment based on citizenship or immigration status.

The Department’s investigation, which started in February 2019, found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM.

It also found that the company’s unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status.

These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries.

Specifically, the department’s investigation found that Apple did not advertise positions Apple sought to fill through the PERM program on its external job website, even though its standard practice was to post other job positions on this website.

It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions.

In some instances, Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail.

These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire.

The agreement also requires Apple to ensure that its recruitment for PERM positions more closely matches its standard recruitment practices.

Specifically, Apple will be required to conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system.

Apple has implemented some of these measures after the department opened its investigation.

Additionally, Apple will train its employees on the INA’s anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs seeks new issuer for GM credit card amid consumer business exit,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-seeks-new-issuer-for-gm-credit-card-amid-consumer-business-exit-93CH-3896160,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) has initiated the process of finding a new issuer for its General Motors (NYSE: ) credit card, a step further in its ongoing retreat from retail banking, according to reports on Tuesday, November 7, 2022. The GM credit card was launched less than two years ago as part of Goldman Sachs' consumer lending venture, targeting GM vehicle owners.

This move comes after the bank sold its personal finance unit to Creative Planning in August 2022 and specialty lender GreenSky to Sixth Street Partners and other firms in early October. The sale of GreenSky followed a 33% fall in third-quarter profits from last year, largely due to a Greensky (NASDAQ: ) write-down that reduced pre-tax profits by nearly $1 billion.

In addition to the GM credit card, Goldman Sachs is also considering exiting the credit card business it launched with Apple (NASDAQ: ) in 2019. Talks have been held with American Express (NYSE:NYSE: ) about potentially taking over both these programs. CEO David Solomon stated on the third-quarter earnings call that Goldman Sachs does not have the unilateral right to exit these long-term contracts but emphasized on managing them better for drag reduction and profitability progress.

The retreat from consumer business began under Solomon's leadership. In October 2020, Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions division outbid Barclays (LON: ) to acquire the GM credit card business from Capital One for $2.5 billion. The bank also acquired fintech lender and 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) provider GreenSky in 2021 for $2.24 billion, only to sell it two years later.

These strategic shifts come as Goldman Sachs grapples with a slump in the dealmaking market while trying to streamline operations and improve profitability.

The company reported a 28% annual revenue increase in its first post-IPO earnings report on Wednesday. However, shares fell by over 7% due to lower-than-expected revenue guidance.

Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, Arm achieved breakthrough success when the Arm610 processor powered Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Newton device in 1993. Today, it licenses its architecture to CPU manufacturers and collects royalties from each chip shipped with its technology. Despite a slump in smartphone sales and geopolitical risks with China, which accounts for 20% of its revenue, Arm is making strides in the laptop market through a partnership with Apple and is experiencing growth in the automotive industry due to the rise of self-driving capabilities and partnerships with companies like Cruise.

In response to the global chip shortage highlighting Arm's critical role in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) announced its latest Grace Hopper Superchip. This couples Nvidia's GPUs with Arm's Neoverse cores, underscoring Arm's influence in high-performance computing.

Arm is also involved in a legal dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) over chip production rights following Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Furthermore, there is significant controversy surrounding Arm China, an independent entity majority-owned by Chinese investors embroiled in a leadership dispute. Former Arm China employees have started a new internal chip design company with backing from Shenzhen's government.

Despite these challenges, Arm has diversified into emerging markets including AI and has launched its Neoverse line for high-performance and cloud computing applications. The company has partnerships with major tech companies including Apple, Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). However, a labor shortage at TSMC is affecting its $40 billion fab under construction.

Arm's primary competitor remains Intel's x86 architecture. However, software componentization is making it easier for other architectures like Arm to run on servers. It also faces competition from RISC-V, an open-source rival architecture gaining traction among key customers like Google and Samsung.

Despite a failed acquisition attempt by Nvidia and challenges such as declining smartphone sales, Arm continues to evolve and is positioning itself as a crucial player in the future of computing.

The announcement was made Today, with the chip surpassing the performance per watt and power efficiency of Apple (NASDAQ: ) M2 and Intel (NASDAQ: ) chips. The Snapdragon X Elite chip is designed with integrated generative AI, aligning with the increasing trend of integrating neural processing units into every chip.

The new chip was unveiled by Qualcomm's Alex Katouzian at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii in October 2022. Anshel Sag of Moor Insights and Strategy expressed that this innovation could pose a significant challenge to Intel and AMD (NASDAQ: ). Black Magic also demonstrated how their DaVinci Resolve Studio software could utilize the AI capabilities of the X Elite chip to further improve performance.

In addition to its superior performance, the Snapdragon X Elite chip is designed for unique applications. Qualcomm expects that laptops powered by this new chip, targeting creators and casual gamers, will launch in mid-2024. These laptops are expected to have a substantial impact on PC performance due to their on-the-go computing capabilities and intensive task handling.

Despite the upcoming release of Apple's more potent M3-based Macs and the incumbency advantages of Intel and AMD, Techsponential's analysis supports industry optimism about Qualcomm's success. Kedar Kondap at Qualcomm anticipates the release of the first laptops powered by the Snapdragon X Elite, emphasizing that on-device AI, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Copilot, will attract consumers across industries.

As Qualcomm prepares for the X Elite launch in December 2022, Intel plans to release its Meteor Lake laptop processor. Avi Greengart from Techsponential points out Intel's advantages but acknowledges Qualcomm's significant performance leap. Nitin Kumar at Qualcomm underscores their commitment to enhancing the PC user experience through power efficiency and performance optimization. The company also plans to integrate on-device AI into other products, such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Firefly, to further enhance user experience.

Despite past struggles with Intel, Qualcomm banks on the enthusiasm of PC makers. The company's commitment to improving power efficiency and performance optimization has been met with industry optimism, setting the stage for a potential shift in the laptop market in 2024.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Invesco QQQ Trust's heavy concentration in tech stocks raises volatility risk,https://in.investing.com/news/invesco-qqq-trusts-heavy-concentration-in-tech-stocks-raises-volatility-risk-93CH-3895076,"The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launched on March 10, 1999, and with net assets worth $195 billion, has been under scrutiny due to its high concentration in large tech stocks, which contributes to volatility risk and limits broad diversification.

It was noted that the fund's top ten holdings, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) class A and B, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ), account for about half of the fund's total assets. While the fund has a heavy concentration in tech stocks (57%), the Nasdaq-100 index it tracks is not purely a technology index but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare. This structure may not cater to investors seeking a tech-focused or broadly diversified investment.

Despite its low expense ratio of 0.2% and an annualized return of 8.95%, the fund's concentration in large stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26% of assets) creates volatility risk and hinders broad diversification.

In terms of performance, as of the end of the first three quarters of 2022, its annualized return was 8.95%, nearly identical to the index's return of 9.17%. This suggests that although Invesco QQQ is efficient and performs its intended function well by closely tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, it may not provide the potential for significant growth beyond what investing directly in the Nasdaq-100 index would yield.

While beneficial for investors seeking to mirror the index's performance, this close alignment can be a double-edged sword. It may not offer substantial returns for those seeking significant growth, raising questions about whether this ETF is a suitable choice for all types of investors.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Apple hit with a major setback in legal fight with EU,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-hit-with-a-major-setback-in-legal-fight-with-eu-432SI-3894958,"Europe's top court’s legal adviser has indicated that an EU tribunal committed legal errors in its ruling favoring Apple (NASDAQ: ) over a 13-billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order.

The adviser suggested that the case should be reviewed again, potentially posing a setback for Apple, Reuters reports.

In 2020, the European Union's General Court upheld Apple's challenge, asserting that regulators had not met the legal standard to demonstrate an unfair advantage.

However, Advocate General at the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) disagreed.

He suggested that CJEU judges should set aside the General Court ruling and refer the case back to the lower tribunal.

""The judgment of the General Court on 'tax rulings' adopted by Ireland in relation to Apple should be set aside,"" he stated in a non-binding opinion.

The CJEU, expected to rule in the coming months, typically follows about four in five such recommendations.

The tax case against Apple was part of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's efforts to address deals between multinationals and EU countries that were perceived as unfair state aid.

The European Commission, in its 2016 decision, contended that Apple benefited from Irish tax rulings, artificially reducing its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014."
2022-11-09, IANS,Europe’s top court advisor backs $14 bn tax case against Apple: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/europes-top-court-advisor-backs-14-bn-tax-case-against-apple-report-3894739,"London, Nov 9 (IANS) Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella, an adviser to Europe's top court, recommended on Thursday that an EU court make a new assessment in the 13 billion euros ($14-billion) tax case against Apple (NASDAQ: ).The opinion of Advocate General Pitruzzella is not binding on the court but is critical for the long-running case, according to reports.

The tax case against Apple, spearheaded by the EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, has significant implications for corporate tax liabilities.

In May this year, EU competition regulators appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to overturn a previous ruling and order Apple to pay a record-breaking $14 billion in Irish back taxes.

In July 2020, Apple scored a big win when Europe's second highest court rejected an EU order for the Cupertino-based iPhone maker to pay $15 billion in Irish back taxes.

The case goes back to August 2016 when the European Commission said that Apple benefited from illegal tax benefits in Ireland from 2003 to 2014.

In 2016, the EU ordered the iPhone maker to pay almost $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland as it believed Ireland had not been collecting enough taxes and instead had been giving companies like Apple too big of a break on its already low 12.5 per cent tax rate.

Apple reportedly moved its cash to the small island of Jersey off the south coast of England to avoid further Irish taxation.

IDC forecasts year-on-year sales growth in China for Q4 2022, which would be a significant turnaround after ten consecutive quarters of decline.

The optimism comes amid reports of strong demand from Chinese firms for Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s processors. The U.S. chipmaker's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor powers Xiaomi's Mi 14 series, indicating a fierce competition with Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Huawei.

On Oct 31, 2022, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun announced the launch of the Mi 14 series in China on Weibo (NASDAQ: ).

This surge in sales comes as China's smartphone market has been grappling with challenges intensified by U.S. export controls. However, the early success of Xiaomi's Mi 14 series and Huawei's Mate 60 series suggests a potential rebound for the industry as we move into the final quarter of the year.

2022-11-09, IANS,This is why iPhone 15 Pro Max costs $38 more than iPhone 14 Pro Max,https://in.investing.com/news/this-is-why-iphone-15-pro-max-costs-38-more-than-iphone-14-pro-max-3894287,"New Delhi, Nov 9 (IANS) The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s total bill of materials (BoM) cost cost is $37.7 higher than that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, a report showed on Thursday.The total BoM cost to produce an 8GB+256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max comes to $37.7 or 8 per cent higher than that for the 6GB+256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max launched last year, according to Counterpoint Research.

Share of Apple’s self-designed components has increased to 25 per cent of the total BoM cost, up from 22 per cent in the iPhone 14 Pro Max last year.

“With an increase of $100 in the starting retail price, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) more profit as it has the highest gross margin in the iPhone 15 family, despite being the costliest model,” the report mentioned.

Apple’s new-generation mobile platform, the A17 Pro, uses TSMC’s most advanced 3nm fabrication technology and packs more than 19 billion transistors in a die, 18 per cent more than that of the A16 Bionic.

The SoC upgrade has resulted in a cost increase of around $30 compared with the A16.

Another notable upgrade is the 5x telephoto camera featuring an equivalent 120mm focal length.

The overall cost of the camera system in the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 34 per cent costlier than that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the findings showed.

Apple has adopted a titanium alloy in the iPhone 15 Pro Max casing frame, which has reduced the device’s weight by around 20 g, making it the lightest Pro Max model ever.

The cost of the new casing in the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 18 per cent higher than that of the 14 Pro Max.

However, memory and display are among the areas where cost has fallen.

Apple has upgraded the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s DRAM to 8GB, which is 2GB higher than that of its predecessor.

However, the global memory market was in a downtrend from Q4 2022 to Q3 2022, both DRAM and NAND flash prices have decreased by more than 30 per cent.

This has worked in favor of Apple, helping it offset some of the other cost increases as the contribution of memory chips dropped by 34 per cent compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The display price is also in a downtrend. Apart from Samsung (KS: ) Display, LG Display has also started supplying iPhone LTPO displays.

“This has contributed to a reduction in display costs by 4 per cent in the iPhone 15 Pro Max compared to that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max,” said the report.

“Apple has grown to a level where it has significant control over design, innovation, scalability, costs and profits of the entire iPhone and the other products in its portfolio,” the report said.

As per the Form 13F filings with the SEC, between January 2022 and October 2022, Berkshire acquired a substantial 228 million-share stake in the company. The move reflects Buffett's anticipation of persistent high prices due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and reduced capital expenditure amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The investment in Occidental Petroleum is in addition to Buffett's consistent investment in tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), which makes up nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's $343 billion invested assets. Buffett praises Apple as superior to any other business they own.

However, it is noteworthy that Buffett's most favored investment remains his own company. Following the simplification of the share buyback process on July 17, 2018, he has dedicated over $72 billion to repurchase Berkshire Hathaway shares. This strategy increases the Earnings Per Share (EPS) over time by reducing outstanding shares, enhancing the stock's appeal to long-term investors.

Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has achieved an aggregate return of 4,300,000% in its Class A shares (BRK.A) since 1965. His investment strategies continue to be closely watched by investors worldwide.

The company's cash reserve also hit a historical peak, reaching $157.2 billion. These results reflect the firm's strategic approach to capitalizing on rising bond yields by investing in short-term Treasury bills, which pushed Berkshire's holdings to $126.4 billion.

Despite these positive developments, the company's share buyback program witnessed a slowdown, with only $1.1 billion spent in Q3. This coincided with a 6% drop in its Class A shares from their September peak, even though they have increased by 14% this year.

In terms of portfolio performance, Geico, a significant part of Berkshire's insurance portfolio, reported underwriting profits of $1.1 billion. Conversely, BNSF Railway experienced a 15% profit drop due to decreased freight volumes and higher costs.

Berkshire also suffered an investment loss of $24.1 billion in Q3, largely attributable to a decrease in Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock value.

Berkshire Hathaway has consistently surpassed the 's performance and reached a market cap of $762 billion since its inception in 1965. This growth is attributed to organic expansion and strategic acquisitions like Pilot Travel Centers in 2022 that have substantially boosted revenues.

While fluctuating investment and derivative gains have led to inconsistent profits and cash flows over the years, the company's resilience and high-quality operations have navigated these complexities effectively. Despite trading at higher multiples than in previous years, Berkshire Hathaway's consistent performance and ability to handle challenges have heightened its appeal to long-term investors.

“iPhone 15 Pro Max's Night Mode is impressive. After focusing the subject, we should be able to keep the phone steady for the Night Mode to do its job for the time being displayed. This enables crisp photographs even in low light conditions,” he told IANS.

The portrait mode is stunning in iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new 5x Optical Zoom which is equivalent to a 120mm telephoto lens.

“One can capture details of lamps in low light and beautiful portraits of loved ones with the natural light of lamps. Final results will be breathtaking,” Basra added.

With festive season around, one can capture beautiful videos of well-lit surroundings using the iPhone's main 48MP camera to capture the utmost details possible. One can also experiment the Cinematic Mode (4K HDR) and capture the beautiful emotions of loved ones during Diwali, according to him.

Travel photographer and filmmaker Siddhartha Joshi recommends shooting with the standard wide lens (1x) as it captures more light and will give the best results.

""Shoot in Apple (NASDAQ: ) RAW if you want to capture maximum details and process the image later on an editing software. Night shots will always have more noise. A great way to get around this is to use ambient light on your subject as you have plenty of thrust on Diwali - this could be diyas, lights or candles,” Joshi told IANS.

The additional light will help bring out the subject better. If you are shooting videos, there might be flicker when shooting with all the beautiful electrical lights at home.

“To eliminate this, go to camera settings, activate ‘show PAL format’, and then shoot your videos at 25 fps (frames per second). Diwali is a festival of lights and while you move around, the colour of lights in your frame will change and so will the white balance. It’s best to lock the white balance in camera settings to get a seamless video,” he explained.

Currently, there are special Diwali offer from Apple online and at Apple stores in BKC (Mumbai) and Saket (Delhi).

One can buy iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus and get up to 50 per cent off on AirPods plus free Apple Music for 6 months this festive season.

The GM credit card was launched less than two years ago as part of Goldman Sachs' consumer lending venture, targeting GM vehicle owners.

This move comes after the bank sold its personal finance unit to Creative Planning in August 2022 and specialty lender GreenSky to Sixth Street Partners and other firms in early October. The sale of GreenSky followed a 33% fall in third-quarter profits from last year, largely due to a Greensky (NASDAQ: ) write-down that reduced pre-tax profits by nearly $1 billion.

In addition to the GM credit card, Goldman Sachs is also considering exiting the credit card business it launched with Apple (NASDAQ: ) in 2019. Talks have been held with American Express (NYSE:NYSE: ) about potentially taking over both these programs. CEO David Solomon stated on the third-quarter earnings call that Goldman Sachs does not have the unilateral right to exit these long-term contracts but emphasized on managing them better for drag reduction and profitability progress.

The retreat from consumer business began under Solomon's leadership. In October 2020, Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions division outbid Barclays (LON: ) to acquire the GM credit card business from Capital One for $2.5 billion. The bank also acquired fintech lender and 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) provider GreenSky in 2021 for $2.24 billion, only to sell it two years later.

These strategic shifts come as Goldman Sachs grapples with a slump in the dealmaking market while trying to streamline operations and improve profitability.

The company reported a 28% annual revenue increase in its first post-IPO earnings report on Wednesday. However, shares fell by over 7% due to lower-than-expected revenue guidance.

Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, Arm achieved breakthrough success when the Arm610 processor powered Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Newton device in 1993. Today, it licenses its architecture to CPU manufacturers and collects royalties from each chip shipped with its technology. Despite a slump in smartphone sales and geopolitical risks with China, which accounts for 20% of its revenue, Arm is making strides in the laptop market through a partnership with Apple and is experiencing growth in the automotive industry due to the rise of self-driving capabilities and partnerships with companies like Cruise.

In response to the global chip shortage highlighting Arm's critical role in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) announced its latest Grace Hopper Superchip. This couples Nvidia's GPUs with Arm's Neoverse cores, underscoring Arm's influence in high-performance computing.

Arm is also involved in a legal dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) over chip production rights following Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Furthermore, there is significant controversy surrounding Arm China, an independent entity majority-owned by Chinese investors embroiled in a leadership dispute. Former Arm China employees have started a new internal chip design company with backing from Shenzhen's government.

Despite these challenges, Arm has diversified into emerging markets including AI and has launched its Neoverse line for high-performance and cloud computing applications. The company has partnerships with major tech companies including Apple, Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). However, a labor shortage at TSMC is affecting its $40 billion fab under construction.

Arm's primary competitor remains Intel's x86 architecture. However, software componentization is making it easier for other architectures like Arm to run on servers. It also faces competition from RISC-V, an open-source rival architecture gaining traction among key customers like Google and Samsung.

Despite a failed acquisition attempt by Nvidia and challenges such as declining smartphone sales, Arm continues to evolve and is positioning itself as a crucial player in the future of computing.

The announcement was made Today, with the chip surpassing the performance per watt and power efficiency of Apple (NASDAQ: ) M2 and Intel (NASDAQ: ) chips. The Snapdragon X Elite chip is designed with integrated generative AI, aligning with the increasing trend of integrating neural processing units into every chip.

The new chip was unveiled by Qualcomm's Alex Katouzian at the Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii in October 2022. Anshel Sag of Moor Insights and Strategy expressed that this innovation could pose a significant challenge to Intel and AMD (NASDAQ: ). Black Magic also demonstrated how their DaVinci Resolve Studio software could utilize the AI capabilities of the X Elite chip to further improve performance.

In addition to its superior performance, the Snapdragon X Elite chip is designed for unique applications. Qualcomm expects that laptops powered by this new chip, targeting creators and casual gamers, will launch in mid-2024. These laptops are expected to have a substantial impact on PC performance due to their on-the-go computing capabilities and intensive task handling.

Despite the upcoming release of Apple's more potent M3-based Macs and the incumbency advantages of Intel and AMD, Techsponential's analysis supports industry optimism about Qualcomm's success. Kedar Kondap at Qualcomm anticipates the release of the first laptops powered by the Snapdragon X Elite, emphasizing that on-device AI, like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Copilot, will attract consumers across industries.

As Qualcomm prepares for the X Elite launch in December 2022, Intel plans to release its Meteor Lake laptop processor. Avi Greengart from Techsponential points out Intel's advantages but acknowledges Qualcomm's significant performance leap. Nitin Kumar at Qualcomm underscores their commitment to enhancing the PC user experience through power efficiency and performance optimization. The company also plans to integrate on-device AI into other products, such as Adobe (NASDAQ: ) Firefly, to further enhance user experience.

Despite past struggles with Intel, Qualcomm banks on the enthusiasm of PC makers. The company's commitment to improving power efficiency and performance optimization has been met with industry optimism, setting the stage for a potential shift in the laptop market in 2024.

It was noted that the fund's top ten holdings, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) class A and B, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ), account for about half of the fund's total assets. While the fund has a heavy concentration in tech stocks (57%), the Nasdaq-100 index it tracks is not purely a technology index but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare. This structure may not cater to investors seeking a tech-focused or broadly diversified investment.

Despite its low expense ratio of 0.2% and an annualized return of 8.95%, the fund's concentration in large stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26% of assets) creates volatility risk and hinders broad diversification.

In terms of performance, as of the end of the first three quarters of 2022, its annualized return was 8.95%, nearly identical to the index's return of 9.17%. This suggests that although Invesco QQQ is efficient and performs its intended function well by closely tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, it may not provide the potential for significant growth beyond what investing directly in the Nasdaq-100 index would yield.

While beneficial for investors seeking to mirror the index's performance, this close alignment can be a double-edged sword. It may not offer substantial returns for those seeking significant growth, raising questions about whether this ETF is a suitable choice for all types of investors.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Apple hit with a major setback in legal fight with EU,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-hit-with-a-major-setback-in-legal-fight-with-eu-432SI-3894958,"Europe's top court’s legal adviser has indicated that an EU tribunal committed legal errors in its ruling favoring Apple (NASDAQ: ) over a 13-billion-euro ($14 billion) tax order.

The adviser suggested that the case should be reviewed again, potentially posing a setback for Apple, Reuters reports.

In 2020, the European Union's General Court upheld Apple's challenge, asserting that regulators had not met the legal standard to demonstrate an unfair advantage.

However, Advocate General at the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) disagreed.

He suggested that CJEU judges should set aside the General Court ruling and refer the case back to the lower tribunal.

""The judgment of the General Court on 'tax rulings' adopted by Ireland in relation to Apple should be set aside,"" he stated in a non-binding opinion.

The CJEU, expected to rule in the coming months, typically follows about four in five such recommendations.

The tax case against Apple was part of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's efforts to address deals between multinationals and EU countries that were perceived as unfair state aid.

The European Commission, in its 2016 decision, contended that Apple benefited from Irish tax rulings, artificially reducing its tax burden to as low as 0.005% in 2014."
2022-11-09, IANS,Europe’s top court advisor backs $14 bn tax case against Apple: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/europes-top-court-advisor-backs-14-bn-tax-case-against-apple-report-3894739,"London, Nov 9 (IANS) Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella, an adviser to Europe's top court, recommended on Thursday that an EU court make a new assessment in the 13 billion euros ($14-billion) tax case against Apple (NASDAQ: ).The opinion of Advocate General Pitruzzella is not binding on the court but is critical for the long-running case, according to reports.

The tax case against Apple, spearheaded by the EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, has significant implications for corporate tax liabilities.

In May this year, EU competition regulators appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to overturn a previous ruling and order Apple to pay a record-breaking $14 billion in Irish back taxes.

In July 2020, Apple scored a big win when Europe's second highest court rejected an EU order for the Cupertino-based iPhone maker to pay $15 billion in Irish back taxes.

The case goes back to August 2016 when the European Commission said that Apple benefited from illegal tax benefits in Ireland from 2003 to 2014.

In 2016, the EU ordered the iPhone maker to pay almost $15 billion in back taxes to Ireland as it believed Ireland had not been collecting enough taxes and instead had been giving companies like Apple too big of a break on its already low 12.5 per cent tax rate.

Apple reportedly moved its cash to the small island of Jersey off the south coast of England to avoid further Irish taxation.

2022-11-09, IANS,This is why iPhone 15 Pro Max costs $38 more than iPhone 14 Pro Max,https://in.investing.com/news/this-is-why-iphone-15-pro-max-costs-38-more-than-iphone-14-pro-max-3894287,"New Delhi, Nov 9 (IANS) The iPhone 15 Pro Max’s total bill of materials (BoM) cost cost is $37.7 higher than that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, a report showed on Thursday.The total BoM cost to produce an 8GB+256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max comes to $37.7 or 8 per cent higher than that for the 6GB+256GB iPhone 14 Pro Max launched last year, according to Counterpoint Research.

Share of Apple’s self-designed components has increased to 25 per cent of the total BoM cost, up from 22 per cent in the iPhone 14 Pro Max last year.

“With an increase of $100 in the starting retail price, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is expected to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) more profit as it has the highest gross margin in the iPhone 15 family, despite being the costliest model,” the report mentioned.

Apple’s new-generation mobile platform, the A17 Pro, uses TSMC’s most advanced 3nm fabrication technology and packs more than 19 billion transistors in a die, 18 per cent more than that of the A16 Bionic.

The SoC upgrade has resulted in a cost increase of around $30 compared with the A16.

Another notable upgrade is the 5x telephoto camera featuring an equivalent 120mm focal length.

The overall cost of the camera system in the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 34 per cent costlier than that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max, the findings showed.

Apple has adopted a titanium alloy in the iPhone 15 Pro Max casing frame, which has reduced the device’s weight by around 20 g, making it the lightest Pro Max model ever.

The cost of the new casing in the iPhone 15 Pro Max is 18 per cent higher than that of the 14 Pro Max.

However, memory and display are among the areas where cost has fallen.

Apple has upgraded the iPhone 15 Pro Max’s DRAM to 8GB, which is 2GB higher than that of its predecessor.

However, the global memory market was in a downtrend from Q4 2022 to Q3 2022, both DRAM and NAND flash prices have decreased by more than 30 per cent.

This has worked in favor of Apple, helping it offset some of the other cost increases as the contribution of memory chips dropped by 34 per cent compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.

The display price is also in a downtrend. Apart from Samsung (KS: ) Display, LG Display has also started supplying iPhone LTPO displays.

“This has contributed to a reduction in display costs by 4 per cent in the iPhone 15 Pro Max compared to that of the iPhone 14 Pro Max,” said the report.

“Apple has grown to a level where it has significant control over design, innovation, scalability, costs and profits of the entire iPhone and the other products in its portfolio,” the report said.

As per the Form 13F filings with the SEC, between January 2022 and October 2022, Berkshire acquired a substantial 228 million-share stake in the company. The move reflects Buffett's anticipation of persistent high prices due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and reduced capital expenditure amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The investment in Occidental Petroleum is in addition to Buffett's consistent investment in tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), which makes up nearly half of Berkshire Hathaway's $343 billion invested assets. Buffett praises Apple as superior to any other business they own.

However, it is noteworthy that Buffett's most favored investment remains his own company. Following the simplification of the share buyback process on July 17, 2018, he has dedicated over $72 billion to repurchase Berkshire Hathaway shares. This strategy increases the Earnings Per Share (EPS) over time by reducing outstanding shares, enhancing the stock's appeal to long-term investors.

Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire Hathaway has achieved an aggregate return of 4,300,000% in its Class A shares (BRK.A) since 1965. His investment strategies continue to be closely watched by investors worldwide.

The company's cash reserve also hit a historical peak, reaching $157.2 billion. These results reflect the firm's strategic approach to capitalizing on rising bond yields by investing in short-term Treasury bills, which pushed Berkshire's holdings to $126.4 billion.

Despite these positive developments, the company's share buyback program witnessed a slowdown, with only $1.1 billion spent in Q3. This coincided with a 6% drop in its Class A shares from their September peak, even though they have increased by 14% this year.

In terms of portfolio performance, Geico, a significant part of Berkshire's insurance portfolio, reported underwriting profits of $1.1 billion. Conversely, BNSF Railway experienced a 15% profit drop due to decreased freight volumes and higher costs.

Berkshire also suffered an investment loss of $24.1 billion in Q3, largely attributable to a decrease in Apple (NASDAQ: )'s stock value.

Berkshire Hathaway has consistently surpassed the 's performance and reached a market cap of $762 billion since its inception in 1965. This growth is attributed to organic expansion and strategic acquisitions like Pilot Travel Centers in 2022 that have substantially boosted revenues.

While fluctuating investment and derivative gains have led to inconsistent profits and cash flows over the years, the company's resilience and high-quality operations have navigated these complexities effectively. Despite trading at higher multiples than in previous years, Berkshire Hathaway's consistent performance and ability to handle challenges have heightened its appeal to long-term investors.

“iPhone 15 Pro Max's Night Mode is impressive. After focusing the subject, we should be able to keep the phone steady for the Night Mode to do its job for the time being displayed. This enables crisp photographs even in low light conditions,” he told IANS.

The portrait mode is stunning in iPhone 15 Pro Max with the new 5x Optical Zoom which is equivalent to a 120mm telephoto lens.

“One can capture details of lamps in low light and beautiful portraits of loved ones with the natural light of lamps. Final results will be breathtaking,” Basra added.

With festive season around, one can capture beautiful videos of well-lit surroundings using the iPhone's main 48MP camera to capture the utmost details possible. One can also experiment the Cinematic Mode (4K HDR) and capture the beautiful emotions of loved ones during Diwali, according to him.

Travel photographer and filmmaker Siddhartha Joshi recommends shooting with the standard wide lens (1x) as it captures more light and will give the best results.

""Shoot in Apple (NASDAQ: ) RAW if you want to capture maximum details and process the image later on an editing software. Night shots will always have more noise. A great way to get around this is to use ambient light on your subject as you have plenty of thrust on Diwali - this could be diyas, lights or candles,” Joshi told IANS.

The additional light will help bring out the subject better. If you are shooting videos, there might be flicker when shooting with all the beautiful electrical lights at home.

“To eliminate this, go to camera settings, activate ‘show PAL format’, and then shoot your videos at 25 fps (frames per second). Diwali is a festival of lights and while you move around, the colour of lights in your frame will change and so will the white balance. It’s best to lock the white balance in camera settings to get a seamless video,” he explained.

Currently, there are special Diwali offer from Apple online and at Apple stores in BKC (Mumbai) and Saket (Delhi).

One can buy iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus and get up to 50 per cent off on AirPods plus free Apple Music for 6 months this festive season.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Google faces second major U.S. antitrust trial over Play Store monopoly allegations,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-second-major-us-antitrust-trial-over-play-store-monopoly-allegations-93CH-3888739,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google is embroiled in its second major antitrust trial in the United States, initiated by Fortnite creator Epic Games. The case, expected to conclude before Christmas, is centered around allegations of Google's monopolistic control over Android app distribution via its Play Store. The trial follows a similar lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) earlier this year, which resulted in apps being allowed to offer alternative payment options, potentially destabilizing tech giants' commission structures.

The proceedings kicked off with Epic Games accusing Google of creating an illegal monopoly on Android apps to boost profits through commissions on in-app purchases, which vary between 15% and 30%. Google's defense team countered the allegations, asserting that the company faces substantial competition from mobile and video game console stores, including Apple's app store.

Epic Games claims that Google employs a ""bribe and block"" strategy to discourage competition and complicate downloading Android apps from other outlets. Google defends these tactics as safety measures and justifies the commission system as necessary for maintaining an operating system powering billions of smartphones globally. The defense suggests that Epic aims to boost its profit by avoiding a payment system that diverts revenue from popular games like Fortnite.

The trial will feature testimonies from Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. Concurrently, the U.S. Justice Department is challenging Google's internet search dominance for alleged power abuse.

This legal challenge is part of Epic Games' ""Project Liberty"", an initiative aimed at app store transaction fees. The lawsuit follows Epic's 2021 case against Apple and accuses Google of using its control over Android and the Play Store to squeeze excessive profits from app developers.

Despite these allegations, Google recently settled antitrust claims with state attorneys general and Match Group (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Tinder. However, the Play Store continues to play a crucial role in services licensed to Android phone manufacturers and serves as a major entry point for Google's search engine.

Epic's lawsuits have drawn scrutiny from global regulators, notably in South Korea, home to Samsung Electronics (KS: ) - Google's largest mobile partner. In response to these concerns and as part of its efforts to appease large app developers such as Spotify (NYSE: ), Google has allowed alternative payment systems in the Play Store. Despite these changes and the popularity of Epic's Fortnite game on the platform, Alphabet reported a decline in Play Store revenue last year due to fee changes and decreased spending.

This comes as the company remains optimistic about the recovery of film supply, even in light of Warner Bros.' delayed ""Dune: Part Two"" premiere.

Benchmark analysts project a robust recovery for the domestic box office, anticipating it to reach $3 billion. This projection is bolstered by a predicted 30% growth due to increased film production from both legacy studios and tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Despite Cinemark's shares experiencing recent dips, Benchmark maintains its buy rating for the company. This stance is based on Cinemark's improved financials and the potential reinstatement of its dividend in 2024.

On the other hand, shares of AMC Entertainment (NYSE: ) Holdings Inc., often dubbed as a meme-stock darling, experienced an uptick following Cinemark's positive earnings announcement. However, a FactSet survey revealed mixed analyst ratings for Cinemark, indicating differing views on the company's prospects.

As Cinemark continues to navigate post-pandemic recovery, it remains to be seen how these projections will play out in the face of ongoing industry challenges and uncertainties.

InvestingPro Insights

This is in line with one of the InvestingPro Tips, suggesting the company is trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth.

InvestingPro also highlights that Cinemark's revenue growth has been slowing down recently, a fact corroborated by a 20.06% increase in Revenue over the last twelve months as of Q3 2022.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway registers Q3 loss amid strong operating earnings and record cash reserves,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-registers-q3-loss-amid-strong-operating-earnings-and-record-cash-reserves-93CH-3887240,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) reported a challenging third quarter, marked by a $23.5 billion investment loss, largely due to declining stakes in Apple (NASDAQ: ), American Express (NYSE: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), and Bank of America (NYSE: ). The strategic sale of over 12 million Chevron (NYSE: ) shares ahead of its Hess (NYSE: ) acquisition further affected the portfolio value, causing it to drop from $353 billion to $319 billion.

Despite these setbacks, the conglomerate managed to report a 40.6% surge in Q3 operating earnings to $10.761 billion. This was driven by rising interest rates that benefited its insurance businesses like Geico and BNSF Railway. These businesses generated $1.7 billion in interest income, which helped boost operating income to nearly $11 billion.

The company also reported an unprecedented cash reserve of $157.2 billion, propelled by Buffett's strategy of acquiring high-yield short-term Treasury bills and amassing holdings of $126.4 billion. Charlie Munger hinted at a potential major acquisition in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, which could be a strategic move utilizing this record cash reserve.

However, despite soaring share prices, the company's share buyback program slowed down, with just $1.1 billion spent in Q3. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares appreciated nearly 14% this year but experienced a 6% slump from their September peak.

Among its portfolio companies, Geico reported strong underwriting earnings of $1.1 billion. In contrast, BNSF Railway faced a 15% profit drop due to dwindling freight volumes and escalating costs.

The decline was felt across industry giants Samsung (KS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and TCL, which saw their shipments fall by 26%, 37%, and 51% respectively. Apple (NASDAQ: )'s shipments also took a hit, decreasing by 11%, largely due to the delayed release of the iPhone 15 series, according to analysts.

On the other hand, Motorola (NYSE: ) and Nokia (HE: ) HMD managed to buck the trend, witnessing shipment growth of 31% and 17% respectively. Despite robust promotions from carriers, upgrade rates hit near-record lows as consumers chose to retain their devices for longer periods.

However, new entrants in the market such as foldable smartphones are emerging as potential catalysts for a market rebound. Devices like Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, OnePlus's first foldable smartphone, and Motorola Razr 2022 are gaining traction among consumers, noted the analysts.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2022, a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates is expected. Counterpoint analysts predict that this rebound will be driven in part by a large base of iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users likely to switch to the iPhone 15 series. However, they anticipate that upgrade rates will remain lower than those of the previous year. All information was sourced from IANS.

“With no dramatic improvements in macroeconomic conditions, project and purchase delays are expected to be pushed further into 2024,"" said Anuroopa Nataraj, senior research analyst with IDC.

“Refresh in the education segment and growth in use cases across verticals might help the tablet market to stay afloat in the long run, but in the near future we don’t expect any significant uptick in tablet sales,” Nataraj added.

Despite constricted demand, the market saw an upsurge of 18 per cent over the previous quarter due to seasonality.

Meanwhile, Chromebook shipments also contracted in 3Q23 with shipments totalling 3.5 million units for a year-over-year decline of 20.8 per cent.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the tablet market with shipments of 12.5 million units yet declined 15.1 per cent.

Unlike past years, Apple has forgone the launch of new models during the third quarter, which typically provides an uplift in the second half of the year. However, not all is lost as Apple has been able to maintain share since last year, said the report.

""Tablets have unfortunately always found themselves in an awkward middle ground between PCs and smartphones, and this continues to put downward pressure on the market,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager with IDC.

Apple’s shipments were down 11 per cent compared to Q3 2022, part of which is attributable to the later launch date of the iPhone 15 series compared to the iPhone 14 series, which pushed some shipments into Q4 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

“While upgrade rates were slightly up at the carriers when compared to last quarter, they remained much below their usual levels as consumers opted to hold on to their devices for longer instead of upgrading,” said research analyst Matthew Orf.

Foldables are a potential bright spot in the US smartphone market, with increasing number of Android foldables options.

“Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 5 in August, while OnePlus launched its first foldable and Motorola launched the sub-$900 Motorola Raz 2022 in early Q4 2022,” said senior research analyst Maurice Klaehne.

Despite the carriers continuing to offer strong promotions through the quarter, upgrade rates at the carriers remained near record lows.

“We expect a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates during the fourth quarter, but they are likely to remain lower than in the same period last year.

This daemon runs in the background to collect liquid detection analysis from each USB-C port on the Mac, the report mentioned.

This feature is described as a “Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon.”

iPhones and iPads have a similar daemon to alert users when liquid is detected in the connector.

On the Mac, the code suggests that the daemon is only used for “analytics” and is not associated with end-user features.

Apple may finally implement an alert similar to the iOS for Mac users too.

Apple’s limited warranty doesn’t cover damage caused by liquids, even for water-resistant products like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and some AirPods models.

macOS Sonoma 14.1 is the first major update to Apple’s new operating system. The update includes a number of new features and bug fixes.

Like on the iPhones, users can now favourite songs, albums, and playlists in the Music app. Favourited items can be easily filtered and accessed in the library.

Second-placed Samsung (KS: ) shipped 6.2 million tablets, down 6 per cent while Lenovo shipped 2.6 million tablets to hold onto third place.

Huawei and Xiaomi took fourth and fifth place, respectively, with the latter making its debut in the top five with the highest growth of the major vendors, according to the report by market research firm Canalys.

Chromebook shipments fell 19 per cent to 3.5 million in Q3 because much of the back-to-school inventory cleared through the channel.

Acer regained first place in Chromebook shipments with a relatively low drop of 16 per cent compared with Q2, but shipments still fell 17 per cent year-over-year.

Meanwhile, second-placed HP faced a larger sequential drop of 57% after previously taking the top spot. Dell maintained third place, with its Q3 shipments roughly matching HP’s. Lenovo and Asus took the final places in the top five rankings.

“With inventories stabilising, tablet shipments are starting to increase sequentially. This bodes well for the upcoming holiday season, where continued discounting and new product launches are set to drive the market back to year-on-year growth,” said Himani Mukka, Research Manager at Canalys.

Additionally, tablet vendors must start prioritising the integration of generative AI capabilities into their devices to maintain a competitive edge.

“Leading players Apple and Samsung have already signalled greater intent around incorporating AI experiences across their hardware portfolios,” Mukka added.

Chromebooks’ growth trajectory rapidly changed for the worse in Q3 as shipments fell 40 per cent quarter on quarter.

Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade.

The update includes a system that can detect liquids in USB-C ports on Mac laptops, a move that supplements existing Liquid Contact Indicators (LCI) present in these devices and specific Apple keyboards.

The new tool, named ""liquiddetectiond,"" operates silently in the background, collecting and analyzing data from each USB-C port. This ""Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon"" primarily aids in data collection and analytics, rather than providing user notifications as similar systems do in iPhones and iPads.

The introduction of this feature is part of Apple's strategy to curtail unwarranted warranty claims and ensure a fair and accurate warranty process. Currently, Apple's warranty policy excludes coverage for damages resulting from accidental liquid exposure, even for water-resistant products such as iPhone, Apple Watch, and certain AirPod models.

The collected data from the ""liquiddetectiond"" daemon informs technicians' decisions about whether a Mac qualifies for free repair following accidental liquid exposure. It remains unclear whether this daemon is compatible with all Mac models or exclusively M3 Macs due to hardware requirements.

This move by Apple represents an advancement in their liquid damage detection strategy. It is expected to enhance the precision of liquid exposure assessments, helping technicians more accurately determine warranty eligibility for gratis repairs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) surpassed Wall Street's fourth-quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings per share (EPS) predictions, posting $1.46 versus the consensus estimate of $1.39. The tech giant also reported a slightly higher revenue of $89.5 billion, a 0.7% year-on-year decrease, beating the projected figure of $89.34 billion. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing top-line growth.

Despite the better-than-expected results, Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) declined in premarket trading following the company's tepid current quarter guidance issued post-September results. This prompted Wall Street to revise its price target for Apple to $185 from a previous higher value, reflecting softer product demand but interest near $165 due to slower December quarter growth.

The company's forecast for stagnant holiday quarter revenue is attributed to a downturn in the Chinese market, triggered by government actions and increasing competition from Huawei's new phone offering. Consequently, Apple's revenue from China decreased to $15.1 billion, falling short of the predicted $17 billion.

In terms of product sales, Apple anticipates an increase in iPhone revenue for the current quarter, backed by comments from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and recent monthly revenue data from Taiwan Semiconductor. The expected growth in iPhone sales and the Mac refresh are likely to offset a sharp drop in iPad and wearables sales, notably in the smartwatch line.

Apple's Services sector, which is its second-largest business, is projected to grow ""strong double digits,"" following a 16% YoY rise in the September quarter. With over 1 billion paid subscribers, price hikes across Apple's Services business are expected to ensure steady revenue and EPS generation.

Despite CEO Tim Cook pointing out record revenues in India, China's slowdown poses a significant headwind for Apple's performance. However, any normalization of US-China relations could potentially enhance global economic sentiment and the shares of Apple and other tech companies like Micron (NASDAQ: ).

The new rule would affect companies that process over five million financial transactions annually, which currently includes approximately 17 firms.

The CFPB's director, Rohit Chopra, has been advocating for increased regulatory scrutiny of large technology companies due to potential concerns related to ""surveillance and censorship."" He views these payment systems as a crucial component of the economy.

In September, the CFPB released a report highlighting how Apple and Google utilize their dominant position in the mobile phone market to promote their own digital wallets. Consumers transacted $893 billion through these services in 2020. While the adoption of digital payments in the U.S. has been slower compared to other countries, the pandemic has significantly accelerated its usage.

Currently, the CFPB's jurisdiction over electronic fund transfers gives it enforcement powers over digital payment companies. However, the proposed rule would bolster its supervisory oversight, providing a more detailed insight into the operations of major market participants.

CEO Michael Saylor, in an interview with Fox Business, credited the company's Bitcoin holdings for this impressive growth. The company recently celebrated three years of Bitcoin purchasing by adding another 155 Bitcoins worth $5.3 million to its portfolio.

The firm now holds a total of 158,400 Bitcoins purchased at an average price of $29,586 per coin. In the third quarter alone, MicroStrategy bought 6,067 Bitcoins at an average cost of $27,531 each.

Among these tech giants, only Tesla holds Bitcoin according to its recent quarterly filings. Despite this, MicroStrategy has outperformed all these companies' returns.

This strategy involves incorporating Bitcoin into balance sheets to escape the costly cycle of acquisitions, stock buybacks, dividends, and debt.

Saylor expressed optimism about Bitcoin's future growth due to the upcoming 2024 halving and potential demand surge from spot ETFs. He showcased Bitcoin's extraordinary performance and capital safeguarding potential with an asset class total returns chart showing a staggering return of 1,120,785% from 2011 to 2022.

The CEO's bullish stance on Bitcoin extends beyond its potential for capital growth. He views it as a high-tech network growing at 40-50% annually and as a crucial tool for capital preservation.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Google faces second major U.S. antitrust trial over Play Store monopoly allegations,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-second-major-us-antitrust-trial-over-play-store-monopoly-allegations-93CH-3888739,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google is embroiled in its second major antitrust trial in the United States, initiated by Fortnite creator Epic Games. The case, expected to conclude before Christmas, is centered around allegations of Google's monopolistic control over Android app distribution via its Play Store. The trial follows a similar lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) earlier this year, which resulted in apps being allowed to offer alternative payment options, potentially destabilizing tech giants' commission structures.

The proceedings kicked off with Epic Games accusing Google of creating an illegal monopoly on Android apps to boost profits through commissions on in-app purchases, which vary between 15% and 30%. Google's defense team countered the allegations, asserting that the company faces substantial competition from mobile and video game console stores, including Apple's app store.

Epic Games claims that Google employs a ""bribe and block"" strategy to discourage competition and complicate downloading Android apps from other outlets. Google defends these tactics as safety measures and justifies the commission system as necessary for maintaining an operating system powering billions of smartphones globally. The defense suggests that Epic aims to boost its profit by avoiding a payment system that diverts revenue from popular games like Fortnite.

The trial will feature testimonies from Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. Concurrently, the U.S. Justice Department is challenging Google's internet search dominance for alleged power abuse.

This legal challenge is part of Epic Games' ""Project Liberty"", an initiative aimed at app store transaction fees. The lawsuit follows Epic's 2021 case against Apple and accuses Google of using its control over Android and the Play Store to squeeze excessive profits from app developers.

Despite these allegations, Google recently settled antitrust claims with state attorneys general and Match Group (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Tinder. However, the Play Store continues to play a crucial role in services licensed to Android phone manufacturers and serves as a major entry point for Google's search engine.

Epic's lawsuits have drawn scrutiny from global regulators, notably in South Korea, home to Samsung Electronics (KS: ) - Google's largest mobile partner. In response to these concerns and as part of its efforts to appease large app developers such as Spotify (NYSE: ), Google has allowed alternative payment systems in the Play Store. Despite these changes and the popularity of Epic's Fortnite game on the platform, Alphabet reported a decline in Play Store revenue last year due to fee changes and decreased spending.

The strategic sale of over 12 million Chevron (NYSE: ) shares ahead of its Hess (NYSE: ) acquisition further affected the portfolio value, causing it to drop from $353 billion to $319 billion.

Despite these setbacks, the conglomerate managed to report a 40.6% surge in Q3 operating earnings to $10.761 billion. This was driven by rising interest rates that benefited its insurance businesses like Geico and BNSF Railway. These businesses generated $1.7 billion in interest income, which helped boost operating income to nearly $11 billion.

The company also reported an unprecedented cash reserve of $157.2 billion, propelled by Buffett's strategy of acquiring high-yield short-term Treasury bills and amassing holdings of $126.4 billion. Charlie Munger hinted at a potential major acquisition in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, which could be a strategic move utilizing this record cash reserve.

However, despite soaring share prices, the company's share buyback program slowed down, with just $1.1 billion spent in Q3. Berkshire Hathaway's Class A shares appreciated nearly 14% this year but experienced a 6% slump from their September peak.

Among its portfolio companies, Geico reported strong underwriting earnings of $1.1 billion. In contrast, BNSF Railway faced a 15% profit drop due to dwindling freight volumes and escalating costs.

The decline was felt across industry giants Samsung (KS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and TCL, which saw their shipments fall by 26%, 37%, and 51% respectively. Apple (NASDAQ: )'s shipments also took a hit, decreasing by 11%, largely due to the delayed release of the iPhone 15 series, according to analysts.

On the other hand, Motorola (NYSE: ) and Nokia (HE: ) HMD managed to buck the trend, witnessing shipment growth of 31% and 17% respectively. Despite robust promotions from carriers, upgrade rates hit near-record lows as consumers chose to retain their devices for longer periods.

However, new entrants in the market such as foldable smartphones are emerging as potential catalysts for a market rebound. Devices like Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, OnePlus's first foldable smartphone, and Motorola Razr 2022 are gaining traction among consumers, noted the analysts.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2022, a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates is expected. Counterpoint analysts predict that this rebound will be driven in part by a large base of iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users likely to switch to the iPhone 15 series. However, they anticipate that upgrade rates will remain lower than those of the previous year. All information was sourced from IANS.

“With no dramatic improvements in macroeconomic conditions, project and purchase delays are expected to be pushed further into 2024,"" said Anuroopa Nataraj, senior research analyst with IDC.

“Refresh in the education segment and growth in use cases across verticals might help the tablet market to stay afloat in the long run, but in the near future we don’t expect any significant uptick in tablet sales,” Nataraj added.

Despite constricted demand, the market saw an upsurge of 18 per cent over the previous quarter due to seasonality.

Meanwhile, Chromebook shipments also contracted in 3Q23 with shipments totalling 3.5 million units for a year-over-year decline of 20.8 per cent.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the tablet market with shipments of 12.5 million units yet declined 15.1 per cent.

Unlike past years, Apple has forgone the launch of new models during the third quarter, which typically provides an uplift in the second half of the year. However, not all is lost as Apple has been able to maintain share since last year, said the report.

""Tablets have unfortunately always found themselves in an awkward middle ground between PCs and smartphones, and this continues to put downward pressure on the market,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager with IDC.

Apple’s shipments were down 11 per cent compared to Q3 2022, part of which is attributable to the later launch date of the iPhone 15 series compared to the iPhone 14 series, which pushed some shipments into Q4 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

“While upgrade rates were slightly up at the carriers when compared to last quarter, they remained much below their usual levels as consumers opted to hold on to their devices for longer instead of upgrading,” said research analyst Matthew Orf.

Foldables are a potential bright spot in the US smartphone market, with increasing number of Android foldables options.

“Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 5 in August, while OnePlus launched its first foldable and Motorola launched the sub-$900 Motorola Raz 2022 in early Q4 2022,” said senior research analyst Maurice Klaehne.

Despite the carriers continuing to offer strong promotions through the quarter, upgrade rates at the carriers remained near record lows.

This daemon runs in the background to collect liquid detection analysis from each USB-C port on the Mac, the report mentioned.

This feature is described as a “Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon.”

iPhones and iPads have a similar daemon to alert users when liquid is detected in the connector.

On the Mac, the code suggests that the daemon is only used for “analytics” and is not associated with end-user features.

Apple may finally implement an alert similar to the iOS for Mac users too.

Apple’s limited warranty doesn’t cover damage caused by liquids, even for water-resistant products like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and some AirPods models.

macOS Sonoma 14.1 is the first major update to Apple’s new operating system. The update includes a number of new features and bug fixes.

Huawei and Xiaomi took fourth and fifth place, respectively, with the latter making its debut in the top five with the highest growth of the major vendors, according to the report by market research firm Canalys.

Chromebook shipments fell 19 per cent to 3.5 million in Q3 because much of the back-to-school inventory cleared through the channel.

Acer regained first place in Chromebook shipments with a relatively low drop of 16 per cent compared with Q2, but shipments still fell 17 per cent year-over-year.

Meanwhile, second-placed HP faced a larger sequential drop of 57% after previously taking the top spot. Dell maintained third place, with its Q3 shipments roughly matching HP’s. Lenovo and Asus took the final places in the top five rankings.

“With inventories stabilising, tablet shipments are starting to increase sequentially. This bodes well for the upcoming holiday season, where continued discounting and new product launches are set to drive the market back to year-on-year growth,” said Himani Mukka, Research Manager at Canalys.

Additionally, tablet vendors must start prioritising the integration of generative AI capabilities into their devices to maintain a competitive edge.

“Leading players Apple and Samsung have already signalled greater intent around incorporating AI experiences across their hardware portfolios,” Mukka added.

Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade.

The update includes a system that can detect liquids in USB-C ports on Mac laptops, a move that supplements existing Liquid Contact Indicators (LCI) present in these devices and specific Apple keyboards.

The new tool, named ""liquiddetectiond,"" operates silently in the background, collecting and analyzing data from each USB-C port. This ""Liquid Detection and Corrosion Mitigation Daemon"" primarily aids in data collection and analytics, rather than providing user notifications as similar systems do in iPhones and iPads.

The introduction of this feature is part of Apple's strategy to curtail unwarranted warranty claims and ensure a fair and accurate warranty process. Currently, Apple's warranty policy excludes coverage for damages resulting from accidental liquid exposure, even for water-resistant products such as iPhone, Apple Watch, and certain AirPod models.

The collected data from the ""liquiddetectiond"" daemon informs technicians' decisions about whether a Mac qualifies for free repair following accidental liquid exposure. It remains unclear whether this daemon is compatible with all Mac models or exclusively M3 Macs due to hardware requirements.

2022-11-04, Investing.com,"Apple's Q4 earnings surpass estimates, shares slide on lukewarm Q1 forecast",https://in.investing.com/news/apples-q4-earnings-surpass-estimates-shares-slide-on-lukewarm-q1-forecast-93CH-3885502,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) surpassed Wall Street's fourth-quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings per share (EPS) predictions, posting $1.46 versus the consensus estimate of $1.39. The tech giant also reported a slightly higher revenue of $89.5 billion, a 0.7% year-on-year decrease, beating the projected figure of $89.34 billion. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of slowing top-line growth.

Despite the better-than-expected results, Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) declined in premarket trading following the company's tepid current quarter guidance issued post-September results. This prompted Wall Street to revise its price target for Apple to $185 from a previous higher value, reflecting softer product demand but interest near $165 due to slower December quarter growth.

The company's forecast for stagnant holiday quarter revenue is attributed to a downturn in the Chinese market, triggered by government actions and increasing competition from Huawei's new phone offering. Consequently, Apple's revenue from China decreased to $15.1 billion, falling short of the predicted $17 billion.

In terms of product sales, Apple anticipates an increase in iPhone revenue for the current quarter, backed by comments from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and recent monthly revenue data from Taiwan Semiconductor. The expected growth in iPhone sales and the Mac refresh are likely to offset a sharp drop in iPad and wearables sales, notably in the smartwatch line.

Apple's Services sector, which is its second-largest business, is projected to grow ""strong double digits,"" following a 16% YoY rise in the September quarter. With over 1 billion paid subscribers, price hikes across Apple's Services business are expected to ensure steady revenue and EPS generation.

Despite CEO Tim Cook pointing out record revenues in India, China's slowdown poses a significant headwind for Apple's performance. However, any normalization of US-China relations could potentially enhance global economic sentiment and the shares of Apple and other tech companies like Micron (NASDAQ: ).

2022-11-03, Investing.com,"Apple unveils M3 chip family, invests heavily in cutting-edge technology",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-m3-chip-family-invests-heavily-in-cuttingedge-technology-93CH-3885234,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has introduced its M3 lineup, a series of chips manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSMC) N3 process technology. The M3 family, which includes the M3 with 25 billion transistors, the M3 Pro with 37 billion transistors, and the M3 Max with 92 billion transistors, caters to a range of computing needs from mainstream desktops to high-end tablets and laptops, performance-mainstream machines, and entry-level workstations. The M3 chips incorporate a unique GPU architecture that supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shaders, are built on an Arm instruction set architecture, integrate a new multimedia engine, and feature an AI NPU.

The M3 Max is noted for its complexity, rivaling AMD (NASDAQ: )'s Phoenix as the most complex single-die processor. Apple's adoption of TSMC's N3 fabrication process has led to increased economic efficiency, with around 415 M3 dies fitting on a single 300-mm wafer. This equates to a die size of approximately 146 mm^2, according to @Frederic_Orange.

This week, Jay Goldberg revealed on Digits to Dollars that the design and tape-out costs for the M3 series reached nearly $1 billion. This significant investment is reflected in Apple's $26.251 billion R&D budget allocation in 2022 for chip design. The tech giant also contributed $3.1 billion to TSMC's 3nm revenue and paid $20,000 per wafer without any special agreement or preferential treatment.

Despite the high costs associated with TSMC's 3nm process, Apple has chosen to use it for its latest MacBook Pro models featuring the A17 Pro chipset. This decision may be due to Apple's financial capabilities, as the high costs of the 3nm N3B process have led other companies, such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and MediaTek, to favor the less expensive N3E node.

Apple's investment in cutting-edge technology comes even though TSMC's 3nm yield is around 55 percent. The base M3 MacBook Pro with 8GB unified RAM and non-upgradeable storage is priced at $1,599, while the fully-unlocked M3 Max with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU carries a $500 premium.

InvestingPro Insights

Apple's aggressive investment in the development of the M3 lineup is reflected in the InvestingPro data and tips. The company has a hefty market cap of 2740.0B USD and a P/E Ratio of 28.59 as of Q3 2022. Despite a slight decline in revenue growth of -0.93% over the last twelve months, Apple's gross profit margin remains strong at 43.45%.

This financial strength is echoed in the InvestingPro Tips. Management's aggressive share buyback strategy is complemented by a high return on invested capital. The company has also maintained its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, a testament to its robust earnings.

InvestingPro offers many more tips and insights for Apple and other companies. This data can help investors make informed decisions about their portfolios.

Elsewhere, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is convicted of stealing billions of dollars from customers, capping a shocking fall from grace for the man who was once considered to be the face of the crypto industry.

1. Futures mixed ahead of fresh jobs report

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday as investors awaited the release of a closely-watched labor market report and digested earnings from Apple.

By 05:56 ET (09:56 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, dipped by 8 points or 0.2%, and lost 54 points or 0.4%.

The main indices on Wall Street are coming off of strong gains in the prior session that were fueled by the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged for a second straight meeting on Wednesday. Similar moves by policymakers at the Bank of England and in Norway also buoyed renewed hopes that an era of unprecedented monetary tightening may be coming to an end, providing a further lift to equities.

The 30-stock climbed 1.7%, while the benchmark and tech-heavy jumped by 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.

American government bonds, which have been hit in recent weeks by a prolonged sell-off, also rallied, with the seeing its biggest two-day fall since a banking sector crisis in March. Prices typically rise as yields decline.

2. Payrolls data looms

Attention now turns to the publication of the key for October due later in the day.

Economists predict that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs last month, down from 336,000 in September. The is seen at 3.8%, matching the prior month's figure, while are expected to have increased by 0.3% month-on-month in October, following a 0.2% gain in September.

Traders will likely be on the lookout for any signs of resilience in the labor market, a trend that could give the Fed more headroom to hike interest rates once again.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the possibility for additional policy increases, but stressed that officials will proceed carefully in response to a host of uncertainties facing the U.S. economy.

3. Apple fails to assuage outlook worries

Shares in Apple dipped in premarket U.S. trading, as concerns remained around the tech giant's projections for its current three-month period.

The California company flagged that revenue in its December quarter -- typically one of its largest due to holiday shopping -- would be in line with the corresponding time frame last year. However, the quarter will be one week shorter, denting sales by 7%.

In the September quarter, revenue at Apple's key Chinese market dropped by 2.5%, exacerbating worries over the impact of intensifying competition and geopolitical tensions. Rival Huawei released a new high-end smartphone during the period and China reportedly ordered government employees not to use Apple's flagship iPhone device.

But Apple executives maintained that the firm still gained market share in China, with Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri telling the Wall Street Journal that the four best-selling phones in the country were iPhones.

Overall sales in Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter dipped by a little under 1% to $89.5 billion. The figure marked the fourth consecutive quarterly decline, although it topped estimates of $89.31B. Earnings per share of $1.46 also beat expectations.

4. Sam Bankman-Fried convicted

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers by a jury in New York on Thursday.

The decision, which came after just five hours of juror deliberation, means that 31-year old Bankman-Fried -- once considered to be an icon in the crypto industry -- may be sentenced to decades in prison. He had faced seven charges, including wire fraud and money laundering.

His sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024.

Speaking after the verdict, victorious U.S. prosecutors said that Bankman-Fried's fraud aimed to position him as the ""king of crypto."" They added that despite the relative youth of the crypto industry, ""this kind of corruption is as old as time.""

Bankman-Fried's lawyer noted that while he respects the jury's decision, he will continue to ""vigorously"" fight the charges.

5. Crude on course for losing week

Oil prices on Friday were on course for their second consecutive losing week, despite posting sharp gains in the previous session after traders became increasingly confident that the Fed was done with its run of interest rate hikes.

By 05:56 ET, the futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.36 a barrel, while the contract slipped by 0.2% to $86.72 per barrel.

The benchmarks gained more than $2 a barrel on Thursday. However, both were set to shed more than 3% for the week, as a lack of escalation in the Israel-Hamas war eased worries about disruptions to supply in this oil-rich region. Meanwhile, recent data out of China has underscored an uncertain demand outlook in the world's top oil importer."
2022-11-03, Investing.com,Apple falls as soft holiday quarter outlook outweighs earnings beat; Brokerages lower numbers,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-q4-results-top-estimates-on-stronger-services-growth-3882936,"Investing.com - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) reported fiscal fourth quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates as better-than-expected services revenue boosted results.

While Apple was down modestly in after-hours trading on Thursday, losses accelerated after Apple's CFO Luca Maestri issued a soft sales outlook for the holiday quarter on the earnings call.

Apple stock was down 3.3% at 05:45 EDT (09:45 GMT).

The company earnings per share of $1.46 on revenue of $89.5 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.39 on revenue of $89.31B.

The beat on top and bottom lines comes as sales growth in Americas and Europe helped ease the hit to revenue from a 2.5% fall in China sales following a rise in competition from rivals including Huawei.

iPhone revenue rose 3% to $43.81B from a year earlier, in line with Wall Street estimates of $43.81B.

The services business including Apple Pay, Apple TV+ and iCloud storage saw revenue rise 16% to $22.31B to an all-time high from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates of $21.35B.

Gross margin, led by the services business, was up 6.1% in Q4 from a year earlier.

Apple’s wearables, home, and accessories category - previously called other products - fell 3.4% to $9.32B from the year-ago period, above estimates of $9.7 billion.

Revenue for the iPad fell 10% and revenue for the Mac plunged 34% in the quarter from a year earlier.

Speaking on the call, CFO Maestri said Apple expects FQ1 revenue to be similar to last year's. Apple generated $117.2 billion in December revenue last year, while Street was looking for $122.8 billion.

""We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week,"" the CFO said.

Several brokerages lowered their price targets on Apple stock in response to the softer-than-expected FQ1 guidance.

""The December quarter typically sets the tone for the year: Running out normal seasonality from Q1 points to company revenues of $370-380B, below consensus (~$407B),"" analysts at Bernstein said in a client note.

Analysts at Citi cut the price target by $10 to $230 per share, reflecting lowered product sales expectations.

2022-11-03, IANS,Apple leads global smartphone market revenues with 43% share: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-leads-global-smartphone-market-revenues-with-43-share-report-3883724,"New Delhi, Nov 3 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the global smartphone market revenues with 43 per cent share, its highest-ever in the third quarter (July-September period), a new report showed on Friday.The company achieved this feat despite Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series being available for one less week in the third quarter compared with its predecessor in the same period last year.

This translated into Apple also clocking its highest-ever share of global smartphone revenue for a September-ending quarter, according to the report by Counterpoint Research.

Global smartphone market revenues remained flat (year-on-year) despite growing by 15 per cent (quarter-on-quarter) to just over $100 billion in Q3.

“Pro Max being the best-selling variant of the iPhone 15 series contributed to Apple also achieving its highest-ever Q3 operating profit. However, its global smartphone operating profit share remained flat due to a resurgence of Huawei and HONOR, and an increased focus on profitability by other Chinese OEMs such as Xiaomi and OPPO,” said senior analyst Harmeet Singh Walia.

Consequently, the global smartphone operating profit reached an all-time high, signaling more definitely how the smartphone market has adjusted to the post-pandemic trend of lower shipments, he added.

Apple posted revenue of $89.5 billion in its September quarter.

Samsung’s average selling price (ASP) grew 4 per cent YoY thanks to the successful launch of Fold 5, maintained momentum in S23 series’ sales, and a higher flagship share in major product lineups.

Nevertheless, an 8 per cent shipment decline in the same period, offset the ASP increase, causing Samsung’s revenue to decline by 4 per cent annually, the report mentioned.

Xiaomi is the only top five smartphone brand to see shipment increases both QoQ and YoY in Q3 as it strengthened its positions in key markets such as China and India.

The full impact of the iPhone 15 series is yet to be seen during the global holiday season expected to be boosted by upgrades from iPhone 11 and 12 users.

The festive season in India would boost shipments and revenues in the world’s second-largest smartphone market where pent-up demand and 5G upgrades will also contribute to growth, the report mentioned.

Nevertheless, Cook also reported a quarterly record for iPhone sales in mainland China during the September quarter, with four out of the top five best-selling smartphones being iPhones.

The iPhone 15 series was made available on September 22 and received a good response globally, including in India.

“Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts,” said Cook.

The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2022 was another record year for switches.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design and are powered by industry-leading A17 Pro silicon chip, durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever.

According to industry experts, Apple enjoyed a strong growth momentum during the quarter, driven by aggressive double-digit growth in its old-generation iPhones.

""The premiumisation trend continued to steer Apple’s iPhone market growth,"" said Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group, CMR.

The Apple Services revenue also set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16 per cent year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter.

""Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO.

Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34 per cent year-over-year, “driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business”.

“Last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter,” said Maestri.

iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10 per cent year-over-year.

“Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter,” Maestri told the analysts.

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3 per cent year-over-year.

Technology-heavy indexes were the best performers for the day, tracking consensus-beating results from iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), while a further decline in Treasury yields also aided the sector.

A drop in Treasury yields also saw Wall Street indexes close higher overnight, which in turn provided a strong lead-in to Asian markets.

Asian tech rallies as yields dip, Apple suppliers surge

Hong Kong’s index was the best performer among its peers, rallying 2% on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

South Korea’s added 1%, while futures for India’s index pointed to a slightly stronger open on strength in local tech heavyweights.

Among individual stocks, Apple suppliers BYD (HK: ), AAC Technologies (HK: ) and Sunny Optical Tech (HK: ) surged between 2.5% to 7% in Hong Kong trade, after the iPhone maker logged better-than-expected earnings for the September quarter, even as sales in China fell from increased competition.

South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which supplies memory chips to Apple, rose 0.8%, while LG Display (KS: ) and LG Chem Ltd (KS: ) added 1.3% and 2.9%, respectively.

Tech stocks benefited heavily from a drop in this week, after the held interest rates as expected, but provided somewhat dovish signals on whether rates will rise further.

This provided much relief to tech stocks, which had otherwise been battered by a spike in yields in the lead-up to the Fed meeting, which concluded on Wednesday. But markets are still set for one more major test, with U.S. data for October due later in the day.

Any signs of resilience in the labor market gives the Fed more impetus to hike interest rates. The central bank has still left the door open for one more hike this year, and is set to keep rates higher for longer.

Among other Asian markets, Australia’s surged 1.1%, as data showed that unexpectedly grew in the third quarter. The strong retail sales reading sets up the for a potential interest rate hike when it meets this coming Tuesday.

Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

Chinese stocks rally past weak services PMI

China’s and indexes rose about 1% each, even as a private survey showed that Chinese service sector activity grew less than expected in October.

But the reading still improved slightly from September, amid some strength in foreign demand.

While Chinese stocks saw some gains this week, a bulk of these gains were driven by bargain buying, given that other economic readings for October showed a surprise decline in ."

The fell by up to 16 basis points to 4.62%, a substantial decline from last week's highs of over 5%. This was triggered by the Treasury Department's quarterly auction plan, which indicated a deceleration in long-duration bond issuance. The decrease in yields provided relief to Wall Street bond investors following a protracted selloff.

The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Jerome Powell, maintained interest rates at the 5.25%-5.5% range for the second consecutive meeting due to tight financial conditions. Despite positive strides in inflation management acknowledged by Powell, no further rate cuts were suggested.

Market predictions from the CME FedWatch Tool indicate no further interest rate hikes are anticipated. This comes as several investors have misjudged the termination of a selloff that threatens Treasuries with a third year of losses.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller has demonstrated bullishness on U.S. Treasury bonds due to apprehensions about the U.S. economy's health. Advocates for bonds argue for amplified exposure to long-term securities, which could rise in value if an economic slowdown prompts the Fed to lower rates.

Indicators of a subtle economic slowdown include diminishing savings from the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of student loan repayments, and soaring borrowing costs affecting consumers and businesses alike.

2022-11-02, Investing.com,Apple's December quarter outlook in focus ahead of latest earnings report,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-december-quarter-outlook-in-focus-ahead-of-latest-earnings-report-3882386,"Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ: ) is due to unveil its latest three-month earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, with investors eager for details on the tech giant's performance during its September quarter as well as a look into its expectations for the crucial holiday shopping season.

This year has so far been mostly positive for the iPhone maker's stock. Shares have risen by over 30% in 2022, with traders comforted by the popularity of Apple's products and solid cash flow.

Yet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in at $89.34 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus forecasts -- a fall from $90.1B in the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.

Meanwhile, analysts at JPMorgan Chase have flagged that headwinds are looming as Apple progresses through the December quarter, particularly in the form of a strong dollar, iPhone supply problems, and rising competition from rival Huawei in its key Chinese market. Lackluster global consumer spending momentum is also driving an elongation in the replacement cycle of smart devices, they argued.

""Sentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days,"" the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said in a note. They added that they will be on the lookout for commentary around the estimated quarter-on-quarter evolution of Apple's sales of gadgets like the iPhone, iPad tablets, and Mac laptops. Projected growth in the double digits is also expected at the company's services business, which includes offerings like Apple TV+ and AppleCare device insurance.

Analysts at Barclays (LON: ) have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest by revenue thanks largely to the holiday season -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates, citing in part signs of softening demand for new iPhones. Fresh versions of Apple's flagship smartphone, which feature a redesigned titanium body and USB-C charging port, were launched in September.

Apple's executives may also face questions around their plans to keep pace with other tech industry rivals in the intensifying race to harness and monetize the nascent growth of generative artificial intelligence, observers said. Heavy capital expenditures could be needed to grow A.I.'s presence in the business, although this would likely cause free cash flow to decline in Apple's 2024 fiscal year, according to analysts at KeyBanc.

""We believe [Apple] has a solid foundation of A.I. within its products and services though [it] has very little room for incremental capital investment in 2024 while also growing [free cash flow],"" the KeyBanc analysts wrote in a note."

2022-11-03, Investing.com,"Apple unveils M3 chip family, invests heavily in cutting-edge technology",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-m3-chip-family-invests-heavily-in-cuttingedge-technology-93CH-3885234,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has introduced its M3 lineup, a series of chips manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s (TSMC) N3 process technology. The M3 family, which includes the M3 with 25 billion transistors, the M3 Pro with 37 billion transistors, and the M3 Max with 92 billion transistors, caters to a range of computing needs from mainstream desktops to high-end tablets and laptops, performance-mainstream machines, and entry-level workstations. The M3 chips incorporate a unique GPU architecture that supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shaders, are built on an Arm instruction set architecture, integrate a new multimedia engine, and feature an AI NPU.

The M3 Max is noted for its complexity, rivaling AMD (NASDAQ: )'s Phoenix as the most complex single-die processor. Apple's adoption of TSMC's N3 fabrication process has led to increased economic efficiency, with around 415 M3 dies fitting on a single 300-mm wafer. This equates to a die size of approximately 146 mm^2, according to @Frederic_Orange.

This week, Jay Goldberg revealed on Digits to Dollars that the design and tape-out costs for the M3 series reached nearly $1 billion. This significant investment is reflected in Apple's $26.251 billion R&D budget allocation in 2022 for chip design. The tech giant also contributed $3.1 billion to TSMC's 3nm revenue and paid $20,000 per wafer without any special agreement or preferential treatment.

Despite the high costs associated with TSMC's 3nm process, Apple has chosen to use it for its latest MacBook Pro models featuring the A17 Pro chipset. This decision may be due to Apple's financial capabilities, as the high costs of the 3nm N3B process have led other companies, such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and MediaTek, to favor the less expensive N3E node.

Apple's investment in cutting-edge technology comes even though TSMC's 3nm yield is around 55 percent. The base M3 MacBook Pro with 8GB unified RAM and non-upgradeable storage is priced at $1,599, while the fully-unlocked M3 Max with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU carries a $500 premium.

InvestingPro Insights

Apple's aggressive investment in the development of the M3 lineup is reflected in the InvestingPro data and tips. The company has a hefty market cap of 2740.0B USD and a P/E Ratio of 28.59 as of Q3 2022. Despite a slight decline in revenue growth of -0.93% over the last twelve months, Apple's gross profit margin remains strong at 43.45%.

This financial strength is echoed in the InvestingPro Tips. Management's aggressive share buyback strategy is complemented by a high return on invested capital. The company has also maintained its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, a testament to its robust earnings.

Elsewhere, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is convicted of stealing billions of dollars from customers, capping a shocking fall from grace for the man who was once considered to be the face of the crypto industry.

1. Futures mixed ahead of fresh jobs report

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Friday as investors awaited the release of a closely-watched labor market report and digested earnings from Apple.

By 05:56 ET (09:56 GMT), the contract was mostly unchanged, dipped by 8 points or 0.2%, and lost 54 points or 0.4%.

The main indices on Wall Street are coming off of strong gains in the prior session that were fueled by the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged for a second straight meeting on Wednesday. Similar moves by policymakers at the Bank of England and in Norway also buoyed renewed hopes that an era of unprecedented monetary tightening may be coming to an end, providing a further lift to equities.

The 30-stock climbed 1.7%, while the benchmark and tech-heavy jumped by 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.

American government bonds, which have been hit in recent weeks by a prolonged sell-off, also rallied, with the seeing its biggest two-day fall since a banking sector crisis in March. Prices typically rise as yields decline.

2. Payrolls data looms

Attention now turns to the publication of the key for October due later in the day.

Economists predict that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs last month, down from 336,000 in September. The is seen at 3.8%, matching the prior month's figure, while are expected to have increased by 0.3% month-on-month in October, following a 0.2% gain in September.

Traders will likely be on the lookout for any signs of resilience in the labor market, a trend that could give the Fed more headroom to hike interest rates once again.

Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell left open the possibility for additional policy increases, but stressed that officials will proceed carefully in response to a host of uncertainties facing the U.S. economy.

3. Apple fails to assuage outlook worries

Shares in Apple dipped in premarket U.S. trading, as concerns remained around the tech giant's projections for its current three-month period.

The California company flagged that revenue in its December quarter -- typically one of its largest due to holiday shopping -- would be in line with the corresponding time frame last year. However, the quarter will be one week shorter, denting sales by 7%.

In the September quarter, revenue at Apple's key Chinese market dropped by 2.5%, exacerbating worries over the impact of intensifying competition and geopolitical tensions. Rival Huawei released a new high-end smartphone during the period and China reportedly ordered government employees not to use Apple's flagship iPhone device.

But Apple executives maintained that the firm still gained market share in China, with Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri telling the Wall Street Journal that the four best-selling phones in the country were iPhones.

Overall sales in Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter dipped by a little under 1% to $89.5 billion. The figure marked the fourth consecutive quarterly decline, although it topped estimates of $89.31B. Earnings per share of $1.46 also beat expectations.

4. Sam Bankman-Fried convicted

Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was found guilty of stealing billions of dollars from customers by a jury in New York on Thursday.

The decision, which came after just five hours of juror deliberation, means that 31-year old Bankman-Fried -- once considered to be an icon in the crypto industry -- may be sentenced to decades in prison. He had faced seven charges, including wire fraud and money laundering.

His sentencing date was set for March 28, 2024.

Speaking after the verdict, victorious U.S. prosecutors said that Bankman-Fried's fraud aimed to position him as the ""king of crypto."" They added that despite the relative youth of the crypto industry, ""this kind of corruption is as old as time.""

Bankman-Fried's lawyer noted that while he respects the jury's decision, he will continue to ""vigorously"" fight the charges.

5. Crude on course for losing week

Oil prices on Friday were on course for their second consecutive losing week, despite posting sharp gains in the previous session after traders became increasingly confident that the Fed was done with its run of interest rate hikes.

By 05:56 ET, the futures traded 0.1% lower at $82.36 a barrel, while the contract slipped by 0.2% to $86.72 per barrel.

The benchmarks gained more than $2 a barrel on Thursday. However, both were set to shed more than 3% for the week, as a lack of escalation in the Israel-Hamas war eased worries about disruptions to supply in this oil-rich region. Meanwhile, recent data out of China has underscored an uncertain demand outlook in the world's top oil importer."
2022-11-03, Investing.com,Apple falls as soft holiday quarter outlook outweighs earnings beat; Brokerages lower numbers,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-q4-results-top-estimates-on-stronger-services-growth-3882936,"Investing.com - Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) reported fiscal fourth quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates as better-than-expected services revenue boosted results.

While Apple was down modestly in after-hours trading on Thursday, losses accelerated after Apple's CFO Luca Maestri issued a soft sales outlook for the holiday quarter on the earnings call.

Apple stock was down 3.3% at 05:45 EDT (09:45 GMT).

The company earnings per share of $1.46 on revenue of $89.5 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecast EPS of $1.39 on revenue of $89.31B.

The beat on top and bottom lines comes as sales growth in Americas and Europe helped ease the hit to revenue from a 2.5% fall in China sales following a rise in competition from rivals including Huawei.

iPhone revenue rose 3% to $43.81B from a year earlier, in line with Wall Street estimates of $43.81B.

The services business including Apple Pay, Apple TV+ and iCloud storage saw revenue rise 16% to $22.31B to an all-time high from a year earlier, beating analyst estimates of $21.35B.

Gross margin, led by the services business, was up 6.1% in Q4 from a year earlier.

Apple’s wearables, home, and accessories category - previously called other products - fell 3.4% to $9.32B from the year-ago period, above estimates of $9.7 billion.

Revenue for the iPad fell 10% and revenue for the Mac plunged 34% in the quarter from a year earlier.

Speaking on the call, CFO Maestri said Apple expects FQ1 revenue to be similar to last year's. Apple generated $117.2 billion in December revenue last year, while Street was looking for $122.8 billion.

""We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week,"" the CFO said.

Several brokerages lowered their price targets on Apple stock in response to the softer-than-expected FQ1 guidance.

""The December quarter typically sets the tone for the year: Running out normal seasonality from Q1 points to company revenues of $370-380B, below consensus (~$407B),"" analysts at Bernstein said in a client note.

Analysts at Citi cut the price target by $10 to $230 per share, reflecting lowered product sales expectations.

2022-11-03, IANS,Apple leads global smartphone market revenues with 43% share: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-leads-global-smartphone-market-revenues-with-43-share-report-3883724,"New Delhi, Nov 3 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) led the global smartphone market revenues with 43 per cent share, its highest-ever in the third quarter (July-September period), a new report showed on Friday.The company achieved this feat despite Apple’s latest iPhone 15 series being available for one less week in the third quarter compared with its predecessor in the same period last year.

This translated into Apple also clocking its highest-ever share of global smartphone revenue for a September-ending quarter, according to the report by Counterpoint Research.

Global smartphone market revenues remained flat (year-on-year) despite growing by 15 per cent (quarter-on-quarter) to just over $100 billion in Q3.

“Pro Max being the best-selling variant of the iPhone 15 series contributed to Apple also achieving its highest-ever Q3 operating profit. However, its global smartphone operating profit share remained flat due to a resurgence of Huawei and HONOR, and an increased focus on profitability by other Chinese OEMs such as Xiaomi and OPPO,” said senior analyst Harmeet Singh Walia.

Consequently, the global smartphone operating profit reached an all-time high, signaling more definitely how the smartphone market has adjusted to the post-pandemic trend of lower shipments, he added.

Apple posted revenue of $89.5 billion in its September quarter.

Samsung’s average selling price (ASP) grew 4 per cent YoY thanks to the successful launch of Fold 5, maintained momentum in S23 series’ sales, and a higher flagship share in major product lineups.

Nevertheless, an 8 per cent shipment decline in the same period, offset the ASP increase, causing Samsung’s revenue to decline by 4 per cent annually, the report mentioned.

Xiaomi is the only top five smartphone brand to see shipment increases both QoQ and YoY in Q3 as it strengthened its positions in key markets such as China and India.

The full impact of the iPhone 15 series is yet to be seen during the global holiday season expected to be boosted by upgrades from iPhone 11 and 12 users.

The festive season in India would boost shipments and revenues in the world’s second-largest smartphone market where pent-up demand and 5G upgrades will also contribute to growth, the report mentioned.

The dipped to a two-week low as futures on major US stock indexes rose following Powell's comments. Justin Burgin of Ameriprise Financial (NYSE: ) pointed to Powell's comments and better-than-expected earnings as reasons for market optimism.

The iPhone 15 series was made available on September 22 and received a good response globally, including in India.

“Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts,” said Cook.

The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2022 was another record year for switches.

The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design and are powered by industry-leading A17 Pro silicon chip, durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever.

According to industry experts, Apple enjoyed a strong growth momentum during the quarter, driven by aggressive double-digit growth in its old-generation iPhones.

""The premiumisation trend continued to steer Apple’s iPhone market growth,"" said Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group, CMR.

The Apple Services revenue also set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16 per cent year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter.

""Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category,” said Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO.

Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34 per cent year-over-year, “driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business”.

“Last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter,” said Maestri.

iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10 per cent year-over-year.

“Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter,” Maestri told the analysts.

Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3 per cent year-over-year.

Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, said the company.

2022-11-03, Investing.com,"Asian stocks rally tracking Wall St strength, easing Fed fears",https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-rally-tracking-wall-st-strength-easing-fed-fears-3883235,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose sharply on Friday, encouraged by strength on Wall Street and increased bets that the Federal Reserve was done with its run of interest rate hikes, although focus still remained on key U.S. payrolls data due later in the day.

Technology-heavy indexes were the best performers for the day, tracking consensus-beating results from iPhone maker Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), while a further decline in Treasury yields also aided the sector.

A drop in Treasury yields also saw Wall Street indexes close higher overnight, which in turn provided a strong lead-in to Asian markets.

Asian tech rallies as yields dip, Apple suppliers surge

Hong Kong’s index was the best performer among its peers, rallying 2% on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

South Korea’s added 1%, while futures for India’s index pointed to a slightly stronger open on strength in local tech heavyweights.

Among individual stocks, Apple suppliers BYD (HK: ), AAC Technologies (HK: ) and Sunny Optical Tech (HK: ) surged between 2.5% to 7% in Hong Kong trade, after the iPhone maker logged better-than-expected earnings for the September quarter, even as sales in China fell from increased competition. But this increased competition is expected to benefit Chinese suppliers of smartphone components.

South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which supplies memory chips to Apple, rose 0.8%, while LG Display (KS: ) and LG Chem Ltd (KS: ) added 1.3% and 2.9%, respectively.

Tech stocks benefited heavily from a drop in this week, after the held interest rates as expected, but provided somewhat dovish signals on whether rates will rise further.

This provided much relief to tech stocks, which had otherwise been battered by a spike in yields in the lead-up to the Fed meeting, which concluded on Wednesday. But markets are still set for one more major test, with U.S. data for October due later in the day.

Any signs of resilience in the labor market gives the Fed more impetus to hike interest rates. The central bank has still left the door open for one more hike this year, and is set to keep rates higher for longer.

Among other Asian markets, Australia’s surged 1.1%, as data showed that unexpectedly grew in the third quarter. The strong retail sales reading sets up the for a potential interest rate hike when it meets this coming Tuesday.

Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

Chinese stocks rally past weak services PMI

China’s and indexes rose about 1% each, even as a private survey showed that Chinese service sector activity grew less than expected in October.

But the reading still improved slightly from September, amid some strength in foreign demand.

While Chinese stocks saw some gains this week, a bulk of these gains were driven by bargain buying, given that other economic readings for October showed a surprise decline in ."

During the company’s quarterly earnings call late on Thursday, where Apple said it posted quarterly revenue of $89.5 billion, the iPhone maker grew in very strong double digits in India in the July-September quarter (which also new iPhone 15 series sales which started on September 22).

“We achieved an all-time revenue record in India as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more,” said Cook.

“In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations,” he added.

In response to an analyst question on momentum in India, Cook said that India is “an incredibly exciting market for them and a major focus"" for the company.

“We have a low share in a large market and so it would seem that there’s a lot of headroom there. We see an extraordinary market -- a lot of people moving into the middle class,” the Apple CEO noted.

“Lots of positives, we put two retail stores there and they are doing better than we anticipated -- it’s still early going but they are off to a good start and I couldn’t be happier with how things are going at the moment,” he added.

Apple's revenue in India hit nearly Rs 50,000 crore in FY23, with sales increasing 48 per cent to Rs 49,321 crore and net profit rising 76 per cent to Rs 2,229 crore.

The company recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India, crossing 2.5 million units, in the third quarter (July-September period) this year.

The rose by 0.92% to reach 33,582.15 points, and the increased by 1.32% to hit 13,234.22 points.

The fell by up to 16 basis points to 4.62%, a substantial decline from last week's highs of over 5%. This was triggered by the Treasury Department's quarterly auction plan, which indicated a deceleration in long-duration bond issuance. The decrease in yields provided relief to Wall Street bond investors following a protracted selloff.

The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Jerome Powell, maintained interest rates at the 5.25%-5.5% range for the second consecutive meeting due to tight financial conditions. Despite positive strides in inflation management acknowledged by Powell, no further rate cuts were suggested.

Market predictions from the CME FedWatch Tool indicate no further interest rate hikes are anticipated. This comes as several investors have misjudged the termination of a selloff that threatens Treasuries with a third year of losses.

Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller has demonstrated bullishness on U.S. Treasury bonds due to apprehensions about the U.S. economy's health. Advocates for bonds argue for amplified exposure to long-term securities, which could rise in value if an economic slowdown prompts the Fed to lower rates.

Indicators of a subtle economic slowdown include diminishing savings from the COVID-19 pandemic, the resumption of student loan repayments, and soaring borrowing costs affecting consumers and businesses alike.

2022-11-02, Investing.com,Apple's December quarter outlook in focus ahead of latest earnings report,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-december-quarter-outlook-in-focus-ahead-of-latest-earnings-report-3882386,"Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ: ) is due to unveil its latest three-month earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, with investors eager for details on the tech giant's performance during its September quarter as well as a look into its expectations for the crucial holiday shopping season.

This year has so far been mostly positive for the iPhone maker's stock. Shares have risen by over 30% in 2022, with traders comforted by the popularity of Apple's products and solid cash flow.

Yet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in at $89.34 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus forecasts -- a fall from $90.1B in the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.

Meanwhile, analysts at JPMorgan Chase have flagged that headwinds are looming as Apple progresses through the December quarter, particularly in the form of a strong dollar, iPhone supply problems, and rising competition from rival Huawei in its key Chinese market. Lackluster global consumer spending momentum is also driving an elongation in the replacement cycle of smart devices, they argued.

""Sentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days,"" the JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said in a note. They added that they will be on the lookout for commentary around the estimated quarter-on-quarter evolution of Apple's sales of gadgets like the iPhone, iPad tablets, and Mac laptops. Projected growth in the double digits is also expected at the company's services business, which includes offerings like Apple TV+ and AppleCare device insurance.

Analysts at Barclays (LON: ) have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest by revenue thanks largely to the holiday season -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates, citing in part signs of softening demand for new iPhones. Fresh versions of Apple's flagship smartphone, which feature a redesigned titanium body and USB-C charging port, were launched in September.

Apple's executives may also face questions around their plans to keep pace with other tech industry rivals in the intensifying race to harness and monetize the nascent growth of generative artificial intelligence, observers said. Heavy capital expenditures could be needed to grow A.I.'s presence in the business, although this would likely cause free cash flow to decline in Apple's 2024 fiscal year, according to analysts at KeyBanc.

""We believe [Apple] has a solid foundation of A.I. within its products and services though [it] has very little room for incremental capital investment in 2024 while also growing [free cash flow],"" the KeyBanc analysts wrote in a note."
2022-11-02, Investing.com,"Futures higher after Fed decision, Apple earnings ahead - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-higher-after-fed-decision-apple-earnings-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3881153,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures point into the green, as markets examined statements from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the central bank's decision to keep interest rates steady for a second straight meeting. Apple (NASDAQ: ) gears up to unveil its latest three-month earnings, with analysts also eager for any guidance from the tech giant on trading during its crucial December quarter. Shell (LON: ) bumps up its share buybacks, boosting shares in the oil group.

1. Futures inch higher after Fed verdict

U.S. stock futures were trading higher on Thursday, with investors digesting the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.

By 05:55 ET (09:55 GMT), the contract had gained 102 points or 0.3%, had added 22 points or 0.5%, and had risen by 107 points or 0.7%.

The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted to keep the all-important federal funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, although Chair Jerome Powell flagged that the process of bringing inflation back down to policymakers' 2% objective ""has a long way to go.""

After the announcement, the benchmark climbed by 1.1%, while the 30-stock and tech-heavy moved up by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively. European and Asian equities both followed Wall Street into the green, in a possible sign that global investors are becoming more confident that the Fed has finished tightening policy this year.

Elsewhere, the fell against a basket of its peers, while the price of -- the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capital -- hit its highest mark since May 2022.

2. Powell vows to proceed ""carefully""

The Fed's choice to keep borrowing costs at a more than two-decade high may have been widely cheered by markets weary after months of unprecedented rate hikes, but Powell noted in a closely-watched post-meeting news conference that officials are still asking themselves if more increases are warranted.

For now, he stressed that the Fed will only ""proceed carefully,"" arguing that monetary policy is currently at a ""restrictive"" level.

Some eyebrows were raised by the statement, particularly in the wake of unexpectedly strong data which hinted at a surprising resilience in the U.S. economy. This trend has in turn sparked worries that a recent cooling in inflation could lose steam.

However, Powell remained confident that inflation would continue to decelerate, albeit in ""lumps."" In any event, the comments pointed to the delicate task before the Fed: corralling price pressures without causing deep economic malaise.

3. Apple earnings ahead

Attention now turns to Apple as the tech giant prepares to unveil earnings for its September quarter after the closing bell on Thursday.

For the iPhone maker's stock, 2022 has so far been a positive year. Shares have risen by just over 30% over that time, with traders comforted by the company's popular product offerings and solid cash flow.

Yet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in $89.28 billion, which would be a fall of around 1% compared to the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.

For the December quarter, a possible downturn in demand in the firm's key Chinese market and lackluster consumer spending sentiment have been cited by analysts as looming headwinds. Indeed, analysts at Barclays (LON: ) have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest thanks to holiday season shopping -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates.

4. Shell increases share buybacks

London-listed shares in Shell jumped in early trading after the oil major announced share buybacks of $3.5 billion over the next three months, up from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter.

Meanwhile, the company left its dividend at $0.331 per share despite a quarterly performance that Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan described in a statement as ""strong.""

Shell's adjusted third-quarter earnings of $6.2B met company-provided market estimates, although the figure was 34% lower on an annual basis. Solid trading at its liquefied natural gas unit helped offset a drop in energy prices and a decline in production at its Integrated Gas division.

""We continue to simplify our portfolio while delivering more value with less emissions,"" Wael said.

5. Crude ends three-day decline following Fed decision

Oil prices rebounded Thursday, snapping a three-day fall, after the Fed kept interest rates on hold, hitting the dollar and helping risk appetite return to financial markets.

By 05:55 ET, the futures traded 1.6% higher at $81.72 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.4% to $85.83 per barrel. Both benchmarks settled at their multi-weeks lows in the previous session, having dropped around 10% in October.

Sentiment buoyed by Powell’s comments

European equities have followed the positive lead from Wall Street, with the tech-heavy closing 1.6% higher, after investors became increasingly confident the next move in U.S. interest rates will be down, not up in the wake of the latest policy-setting meeting from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The kept rates steady on Wednesday, as widely expected, and while Chair maintained the option of another hike, his comments suggested he was less than committed to the idea.

Risks were now ""more two sided"" and almost ""balanced"", he said in his press conference, and expectations of inflation ""were in a good place"".

Shell (LON: ) lifts its share buybacks, maintains dividend

Back in Europe, the earnings season continued, with Shell stock rising 1.2% after the oil major announced share buybacks of $3.5 billion over the next three months, up from $2.7 billion in the previous three months, and maintained its dividend even while reporting a sharp annual drop in third-quarter profit to $6.2 billion as energy prices cooled.

Lufthansa (ETR: ) stock rose 6.5% after the German carrier reported quarterly profits slightly above expectations on the back of robust travel demand this summer, stating that bookings remained strong ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season.

On the flip side, Zalando (ETR: ) stock fell 1.3% after Europe's biggest online fashion retailer reported weaker than expected third-quarter revenue, and saw continued pressure on demand for the rest of the year, expecting 2022 sales to decline.

ING (AS: ) stock fell 4.6% after the Dutch bank warned of slowing global economic growth even as it announced its second share buyback program of the year, following third-quarter net profits that more than doubled from the previous year.

That said, the corporate highlight of the day is likely to come from the U.S., as Apple (NASDAQ: ), the world’s biggest company by market capitalization, is due to release its latest earnings after the market closes.

Bank of England seen holding steady

Back in Europe, it’s the turn of the to announce its latest monetary policy decision later in the session.

This central bank is widely expected to follow the European Central Bank and the Fed in keeping interest rates unchanged at their 15-year high this month, but it still has to battle an that came in at 6.7% in September, more than three times its target.

The European data slate includes data for October, as well as numbers for many European countries and the eurozone as a whole.

In a Medium blogpost, he further predicted that the importance of the South Asian market to Apple (NASDAQ: ) will notably rise in the coming year.

Taiwanese giant Foxconn currently owns between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of India's iPhone production capacity, said Kuo.

This dynamic is expected to shift as Tata Group begins manufacturing iPhones at the Wistron production line it acquired in India.

""By making India’s Tata an iPhone assembler (already acquired Wistron’s iPhone production lines in India), Apple can strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. This move will benefit future sales of iPhones and other products in India and is critical to Apple’s growth over the next decade,"" he said.

Kuo also anticipated that Apple would begin introductory manufacturing for the regular iPhone 17, which is scheduled to appear in the second half of 2025, in India in the second half of next year.

According to him, this will be Apple's first foray into developing a new iPhone model outside of China.

The standard iPhone is chosen for its lower-difficulty design development to reduce design risk, the analyst said.

Moreover, Kuo estimated that Foxconn's production capacity in Zhengzhou and Taiyuan, China, will fall by 35 per cent to 45 per cent and 75 per cent to 85 per cent, respectively, by 2024.

“In addition to expanding production in India, Luxshare’s rapid increase in iPhone order allocation and improvements in production line automation are also the main reasons for the production scale reduction,” he wrote.

Vivo also saw an uptick in its performance, with an 11% YoY growth. The company's market share increased from 14.4% to 15.9%, largely due to the success of its sub-brand iQOO.

Overall, the recovery of the Indian smartphone industry in Q3 2022 signals a positive trend for the sector after several quarters of decline.

2022-11-02, Investing.com,Asian markets surge following Federal Reserve's hint at policy shift,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-markets-surge-following-federal-reserves-hint-at-policy-shift-93CH-3880649,"Asian stock markets, including those in Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea, experienced a significant surge today, reflecting the upward trajectory of U.S equities and bonds. This surge follows the Federal Reserve's hint at ending its policy tightening cycle, a move that has been met with optimism from investors. Wall Street's and the tech-heavy also saw impressive gains, marking the S&P's best weekly performance since March, while mainland Chinese stocks remained stable.

The Federal Reserve's unchanged interest rate stance influenced U.S prices to rise over 1% amid the Israel-Gaza conflict, driven by supply concerns and potential effects on global economy and oil demand. Concurrently, falling Treasury yields weakened the U.S dollar but strengthened the Japanese yen.

The Fed's stance on interest rates was announced by Jerome Powell, who highlighted a considerable tightening of financial conditions due to higher long-term bond yields. This reduced the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like and positively impacted major alternative cryptocurrencies such as , , and .

On Thursday, Asian equity futures had gained after a rally in US stocks and bonds as the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates. This fueled hopes for an end to rate hikes, causing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 to rally by 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Japanese, Australian, and Hong Kong shares also rose during this period.

On Wednesday, Australian and New Zealand yields fell in line with Treasury yields after plans were announced to slow long-term debt sales increases. Despite hinting at potential future hikes, Powell noted tightening financial conditions due to higher bond yields.

Mixed US jobs data showed more job openings but fewer new roles than expected. The Bank of England is likely to hold rates as inflation concerns ease. Asian economic releases include South Korea's inflation data, Malaysia's monetary policy decision, and Singapore's PMI data. Corporate earnings are expected from Tata Motors (NS: ) (NYSE: ) Ltd, Adani Enterprises (NS: ) Ltd, Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE: ), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). Among these, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s positive forecast contrasted Airbnb Inc.'s disappointing Q4 outlook. West Texas Intermediate's price rose slightly below $81 per barrel.

2022-11-02, IANS,"Apple can’t block iPhone ‘throttling’ class-action lawsuit, rules court",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-cant-block-iphone-throttling-classaction-lawsuit-rules-court-3880399,"London, Nov 2 (IANS) The Competition Appeal Tribunal here has denied Apple’s request to block a UK class action lawsuit that accused the tech giant of intentionally slowing down the performance of older iPhones to encourage customers to buy newer models.Consumer rights campaigner Justin Gutmann filed a lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) last year that alleged the company installed batteries in the iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, SE, 7, and 7 Plus that couldn’t keep up with the device’s processor or operating system, reports The Verge.

Apple attempted to block the lawsuit in May, calling the accusations “baseless”.

The company also denied claims that its batteries had issues, except for some iPhone 6S models.

“We have never -- and would never -- do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that,” the spokesperson added.

Gutmann filed the lawsuit in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London, on behalf of up to 25 million UK iPhone users who used any of 10 different models of iPhone.

According to the lawsuit, the iPhone maker ""misled"" iPhone users by releasing a power management software update that ""secretly throttled"" the performance of affected devices.

In 2020, Apple announced to pay up to $500 million in the US market to end several lawsuits accusing the company of slowing down certain older iPhone models with software updates.

Apple in 2017 had admitted that it occasionally slowed down certain iPhone models with older batteries to avoid unexpected shutdowns.

Apple denied any wrongdoing, but agreed for the settlement.

However, it apologised for not communicating to users properly and offered affected customers cut-price iPhone battery replacements.

The Fed continued its cautious monetary policy approach, though stopped short of ruling out further rate hikes. Still, it was enough to set November's markets off to a positive start after a downbeat October.

Investors will now look to Friday's job report for October for signs the Fed won't have to make further rate increases. Analysts expect jobs to come in lower than they did the previous month, though Wednesday's job openings report was stronger than expected and the ADP (NASDAQ: ) private payroll report showed companies added more workers than they did in the prior month.

Earnings from Apple are also on tap Thursday after the market closes, and analysts will be closely listening to what the company says about consumer demand for its latest $1000 iPhone model.

Consumer demand has kept the economy humming despite rising prices and expectations that eventually households will rein in their spending, though officials and many economists are no longer forecasting a recession in the next 12 months.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Apple earnings

Tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.39 on revenue of $89.3 billion.

2. Eli Lilly reports

Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: ) is expected to report a per-share loss of 19 cents on revenue of $8.97 billion. Rival Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $9.13 on revenue of $56.8 billion.

2022-11-01, Investing.com,Apple 'negative groupthink' way overdone argues Wedbush,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-negative-groupthink-way-overdone-argues-wedbush-432SI-3879532,"The ""negative groupthink"" sentiment on Apple (NASDAQ: ) is ""way overdone,"" according to analysts at Wedbush in a note Wednesday.

They told investors that their firm sees the iPhone maker reporting a good iPhone/services outlook when it posts earnings after the close on Thursday.

""Right now, the overall sentiment of Apple on the Street is a negative 'groupthink mentality' heading into the print that we view as very disconnected from the current iPhone 15 growth we see in the field based on our recent checks and trip to Asia, that gives us a high level of confidence in owning Apple at these levels,"" said the analysts, who maintained an Outperform rating on the stock.

""We believe a slight upside in the September quarter led by a stronger Services growth now back to double digits with iPhone unit demand activity in the US/Europe key this quarter,"" they added. Total revenue of $89 billion and EPS of $1.39 we view as beatable numbers this quarter. Mac and iPad remain weak and have tough comparables but that dynamic is known by the New York City cab driver at this point and does not move the needle on the stock in our opinion. It's all about iPhone 15 demand and Services growth back in the double digits for FY24.""

The analysts added that the elephant in the room this quarter is ""clearly China demand around iPhone 15 units,"" which Wedbush believes appears to have slowed the last month after coming out of the gates strong with pre-order activity.

""We believe Cook will have a generally positive tone on the call around China iPhone demand for the December quarter despite massively negative Street sentiment building around the Cupertino story,"" contend the analysts. ""In a nutshell, we believe over 100 million iPhones in China alone are in the window of an upgrade opportunity and that remains the golden goose on this cycle for Apple with a very heavy mix of iPhone Pro this time.""

Wedbush said that with Service revenue back to double-digit growth and iPhone units that should be in the ~225 million range for FY24, the ""growth demise story"" of Apple being spun by bears is a dynamic that has constantly played out over the past decade, ""and this is just another chapter in that book."""

The companies' strong brand identities, consistent dividends, regular share repurchases, and steady cash generation are among the key factors contributing to this investment preference.

Apple is bracing for a fiscal slowdown in 2022 with projected decreases of 9% in revenue and 6% in EPS. This is attributed to iPhone market saturation, declining Mac shipments post-pandemic, and currency issues. The ongoing U.S.-China tech and trade war adds another layer of complexity to Apple's operations in China.

However, despite these challenges, Apple's services ecosystem showcases robust growth with over a billion paid subscribers and new products like Vision Pro. The tech giant also holds $166 billion in cash reserves. Over the past five years, it has repurchased nearly one-fifth of its shares, indicating potential for increased dividend payouts as the company matures.

On the other hand, Coca-Cola has made a strong recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn with a 16% growth in organic sales in both 2021 and 2022. This growth can be attributed to product diversification beyond carbonated drinks and the revival of its flagship sodas.

Despite inflationary pressures, Coca-Cola reported a 7% increase in adjusted EPS in 2022 and has been consistent in raising its dividend annually for 61 consecutive years. However, over the past five years, the company's share count grew about 1% due to stock-based compensation slightly offsetting buybacks. Coca-Cola also maintains more than $14 billion in cash reserves.

While both companies carry high valuations due to investor interest, they are considered reliable long-term investments. The decision on which of these cash-generating, dividend-paying behemoths represents a superior investment, however, remains a topic of ongoing discussion.

“Q3 2022 also marked the best quarter for Apple’s shipments in the country, which crossed 2.5 million units,” said research analyst Shubham Singh.

Premiumisation has started in the world’s second largest smartphone market and Apple has again got the timing right to benefit from this trend through its devices and financing offers, Singh added.

India’s smartphone shipments remained flat in the third quarter.

After declining for almost a year, the smartphone market is showing signs of recovery with a gradual pick-up in consumer demand going into the all-important festive season.

“We saw some interesting launches, with key features like 5G and higher RAM (8GB) diffusing to affordable smartphones (sub-Rs 10,000). Many OEMs are now coming up with interesting financing schemes through partnerships with financial institutions and by marketing the per-day cost of buying a new device,” said senior research analyst Shilpi Jain.

Samsung (KS: ) maintained its leading position for the fourth consecutive quarter with a 17.2 per cent share driven by the success of its A and M series.

“Samsung was closely followed by Xiaomi, with its 16.6% market share driven by strong demand for the Redmi 12 series and offline expansion. Xiaomi is effectively capitalizing on the opportunity to provide 5G technology in the budget segment. Its latest Redmi 12 5G series received an overwhelming response from consumers,” said Singh.

vivo retained the third spot but was the fastest growing brand among the top five, experiencing 11 per cent YoY growth.

Strong offline presence, focused approach to CMF (Colour, Material, Finish), and targeting the mid-premium segment through its sub-brand IQOO drove the demand for vivo, the report mentioned.

OnePlus was the top brand in the affordable premium segment (Rs 30,000-Rs 45,000) with a 29 per cent share driven by strong sales of the OnePlus 11R.

In Q3, the share of 5G smartphone shipments reached 53 per cent, said the report.

(NASDAQ: ) is set to implement significant changes to its AirPods product line over the next two years, according to Bloomberg analysts. The tech giant's plans include the introduction of new versions of the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, as well as a minimally updated AirPods Max 2.

Despite the last update to the Max version occurring in 2020, Apple remains committed to this model, planning new color options and a USB Type-C port. The release timeline for the noise-cancellation-equipped AirPods 4, which will be available in two variants, remains uncertain, but it is slated for a late 2024 release.

The redesigned AirPods Pro is set for a 2025 launch and will offer improved active noise cancellation, adaptive transparency mode, extended battery life facilitated by the advanced H2 chipset adopted in September 2022, and health monitoring features. Interestingly, the Max version is expected to continue using the older H1 chip.

This shift towards USB Type-C aligns with Apple's transition that began with the iPhone 15 series. This comes as part of a broader overhaul of its existing series. The last significant upgrades were introduced in 2021 on the AirPods 3, but Apple aims to replace both entry-level versions of AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 in the near future.

In addition to these updates, Apple recently updated its flagship AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C port and introduced the Adaptive Audio suite with iOS 17. The company is also planning to launch the Vision Pro mixed reality headset and a new lossless audio protocol for the AirPods Pro 2. Currently, the most affordable models in their lineup are the AirPods 3 ($169) and the AirPods 2 ($129).

The new series includes base, Pro, and Max models, marking Apple's first full CPU family launch. Built on a three-nanometer process, the M3 chip offers significant performance enhancements due to improved CPU and GPU architectures. This development comes three years after Apple's strategic transition from Intel (NASDAQ: ) to its own silicon for PCs.

The M3 chip series places Apple in a competitive position against Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and AMD (NASDAQ: ), who are speculated to be developing ARM chips for PCs. Apple is already accepting pre-orders for M3-based MacBook Pros and iMacs, including the M3 Pro variant.

In contrast to Apple's M3 chip, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip is built on a 4nm process node and incorporates 12 high-performance cores alongside an Adreno GPU. The GPU delivers up to 4.6 teraflops of graphics processing power. During a benchmarking session, Qualcomm demonstrated the X Elite's capabilities using a setup with 80W and a fan, reaching 4.3GHz for single-threaded tasks and 3.8GHz for multi-threaded tasks.

With the X Elite, Qualcomm aims to fill a gap in the Windows ecosystem which currently lacks an ARM-powered PC chip that can rival Apple’s M-series processors. This move is seen as a potential disruption to Intel's dominance in the PC market.

The introduction of the M3 and X Elite chips represent a paradigm shift towards PCs leveraging mobile-friendly ARM architecture. Both Apple and Qualcomm aim to transition the PC market from Intel's dominance to a computer-chip landscape based on this ARM architecture.

The highlights included the introduction of the new M3 chip family (M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max), the new MacBook Pro models, and the iMac, all powered by these newly introduced chips. The event garnered significant attention from Wall Street firms, and here's a snapshot of their analyses:

Citi:

Apple's M3 chips promise impressive features, including a next-generation GPU with ""Dynamic Caching"" technology and powerful CPU performance cores. Compared to the M1 chips introduced in 2021, the new M3-equipped MacBook Pro models boast speeds up to 11x faster than their Intel (NASDAQ: ) counterparts.

Analysts at Citi believe the M3 chip will continue to drive Intel-based model users to switch to the in-house models for better performance and longer battery life. Citi maintained its Buy rating, with a $240 price target.

Morgan Stanley:

While the Mac has gained 300bps of TTM global PC market share since the first M-series chip was introduced in June 2020, the bank highlighted that performance concerns about the M2 resulted in a slowing of Mac share gains in recent quarters. The ""Scary Fast"" M3 MacBook Pro is Apple's response, offering better performance and more accessibility. With a 20% cheaper 'entry-level' SKU for the 14"" MacBook Pro with M3 compared to the lowest-end M2 ProPowered MacBook Pro, Apple is now offering its fastest M-series SoC family on its best-selling Mac SKU to a wider audience than ever before. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the M3 MacBook launch could help turn around the Mac business, especially with the holiday season approaching. The firm maintained an Overweight rating with a $210 price target on the stock.

Deutsche Bank:

Analysts at Deutsche Bank emphasized the potential of the new MacBook Pro products in capturing significant market share during the upcoming holiday season. As for iMac, the bank believes it’s due for an upgrade given the last product was based on M1 processor introduced in April 2021. Overall, Deutsche Bank believes the impressive performance of Apple silicon should continue to help the company gain a share in a PC market that is expected to see only modest growth in the next few years. The bank maintained a Buy rating with a $200 price target on the stock.

Evercore ISI:

Analysts at Evercore ISI foresee the new chips driving an incremental refresh, emphasizing the substantial boosts in performance and capabilities they offer. The firm reiterated its Outperform rating with a $210 price target.

Bernstein:

While the new processors and Macs were in line with expectations, the analysts believe Apple watchers might feel some disappointment, having hoped for a larger M3 iMac or other speculated products, such as upgraded iPad mini, new Airpods, or upgraded Mac accessories with USB-C connectors.

Analysts at Bernstein think the new Mac's revenue impact on Apple is anticipated to be minimal, given the Mac business accounts for about 8% of Apple's total revenues. Moreover, the analysts noted that the Mac introductions yesterday were performance improvements, rather than redesigns, which historically have had a more significant impact on Macs' performance.

The disputes concern the unauthorized use of Nokia's video-related technologies in streaming devices and services offered by these companies. This move comes after years of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at reaching patent licensing agreements.

Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, has stated that litigation was the only option left, as both Amazon and HP have significantly profited from Nokia's research in mobile telephony without adhering to the rules followed by other companies. This legal action is taking place against the backdrop of the European Commission's efforts to minimize such conflicts and stimulate innovation in the tech industry.

While these legal battles are underway, Nokia has silently entered into a licensing agreement with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). The details of this agreement, however, have not been disclosed to the public.

InvestingPro Insights

As the legal battles unfold, it's worth considering the financial health and market position of the companies involved. According to InvestingPro, Amazon, a prominent player in the broadband retail industry, has seen a large price uptick over the last six months. The company's net income is expected to grow this year, with 20 analysts revising their earnings upwards for the upcoming period. However, it's important to note that Amazon operates with a moderate level of debt, which has increased over consecutive years.

InvestingPro's real-time data highlights Amazon's market cap of $1370.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 67.95, indicating a high earnings multiple. Over the last twelve months as of Q3 2022, Amazon reported revenue growth of 10.32% and a gross profit margin of 46.24%.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon X, intensifying competition in PC processor market",https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x-intensifying-competition-in-pc-processor-market-93CH-3877378,"In a bid to penetrate the personal computer industry, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Inc. has introduced its potent laptop processor, Snapdragon X. The chip, which boasts 12 high-performance cores running at 3.8 gigahertz, is said to be twice as fast as Intel (NASDAQ: )'s comparable 12-core processor and consumes 68% less power. This development heightens competition in the computer processors market, where Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc. are also developing their own CPUs using Arm technology.

Following the announcement, Qualcomm's stock initially rose by 1.5% but later declined amid a broader tech downturn. Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, views these developments as a validation of Qualcomm’s decision to enter the PC market and is confident that the market will embrace Arm technology.

The Snapdragon X is claimed to run 50% faster at peak times than Apple’s M2, which Apple (NASDAQ: ) promotes as the leading computer processor. To secure a significant position in the PC market, currently dominated by Intel’s technology, Qualcomm must substantiate these claims.

Amon suggests that PCs are evolving into communication devices and anticipates that AI capabilities will bring further transformation. The Snapdragon X was developed after Qualcomm acquired Nuvia Inc., a startup founded by ex-Apple executive Gerard Williams. This acquisition reduced Qualcomm's reliance on Arm's technology.

The new processor includes features tailored for AI workloads. Qualcomm proposes that AI can fully realize its potential if it migrates from data centers to end-user devices like phones and PCs.

Nvidia leads in data center chips enhancing AI computing and its move into PC processors intensifies competition. Nvidia's PC offering, along with AMD's new Arm chip, is expected to launch as early as 2025.

Intel, a dominant player since the 1980s, is feeling the pressure and is investing significantly in new technology under CEO Pat Gelsinger to regain its position. Concurrently, Qualcomm announced a new version of its Snapdragon 8 lineup for smartphones. This system on a chip, designed with AI workloads in mind, includes a processor, modem, and other components.

The analysts, who maintained a Neutral rating and $190 price target on the stock, told investors in a note that they are trimming their fourth-quarter estimates for the company while they see consensus FY24 expectations likely moving lower given the China risk.

""Ahead of Apple earnings, we trim Sept qtr iPhone and Mac revenue forecasts 1.0% and 4.7% respectively to reflect soft demand across the two largest regions, the US and China,"" the analysts wrote.

""While demand trends have been soft throughout the quarter, checks indicate demand did not materially pick-up in Sept.

""In addition, we est Macs declined ~24% YoY in the quarter, the 4th consecutive YoY decline as excess inventory from Sept-22 was worked off.""

UBS's new September revenue estimate of $88.1 billion (prior $89 billion) is below the consensus of $89.5 billion.

This comes as a surprise to many who anticipated a shift to USB-C, a trend already seen across other Apple products. The iPhone 15 lineup, second-gen AirPods, new Apple Pencil, and Siri Remote for Apple TV have already made the switch to USB-C.

The decision not to upgrade Magic accessories to USB-C has led to some inconvenience for new iMac users who also own an iPhone 15. These users are now required to keep a separate cable exclusively for charging their Magic accessories. Furthermore, the design issue of an awkwardly located charging port at the bottom of the Magic Mouse remains unaddressed.

The 24-inch iMac base configuration detailed in the ""What's in the Box"" section includes these accessories and a color-matched Lightning to USB-C cable. Higher storage configurations also offer a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Currently, only AirPods, AirPods Max, iPhone SE, and iMac peripherals retain the Lightning port.

However, an impending regulation by the EU mandates keyboards and mice to transition to USB-C by the end of 2024. This may lead Apple to revisit and revise their accessory designs in the near future. Speculation is also rife about a possible USB-C upgrade for AirPods and AirPods Max next year, which could indicate a similar switch for Mac accessories.

2022-11-02, Investing.com,"Futures higher after Fed decision, Apple earnings ahead - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-higher-after-fed-decision-apple-earnings-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3881153,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures point into the green, as markets examined statements from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell following the central bank's decision to keep interest rates steady for a second straight meeting. Apple (NASDAQ: ) gears up to unveil its latest three-month earnings, with analysts also eager for any guidance from the tech giant on trading during its crucial December quarter. Shell (LON: ) bumps up its share buybacks, boosting shares in the oil group.

1. Futures inch higher after Fed verdict

U.S. stock futures were trading higher on Thursday, with investors digesting the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.

By 05:55 ET (09:55 GMT), the contract had gained 102 points or 0.3%, had added 22 points or 0.5%, and had risen by 107 points or 0.7%.

The U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday voted to keep the all-important federal funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, although Chair Jerome Powell flagged that the process of bringing inflation back down to policymakers' 2% objective ""has a long way to go.""

After the announcement, the benchmark climbed by 1.1%, while the 30-stock and tech-heavy moved up by 0.7% and 1.6%, respectively. European and Asian equities both followed Wall Street into the green, in a possible sign that global investors are becoming more confident that the Fed has finished tightening policy this year.

Elsewhere, the fell against a basket of its peers, while the price of -- the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capital -- hit its highest mark since May 2022.

2. Powell vows to proceed ""carefully""

The Fed's choice to keep borrowing costs at a more than two-decade high may have been widely cheered by markets weary after months of unprecedented rate hikes, but Powell noted in a closely-watched post-meeting news conference that officials are still asking themselves if more increases are warranted.

For now, he stressed that the Fed will only ""proceed carefully,"" arguing that monetary policy is currently at a ""restrictive"" level.

Some eyebrows were raised by the statement, particularly in the wake of unexpectedly strong data which hinted at a surprising resilience in the U.S. economy. This trend has in turn sparked worries that a recent cooling in inflation could lose steam.

However, Powell remained confident that inflation would continue to decelerate, albeit in ""lumps."" In any event, the comments pointed to the delicate task before the Fed: corralling price pressures without causing deep economic malaise.

3. Apple earnings ahead

Attention now turns to Apple as the tech giant prepares to unveil earnings for its September quarter after the closing bell on Thursday.

For the iPhone maker's stock, 2022 has so far been a positive year. Shares have risen by just over 30% over that time, with traders comforted by the company's popular product offerings and solid cash flow.

Yet its fiscal fourth quarter sales are expected to come in $89.28 billion, which would be a fall of around 1% compared to the same period last year and the fourth straight quarterly drop.

For the December quarter, a possible downturn in demand in the firm's key Chinese market and lackluster consumer spending sentiment have been cited by analysts as looming headwinds. Indeed, analysts at Barclays (LON: ) have warned that Apple's guidance for its current quarter -- typically its biggest thanks to holiday season shopping -- may potentially miss Wall Street estimates.

4. Shell increases share buybacks

London-listed shares in Shell jumped in early trading after the oil major announced share buybacks of $3.5 billion over the next three months, up from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter.

Meanwhile, the company left its dividend at $0.331 per share despite a quarterly performance that Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan described in a statement as ""strong.""

Shell's adjusted third-quarter earnings of $6.2B met company-provided market estimates, although the figure was 34% lower on an annual basis. Solid trading at its liquefied natural gas unit helped offset a drop in energy prices and a decline in production at its Integrated Gas division.

""We continue to simplify our portfolio while delivering more value with less emissions,"" Wael said.

5. Crude ends three-day decline following Fed decision

Oil prices rebounded Thursday, snapping a three-day fall, after the Fed kept interest rates on hold, hitting the dollar and helping risk appetite return to financial markets.

By 05:55 ET, the futures traded 1.6% higher at $81.72 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.4% to $85.83 per barrel. Both benchmarks settled at their multi-weeks lows in the previous session, having dropped around 10% in October.

Markets largely traded past U.S. inventory data, with official data from the showing a slightly smaller-than-expected build in oil inventories over the week to October 27.

Distillate inventories declined by less than anticipated, while gasoline inventories saw an unexpected but limited build."

Sentiment buoyed by Powell’s comments

European equities have followed the positive lead from Wall Street, with the tech-heavy closing 1.6% higher, after investors became increasingly confident the next move in U.S. interest rates will be down, not up in the wake of the latest policy-setting meeting from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The kept rates steady on Wednesday, as widely expected, and while Chair maintained the option of another hike, his comments suggested he was less than committed to the idea.

Risks were now ""more two sided"" and almost ""balanced"", he said in his press conference, and expectations of inflation ""were in a good place"".

Shell (LON: ) lifts its share buybacks, maintains dividend

Back in Europe, the earnings season continued, with Shell stock rising 1.2% after the oil major announced share buybacks of $3.5 billion over the next three months, up from $2.7 billion in the previous three months, and maintained its dividend even while reporting a sharp annual drop in third-quarter profit to $6.2 billion as energy prices cooled.

Lufthansa (ETR: ) stock rose 6.5% after the German carrier reported quarterly profits slightly above expectations on the back of robust travel demand this summer, stating that bookings remained strong ahead of the busy Christmas holiday season.

On the flip side, Zalando (ETR: ) stock fell 1.3% after Europe's biggest online fashion retailer reported weaker than expected third-quarter revenue, and saw continued pressure on demand for the rest of the year, expecting 2022 sales to decline.

ING (AS: ) stock fell 4.6% after the Dutch bank warned of slowing global economic growth even as it announced its second share buyback program of the year, following third-quarter net profits that more than doubled from the previous year.

That said, the corporate highlight of the day is likely to come from the U.S., as Apple (NASDAQ: ), the world’s biggest company by market capitalization, is due to release its latest earnings after the market closes.

Bank of England seen holding steady

Back in Europe, it’s the turn of the to announce its latest monetary policy decision later in the session.

This central bank is widely expected to follow the European Central Bank and the Fed in keeping interest rates unchanged at their 15-year high this month, but it still has to battle an that came in at 6.7% in September, more than three times its target.

In a Medium blogpost, he further predicted that the importance of the South Asian market to Apple (NASDAQ: ) will notably rise in the coming year.

Taiwanese giant Foxconn currently owns between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of India's iPhone production capacity, said Kuo.

This dynamic is expected to shift as Tata Group begins manufacturing iPhones at the Wistron production line it acquired in India.

""By making India’s Tata an iPhone assembler (already acquired Wistron’s iPhone production lines in India), Apple can strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. This move will benefit future sales of iPhones and other products in India and is critical to Apple’s growth over the next decade,"" he said.

Kuo also anticipated that Apple would begin introductory manufacturing for the regular iPhone 17, which is scheduled to appear in the second half of 2025, in India in the second half of next year.

According to him, this will be Apple's first foray into developing a new iPhone model outside of China.

The standard iPhone is chosen for its lower-difficulty design development to reduce design risk, the analyst said.

Moreover, Kuo estimated that Foxconn's production capacity in Zhengzhou and Taiyuan, China, will fall by 35 per cent to 45 per cent and 75 per cent to 85 per cent, respectively, by 2024.

“In addition to expanding production in India, Luxshare’s rapid increase in iPhone order allocation and improvements in production line automation are also the main reasons for the production scale reduction,” he wrote.

Wall Street's and the tech-heavy also saw impressive gains, marking the S&P's best weekly performance since March, while mainland Chinese stocks remained stable.

The Federal Reserve's unchanged interest rate stance influenced U.S prices to rise over 1% amid the Israel-Gaza conflict, driven by supply concerns and potential effects on global economy and oil demand. Concurrently, falling Treasury yields weakened the U.S dollar but strengthened the Japanese yen.

Apple attempted to block the lawsuit in May, calling the accusations “baseless”.

The company also denied claims that its batteries had issues, except for some iPhone 6S models.

“We have never -- and would never -- do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,” an Apple spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“Our goal has always been to create products that our customers love, and making iPhones last as long as possible is an important part of that,” the spokesperson added.

Gutmann filed the lawsuit in the Competition Appeal Tribunal in London, on behalf of up to 25 million UK iPhone users who used any of 10 different models of iPhone.

According to the lawsuit, the iPhone maker ""misled"" iPhone users by releasing a power management software update that ""secretly throttled"" the performance of affected devices.

In 2020, Apple announced to pay up to $500 million in the US market to end several lawsuits accusing the company of slowing down certain older iPhone models with software updates.

Apple in 2017 had admitted that it occasionally slowed down certain iPhone models with older batteries to avoid unexpected shutdowns.

Apple denied any wrongdoing, but agreed for the settlement.

However, it apologised for not communicating to users properly and offered affected customers cut-price iPhone battery replacements.

The Fed continued its cautious monetary policy approach, though stopped short of ruling out further rate hikes. Still, it was enough to set November's markets off to a positive start after a downbeat October.

Investors will now look to Friday's job report for October for signs the Fed won't have to make further rate increases. Analysts expect jobs to come in lower than they did the previous month, though Wednesday's job openings report was stronger than expected and the ADP (NASDAQ: ) private payroll report showed companies added more workers than they did in the prior month.

Earnings from Apple are also on tap Thursday after the market closes, and analysts will be closely listening to what the company says about consumer demand for its latest $1000 iPhone model.

They told investors that their firm sees the iPhone maker reporting a good iPhone/services outlook when it posts earnings after the close on Thursday.

""Right now, the overall sentiment of Apple on the Street is a negative 'groupthink mentality' heading into the print that we view as very disconnected from the current iPhone 15 growth we see in the field based on our recent checks and trip to Asia, that gives us a high level of confidence in owning Apple at these levels,"" said the analysts, who maintained an Outperform rating on the stock.

""We believe a slight upside in the September quarter led by a stronger Services growth now back to double digits with iPhone unit demand activity in the US/Europe key this quarter,"" they added. Total revenue of $89 billion and EPS of $1.39 we view as beatable numbers this quarter. Mac and iPad remain weak and have tough comparables but that dynamic is known by the New York City cab driver at this point and does not move the needle on the stock in our opinion. It's all about iPhone 15 demand and Services growth back in the double digits for FY24.""

The analysts added that the elephant in the room this quarter is ""clearly China demand around iPhone 15 units,"" which Wedbush believes appears to have slowed the last month after coming out of the gates strong with pre-order activity.

""We believe Cook will have a generally positive tone on the call around China iPhone demand for the December quarter despite massively negative Street sentiment building around the Cupertino story,"" contend the analysts. ""In a nutshell, we believe over 100 million iPhones in China alone are in the window of an upgrade opportunity and that remains the golden goose on this cycle for Apple with a very heavy mix of iPhone Pro this time.""

Wedbush said that with Service revenue back to double-digit growth and iPhone units that should be in the ~225 million range for FY24, the ""growth demise story"" of Apple being spun by bears is a dynamic that has constantly played out over the past decade, ""and this is just another chapter in that book."""

2022-11-01, Investing.com,Apple and Coca-Cola dominate Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-cocacola-dominate-berkshire-hathaways-portfolio-93CH-3879086,"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: )'s portfolio shows a significant allocation towards Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), accounting for 47% and 7% respectively, as of Wednesday. The companies' strong brand identities, consistent dividends, regular share repurchases, and steady cash generation are among the key factors contributing to this investment preference.

Apple is bracing for a fiscal slowdown in 2022 with projected decreases of 9% in revenue and 6% in EPS. This is attributed to iPhone market saturation, declining Mac shipments post-pandemic, and currency issues. The ongoing U.S.-China tech and trade war adds another layer of complexity to Apple's operations in China.

However, despite these challenges, Apple's services ecosystem showcases robust growth with over a billion paid subscribers and new products like Vision Pro. The tech giant also holds $166 billion in cash reserves. Over the past five years, it has repurchased nearly one-fifth of its shares, indicating potential for increased dividend payouts as the company matures.

On the other hand, Coca-Cola has made a strong recovery from the pandemic-induced downturn with a 16% growth in organic sales in both 2021 and 2022. This growth can be attributed to product diversification beyond carbonated drinks and the revival of its flagship sodas.

Despite inflationary pressures, Coca-Cola reported a 7% increase in adjusted EPS in 2022 and has been consistent in raising its dividend annually for 61 consecutive years. However, over the past five years, the company's share count grew about 1% due to stock-based compensation slightly offsetting buybacks. Coca-Cola also maintains more than $14 billion in cash reserves.

While both companies carry high valuations due to investor interest, they are considered reliable long-term investments. The decision on which of these cash-generating, dividend-paying behemoths represents a superior investment, however, remains a topic of ongoing discussion.

2022-11-01, IANS,Apple logs highest-ever smartphone shipments in India in Q3,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-logs-highestever-smartphone-shipments-in-india-in-q3-3878891,"New Delhi, Nov 1 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) recorded its highest ever quarterly shipments in India, crossing 2.5 million units, in the third quarter (July-September period) this year, a new report showed on Wednesday.Experiencing a high-growth phase in India, Apple recorded 34 per cent growth (year-on-year).

“Q3 2022 also marked the best quarter for Apple’s shipments in the country, which crossed 2.5 million units,” said research analyst Shubham Singh.

Premiumisation has started in the world’s second largest smartphone market and Apple has again got the timing right to benefit from this trend through its devices and financing offers, Singh added.

India’s smartphone shipments remained flat in the third quarter.

After declining for almost a year, the smartphone market is showing signs of recovery with a gradual pick-up in consumer demand going into the all-important festive season.

“We saw some interesting launches, with key features like 5G and higher RAM (8GB) diffusing to affordable smartphones (sub-Rs 10,000). Many OEMs are now coming up with interesting financing schemes through partnerships with financial institutions and by marketing the per-day cost of buying a new device,” said senior research analyst Shilpi Jain.

Samsung (KS: ) maintained its leading position for the fourth consecutive quarter with a 17.2 per cent share driven by the success of its A and M series.

“Samsung was closely followed by Xiaomi, with its 16.6% market share driven by strong demand for the Redmi 12 series and offline expansion. Xiaomi is effectively capitalizing on the opportunity to provide 5G technology in the budget segment. Its latest Redmi 12 5G series received an overwhelming response from consumers,” said Singh.

vivo retained the third spot but was the fastest growing brand among the top five, experiencing 11 per cent YoY growth.

Strong offline presence, focused approach to CMF (Colour, Material, Finish), and targeting the mid-premium segment through its sub-brand IQOO drove the demand for vivo, the report mentioned.

OnePlus was the top brand in the affordable premium segment (Rs 30,000-Rs 45,000) with a 29 per cent share driven by strong sales of the OnePlus 11R.

In Q3, the share of 5G smartphone shipments reached 53 per cent, said the report.

2022-11-01, Investing.com,Apple plans major revamp for AirPods lineup by 2025,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-plans-major-revamp-for-airpods-lineup-by-2025-93CH-3878279,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is set to implement significant changes to its AirPods product line over the next two years, according to Bloomberg analysts. The tech giant's plans include the introduction of new versions of the AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 3, as well as a minimally updated AirPods Max 2.

Despite the last update to the Max version occurring in 2020, Apple remains committed to this model, planning new color options and a USB Type-C port. The release timeline for the noise-cancellation-equipped AirPods 4, which will be available in two variants, remains uncertain, but it is slated for a late 2024 release.

The redesigned AirPods Pro is set for a 2025 launch and will offer improved active noise cancellation, adaptive transparency mode, extended battery life facilitated by the advanced H2 chipset adopted in September 2022, and health monitoring features. Interestingly, the Max version is expected to continue using the older H1 chip.

This shift towards USB Type-C aligns with Apple's transition that began with the iPhone 15 series. This comes as part of a broader overhaul of its existing series. The last significant upgrades were introduced in 2021 on the AirPods 3, but Apple aims to replace both entry-level versions of AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 in the near future.

In addition to these updates, Apple recently updated its flagship AirPods Pro 2 with a USB-C port and introduced the Adaptive Audio suite with iOS 17. The company is also planning to launch the Vision Pro mixed reality headset and a new lossless audio protocol for the AirPods Pro 2. Currently, the most affordable models in their lineup are the AirPods 3 ($169) and the AirPods 2 ($129).

The new series includes base, Pro, and Max models, marking Apple's first full CPU family launch. Built on a three-nanometer process, the M3 chip offers significant performance enhancements due to improved CPU and GPU architectures. This development comes three years after Apple's strategic transition from Intel (NASDAQ: ) to its own silicon for PCs.

The M3 chip series places Apple in a competitive position against Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and AMD (NASDAQ: ), who are speculated to be developing ARM chips for PCs. Apple is already accepting pre-orders for M3-based MacBook Pros and iMacs, including the M3 Pro variant.

In contrast to Apple's M3 chip, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip is built on a 4nm process node and incorporates 12 high-performance cores alongside an Adreno GPU. The GPU delivers up to 4.6 teraflops of graphics processing power. During a benchmarking session, Qualcomm demonstrated the X Elite's capabilities using a setup with 80W and a fan, reaching 4.3GHz for single-threaded tasks and 3.8GHz for multi-threaded tasks.

With the X Elite, Qualcomm aims to fill a gap in the Windows ecosystem which currently lacks an ARM-powered PC chip that can rival Apple’s M-series processors. This move is seen as a potential disruption to Intel's dominance in the PC market.

The introduction of the M3 and X Elite chips represent a paradigm shift towards PCs leveraging mobile-friendly ARM architecture. Both Apple and Qualcomm aim to transition the PC market from Intel's dominance to a computer-chip landscape based on this ARM architecture.

The highlights included the introduction of the new M3 chip family (M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max), the new MacBook Pro models, and the iMac, all powered by these newly introduced chips. The event garnered significant attention from Wall Street firms, and here's a snapshot of their analyses:

Citi:

Apple's M3 chips promise impressive features, including a next-generation GPU with ""Dynamic Caching"" technology and powerful CPU performance cores. Compared to the M1 chips introduced in 2021, the new M3-equipped MacBook Pro models boast speeds up to 11x faster than their Intel (NASDAQ: ) counterparts. Likewise, the new iMac is up to 4x faster than the 21.5-inch Intel models. Analysts at Citi believe the M3 chip will continue to drive Intel-based model users to switch to the in-house models for better performance and longer battery life. Citi maintained its Buy rating, with a $240 price target.

Morgan Stanley:

While the Mac has gained 300bps of TTM global PC market share since the first M-series chip was introduced in June 2020, the bank highlighted that performance concerns about the M2 resulted in a slowing of Mac share gains in recent quarters. The ""Scary Fast"" M3 MacBook Pro is Apple's response, offering better performance and more accessibility. With a 20% cheaper 'entry-level' SKU for the 14"" MacBook Pro with M3 compared to the lowest-end M2 ProPowered MacBook Pro, Apple is now offering its fastest M-series SoC family on its best-selling Mac SKU to a wider audience than ever before. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict that the M3 MacBook launch could help turn around the Mac business, especially with the holiday season approaching. The firm maintained an Overweight rating with a $210 price target on the stock.

Deutsche Bank:

Analysts at Deutsche Bank emphasized the potential of the new MacBook Pro products in capturing significant market share during the upcoming holiday season. As for iMac, the bank believes it’s due for an upgrade given the last product was based on M1 processor introduced in April 2021. Overall, Deutsche Bank believes the impressive performance of Apple silicon should continue to help the company gain a share in a PC market that is expected to see only modest growth in the next few years. The bank maintained a Buy rating with a $200 price target on the stock.

Evercore ISI:

Analysts at Evercore ISI foresee the new chips driving an incremental refresh, emphasizing the substantial boosts in performance and capabilities they offer. The firm reiterated its Outperform rating with a $210 price target.

Bernstein:

While the new processors and Macs were in line with expectations, the analysts believe Apple watchers might feel some disappointment, having hoped for a larger M3 iMac or other speculated products, such as upgraded iPad mini, new Airpods, or upgraded Mac accessories with USB-C connectors.

Analysts at Bernstein think the new Mac's revenue impact on Apple is anticipated to be minimal, given the Mac business accounts for about 8% of Apple's total revenues. Moreover, the analysts noted that the Mac introductions yesterday were performance improvements, rather than redesigns, which historically have had a more significant impact on Macs' performance. Bernstein reiterated its Market Perform rating with a $195 price target on the stock."

The disputes concern the unauthorized use of Nokia's video-related technologies in streaming devices and services offered by these companies. This move comes after years of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at reaching patent licensing agreements.

Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, has stated that litigation was the only option left, as both Amazon and HP have significantly profited from Nokia's research in mobile telephony without adhering to the rules followed by other companies. This legal action is taking place against the backdrop of the European Commission's efforts to minimize such conflicts and stimulate innovation in the tech industry.

While these legal battles are underway, Nokia has silently entered into a licensing agreement with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). The details of this agreement, however, have not been disclosed to the public.

The chip, which boasts 12 high-performance cores running at 3.8 gigahertz, is said to be twice as fast as Intel (NASDAQ: )'s comparable 12-core processor and consumes 68% less power. This development heightens competition in the computer processors market, where Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) Inc. are also developing their own CPUs using Arm technology.

Following the announcement, Qualcomm's stock initially rose by 1.5% but later declined amid a broader tech downturn. Qualcomm's CEO, Cristiano Amon, views these developments as a validation of Qualcomm’s decision to enter the PC market and is confident that the market will embrace Arm technology.

The Snapdragon X is claimed to run 50% faster at peak times than Apple’s M2, which Apple (NASDAQ: ) promotes as the leading computer processor. To secure a significant position in the PC market, currently dominated by Intel’s technology, Qualcomm must substantiate these claims.

Amon suggests that PCs are evolving into communication devices and anticipates that AI capabilities will bring further transformation. The Snapdragon X was developed after Qualcomm acquired Nuvia Inc., a startup founded by ex-Apple executive Gerard Williams. This acquisition reduced Qualcomm's reliance on Arm's technology.

The new processor includes features tailored for AI workloads. Qualcomm proposes that AI can fully realize its potential if it migrates from data centers to end-user devices like phones and PCs.

Nvidia leads in data center chips enhancing AI computing and its move into PC processors intensifies competition. Nvidia's PC offering, along with AMD's new Arm chip, is expected to launch as early as 2025.

Intel, a dominant player since the 1980s, is feeling the pressure and is investing significantly in new technology under CEO Pat Gelsinger to regain its position. Concurrently, Qualcomm announced a new version of its Snapdragon 8 lineup for smartphones. This system on a chip, designed with AI workloads in mind, includes a processor, modem, and other components.

This comes as a surprise to many who anticipated a shift to USB-C, a trend already seen across other Apple products. The iPhone 15 lineup, second-gen AirPods, new Apple Pencil, and Siri Remote for Apple TV have already made the switch to USB-C.

The decision not to upgrade Magic accessories to USB-C has led to some inconvenience for new iMac users who also own an iPhone 15. These users are now required to keep a separate cable exclusively for charging their Magic accessories. Furthermore, the design issue of an awkwardly located charging port at the bottom of the Magic Mouse remains unaddressed.

The 24-inch iMac base configuration detailed in the ""What's in the Box"" section includes these accessories and a color-matched Lightning to USB-C cable. Higher storage configurations also offer a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Currently, only AirPods, AirPods Max, iPhone SE, and iMac peripherals retain the Lightning port.

However, an impending regulation by the EU mandates keyboards and mice to transition to USB-C by the end of 2024. This may lead Apple to revisit and revise their accessory designs in the near future. Speculation is also rife about a possible USB-C upgrade for AirPods and AirPods Max next year, which could indicate a similar switch for Mac accessories.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Apple faces challenges, Microsoft leverages AI in race for top market cap",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-faces-challenges-microsoft-leverages-ai-in-race-for-top-market-cap-93CH-3876846,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), both established in the 1970s, have taken different paths in the technology sector. Today, Apple continues to focus on consumer devices like the iPhone 15 lineup, while Microsoft is expanding its cloud computing services.

Apple's dominance in consumer electronics has led to significant milestones, including reaching a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018 and recently hitting $3 trillion. Despite these achievements, Apple has been grappling with declining iPhone revenue for three consecutive quarters. Longer iPhone upgrade cycles and economic issues such as inflation and rising interest rates have added to the company's challenges. Furthermore, Apple's stock has seen a 14% drop from its all-time high due to broader market sell-off and internal issues.

On the other hand, Microsoft's valuation is trailing only $180 billion behind Apple's. The company's stock currently trades at a premium to Apple's based on their respective P/E ratios - Microsoft's P/E ratio stands at 31.9 while Apple's is at 28.2.

Microsoft has strategically shifted towards cloud computing services for businesses, resulting in accelerated growth of its Azure platform revenue. The company has also invested $10 billion in OpenAI, positioning itself as a key distributor of AI technologies through its Azure cloud platform and Azure OpenAI Service segment. This move has allowed Microsoft to integrate AI technology across its product portfolio.

The company's plans to expand its AI monetization are evident with tools like Copilot, which was used by 40% of Fortune 100 companies during its beta phase. If Microsoft continues to leverage AI effectively and capitalizes on predictions that AI will add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy by 2030, it could soon surpass Apple's valuation and become the world's most valuable company.

While Apple's services segment contributes only 25% of total revenue, it has been insufficient to counterbalance potential stagnation in the hardware business. Despite these challenges, Apple remains a significant player in the technology sector with its strong consumer device lineup. As both companies continue to evolve, the race for the top market cap is set to intensify.

2022-10-31, IANS,Tata-Wistron deal bolsters India's ‘Make in India’ initiative: Experts,https://in.investing.com/news/tatawistron-deal-bolsters-indias-make-in-india-initiative-experts-3875654,"New Delhi, Oct 31 (IANS) The $135 million Tata-Wistron deal, announced soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the ‘India Mobile Congress 2022’ in New Delhi on October 27, will make Tatas the first Indian company to make iconic Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones in India.According to industry experts, the announcement marks a pivotal milestone in manufacturing within India as it is seen as enhancing India’s pre-eminent position as the world's second-largest smartphone maker.

A slew of initiatives by the government will fuel the growth of manufacturing facilities with its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphone production allowing Indian companies to compete with global electronics makers based in China.

Industry analysts have welcomed the move.

“In the long term, this could mean India finally having a fundamentally strong player in electronics value chain which can fast forward the journey of ‘Making in India’ to next levels by significantly increasing the domestic value addition,” said Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst, Techarc, a research firm tracking technology ecosystem.

At present, the domestic value addition for smartphones is hovering in the range of 18-24 per cent.

“Tata is now strongly positioned to take a solutions approach for designing, developing and manufacturing electronics products in India” Kawoosa added.

The Tata announcement underlines its strategic approach in opting to acquire an operational facility from Wistron.

“As it moves forward, expansion of its Narasapura manufacturing facility near Bengaluru can move at a fast clip as several Indian manufacturers that helped supply machinery can be brought on board, with little dependence on global supply chains,” said another industry analyst.

Currently, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 12 and iPhone SE (second generation) are being manufactured/ assembled at Wistron's factory in Karnataka, which Tatas will take over.

The much-awaited deal has been finalised after strategic considerations in response to the reshaping of the group's product strategy and global manufacturing layout.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, told IANS that Tatas' semiconductor ambitions are serious and came at a very important juncture amid India's digital goals.

""First, they can leverage the semiconductor strength in their EV business and second, their chips can be aligned with Apple in the future and the learning curve will be great for them,"" Pathak said.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative in technology space shot into global prominence with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) stressing that it got the bulk of its components for its successful Chandrayaan-3 mission from firms like L&T, Godrej as well as much smaller tech manufacturers and research laboratories from academic institutions.

Indian academic institutions like South India-based Periyar University and Sona College of Technology have played a vital role in designing critical components for India’s space mission.

Technology firm Vee Technologies, that created critical magnetic stepper motors for Chandrayaan-3 lift off, supplied critical modular anti-static mobile charging assembly units to Wistron for testing mobiles.

Vee Technologies provides precision engineering services for the defence, space, and automotive industries in India.

Recently technology firm VVDN landed a high-end server contract, Dixon expanded Xiaomi smartphone production, and Corning began display glass finishing in India -- all examples of success of the Make in India initiative.

A groundbreaking deal between GE and Hindustan Aeronautics (NS: ) Limited (HAL) struck during Modi’s US visit in June 2022, featuring extensive technology transfer and jet engine manufacturing in India, strengthens India's 'Make in India' narrative.

Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, emphasized the pivotal role of contract manufacturers in creating value, generating employment, and contributing to the economy. As these manufacturers scale up, they will attract component suppliers, potentially establishing ancillary factories in India.

According to experts, India stands out as a potential hub for production amidst escalating US-China tensions, owing to its substantial internal market and skilled labour force.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Google CEO defends against antitrust charges, cites competition and user choice",https://in.investing.com/news/google-ceo-defends-against-antitrust-charges-cites-competition-and-user-choice-93CH-3875522,"Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), on Tuesday defended Google against allegations of antitrust practices brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), emphasizing the company's competition with rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and evolving online behaviors. Despite Google's 90% market share, Pichai argued that the company faces significant competition and has always prioritized user choice.

The DOJ alleges that Google stifled potential competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and DuckDuckGo by paying $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various devices. This figure includes a substantial payment between $4 billion and $8 billion to Apple, a result of the iPhone's significant market share.

During the renegotiation of a contract with Apple in 2016, Pichai expressed concerns about ""query cannibalisation,"" a situation where Apple could potentially redirect Safari queries to other platforms. He underscored that Google developed Chrome and Android to enhance web access and promote Google's search, thereby bringing hundreds of millions of users online. Other companies, including Microsoft with its Edge browser, can use Chrome's underlying technology and Android for free.

The government questioned why Google needs to pay billions for default status if its product is superior. They implied that Google uses its prime position to extract more from advertisers. Pichai had previously expressed concerns about being the default and favored offering a choice, as indicated in 2007 internal emails.

In Monday's testimony, Pichai discussed Google's strategies to maintain its dominance in online search. The government alleges that Google locked out rivals via exclusive deals with phone manufacturers and web browser-makers. During his cross-examination, Pichai confirmed that while Google does not prohibit choice screens, for those agreeing to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA), providing a choice screen would not align with the agreement.

Pichai also addressed concerns about employee turnover, requesting monthly reports of losses to competitors, especially Apple. The DOJ criticized Google's policy of not automatically retaining internal chat messages, alleging that Google systematically destroyed instant message chats through its history-off option.

A decision on the case is expected next year.

During the US Justice Department’s hearing late on Monday, Pichai said that Google Search, Android and Chrome are not only good products, but are good for the Internet as a whole, reports The Verge.

“People use Android to build smartphones at prices as low as $30, and it’s what has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,” said Pichai.

Google spent around $26.3 billion in 2021 to remain the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones and platforms.

The figure came out during the US Justice Department’s cross-examination of Google’s search head, Prabhakar Raghavan, last week.

At the beginning of Pichai’s testimony, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein had him walk through his life and work history, from growing up in India to running one of the largest companies on the planet. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and Schmidtlein asked why he believed in the company.

“I saw the potential. I realised for the first time the internet would touch most of humanity and it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Pichai said.

When the lawyers asked about Google’s deal with Apple, Pichai said that “we wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a long-term deal, the concept of default was preserved in a consistent way.”

Google was worried at the time that Apple might make a deal with, say, Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“Google also worried about Apple’s new Suggestions feature in Safari, which would help users navigate directly for some queries rather than sending everyone to Google’s results page,” according to the report.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

2022-10-30, Investing.com,"US stocks rebound amid anticipation of Fed's decision, Apple's earnings",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stocks-rebound-amid-anticipation-of-feds-decision-apples-earnings-93CH-3874679,"After a challenging week marked by inconsistent earnings from large tech firms and market corrections, US stocks showed signs of recovery on Monday. The , , and all bounced back, each rising by about 0.7% to 0.8%. This rebound was influenced by investors' anticipation of the Federal Reserve's policy decision, potential impacts on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s earnings due to China's iPhone restrictions, and the October US jobs report.

Under its ""higher for longer"" policy, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates steady on Wednesday. This expectation comes as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation indicator, exhibited a continued cooling of prices in September. The PCE Index is a critical factor that will significantly influence the interest rate decision on Nov. 1.

In Friday's midday trading, despite early gains being reversed, the S&P 500 held steady while the Nasdaq Composite managed to rebound by approximately 0.9%. This resilience was attributed to positive earnings reports from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ), and was exhibited despite the market's movement towards correction territory. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped around 0.6%.

The resilience of US consumers was indicated by McDonald's (NYSE: ) outperforming Q3 earnings estimates despite high borrowing costs. Additionally, the de-escalating Israel-Gaza conflict led to a dip in oil prices, encouraging investors to re-enter markets.

After a tough period characterized by mixed Big Tech results and market corrections, the stock market now looks to the Federal Reserve and Apple for a potential positive turnaround.

The changes are reportedly in compliance with European Commission regulations requiring USB-C usage. This information was shared by Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter, published Today.

The limited upgrade may disappoint customers due to the $550 price tag of the current model which already lacks certain features due to aging hardware. The recently released AirPods Pro 2 offers Adaptive Audio functionalities like Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness powered by an advanced H2 chip. These features are absent in the AirPods Max.

Gurman suggests that there are no immediate plans to add the H2 chip to the new AirPods Max model at its launch but leaves room for potential changes. The older H1 chip will continue to power these headphones.

Looking ahead, substantial upgrades are anticipated for other products in Apple's AirPods lineup next year. These include fourth-generation AirPods with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC), a new design, case, and enhanced audio capabilities. Additionally, Apple reportedly plans to launch the AirPods Pro 3 in 2025 with a fresh design and an additional chip.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Apple faces challenges, Microsoft leverages AI in race for top market cap",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-faces-challenges-microsoft-leverages-ai-in-race-for-top-market-cap-93CH-3876846,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), both established in the 1970s, have taken different paths in the technology sector. Today, Apple continues to focus on consumer devices like the iPhone 15 lineup, while Microsoft is expanding its cloud computing services.

Apple's dominance in consumer electronics has led to significant milestones, including reaching a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018 and recently hitting $3 trillion. Despite these achievements, Apple has been grappling with declining iPhone revenue for three consecutive quarters. Longer iPhone upgrade cycles and economic issues such as inflation and rising interest rates have added to the company's challenges. Furthermore, Apple's stock has seen a 14% drop from its all-time high due to broader market sell-off and internal issues.

On the other hand, Microsoft's valuation is trailing only $180 billion behind Apple's. The company's stock currently trades at a premium to Apple's based on their respective P/E ratios - Microsoft's P/E ratio stands at 31.9 while Apple's is at 28.2.

Microsoft has strategically shifted towards cloud computing services for businesses, resulting in accelerated growth of its Azure platform revenue. The company has also invested $10 billion in OpenAI, positioning itself as a key distributor of AI technologies through its Azure cloud platform and Azure OpenAI Service segment. This move has allowed Microsoft to integrate AI technology across its product portfolio.

The company's plans to expand its AI monetization are evident with tools like Copilot, which was used by 40% of Fortune 100 companies during its beta phase. If Microsoft continues to leverage AI effectively and capitalizes on predictions that AI will add between $7 trillion and $200 trillion to the global economy by 2030, it could soon surpass Apple's valuation and become the world's most valuable company.

While Apple's services segment contributes only 25% of total revenue, it has been insufficient to counterbalance potential stagnation in the hardware business. Despite these challenges, Apple remains a significant player in the technology sector with its strong consumer device lineup. As both companies continue to evolve, the race for the top market cap is set to intensify.

All-New GPU Features Dynamic Caching, Mesh Shading, and Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing

The next-generation GPU inside the M3 family of chips represents the largest leap forward in graphics architecture for Apple silicon. It features Dynamic Caching that, unlike traditional GPUs, allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time. With Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games.

With the M3 family of chips, hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time. Ray tracing models the properties of light as it interacts with a scene, allowing apps to create extremely realistic and physically accurate images. This, along with the new graphics architecture, allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5x the speed of the M1 family of chips. Game developers can use ray tracing for more accurate shadows and reflections, creating deeply immersive environments. Additionally, the new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading to the Mac, delivering greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, and enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. This breakthrough GPU architecture enables all of these enhancements and features while maintaining Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency. In fact, the M3 GPU is able to deliver the same performance as M1 using nearly half the power, and up to 65 percent more performance at its peak.

A Faster and More Efficient CPU

The next-generation CPU in M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max features architectural improvements to the performance and efficiency cores. The performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than those in the M1 family, so tasks like compiling and testing millions of lines of code in Xcode® are even faster, and musicians can use hundreds of audio tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments in Logic Pro®. The efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the efficiency cores in M1, so everyday tasks are faster than ever, while allowing the system to maximize battery life. Together, these cores create a CPU that delivers the same multithreaded performance as M1 using as little as half the power, and up to 35 percent more performance at peak power.

Unrivaled Unified Memory Architecture, up to 128GB

Each chip in the M3 family features a unified memory architecture, a hallmark of Apple silicon. This delivers high bandwidth, low latency, and unmatched power efficiency. Having a single pool of memory within a custom package means all of the technologies in the chip can access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory, further improving performance and efficiency, and reducing the amount of memory a system requires for the majority of tasks. Additionally, support for up to 128GB of memory unlocks workflows previously not possible on a laptop, such as AI developers working with even larger transformer models with billions of parameters.

Custom Engines for AI and Video

M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max also have an enhanced Neural Engine to accelerate powerful machine learning (ML) models. The Neural Engine is up to 60 percent faster than in the M1 family of chips, making AI/ML workflows even faster while keeping data on device to preserve privacy. Powerful AI image processing tools, like noise reduction and super resolution in Topaz, get even faster. Scene edit detection in Adobe Premiere and Smart Conform in Final Cut Pro® also see a boost in performance.

All three chips in the M3 family also have an advanced media engine, providing hardware acceleration to the most popular video codecs, including H.264, HEVC, ProRes®, and ProRes RAW. And for the first time, the media engine supports AV1 decoding, enabling power-efficient playback of streaming services to further extend battery life.

2022-10-31, IANS,Tata-Wistron deal bolsters India's ‘Make in India’ initiative: Experts,https://in.investing.com/news/tatawistron-deal-bolsters-indias-make-in-india-initiative-experts-3875654,"New Delhi, Oct 31 (IANS) The $135 million Tata-Wistron deal, announced soon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened the ‘India Mobile Congress 2022’ in New Delhi on October 27, will make Tatas the first Indian company to make iconic Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones in India.According to industry experts, the announcement marks a pivotal milestone in manufacturing within India as it is seen as enhancing India’s pre-eminent position as the world's second-largest smartphone maker.

A slew of initiatives by the government will fuel the growth of manufacturing facilities with its Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphone production allowing Indian companies to compete with global electronics makers based in China.

Industry analysts have welcomed the move.

“In the long term, this could mean India finally having a fundamentally strong player in electronics value chain which can fast forward the journey of ‘Making in India’ to next levels by significantly increasing the domestic value addition,” said Faisal Kawoosa, Chief Analyst, Techarc, a research firm tracking technology ecosystem.

At present, the domestic value addition for smartphones is hovering in the range of 18-24 per cent.

“Tata is now strongly positioned to take a solutions approach for designing, developing and manufacturing electronics products in India” Kawoosa added.

The Tata announcement underlines its strategic approach in opting to acquire an operational facility from Wistron.

“As it moves forward, expansion of its Narasapura manufacturing facility near Bengaluru can move at a fast clip as several Indian manufacturers that helped supply machinery can be brought on board, with little dependence on global supply chains,” said another industry analyst.

Currently, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 12 and iPhone SE (second generation) are being manufactured/ assembled at Wistron's factory in Karnataka, which Tatas will take over.

The much-awaited deal has been finalised after strategic considerations in response to the reshaping of the group's product strategy and global manufacturing layout.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, told IANS that Tatas' semiconductor ambitions are serious and came at a very important juncture amid India's digital goals.

""First, they can leverage the semiconductor strength in their EV business and second, their chips can be aligned with Apple in the future and the learning curve will be great for them,"" Pathak said.

The ‘Make in India’ initiative in technology space shot into global prominence with Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) stressing that it got the bulk of its components for its successful Chandrayaan-3 mission from firms like L&T, Godrej as well as much smaller tech manufacturers and research laboratories from academic institutions.

Indian academic institutions like South India-based Periyar University and Sona College of Technology have played a vital role in designing critical components for India’s space mission.

Technology firm Vee Technologies, that created critical magnetic stepper motors for Chandrayaan-3 lift off, supplied critical modular anti-static mobile charging assembly units to Wistron for testing mobiles.

Vee Technologies provides precision engineering services for the defence, space, and automotive industries in India.

Recently technology firm VVDN landed a high-end server contract, Dixon expanded Xiaomi smartphone production, and Corning began display glass finishing in India -- all examples of success of the Make in India initiative.

A groundbreaking deal between GE and Hindustan Aeronautics (NS: ) Limited (HAL) struck during Modi’s US visit in June 2022, featuring extensive technology transfer and jet engine manufacturing in India, strengthens India's 'Make in India' narrative.

Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, emphasized the pivotal role of contract manufacturers in creating value, generating employment, and contributing to the economy. As these manufacturers scale up, they will attract component suppliers, potentially establishing ancillary factories in India.

According to experts, India stands out as a potential hub for production amidst escalating US-China tensions, owing to its substantial internal market and skilled labour force.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Google CEO defends against antitrust charges, cites competition and user choice",https://in.investing.com/news/google-ceo-defends-against-antitrust-charges-cites-competition-and-user-choice-93CH-3875522,"Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), on Tuesday defended Google against allegations of antitrust practices brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), emphasizing the company's competition with rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and evolving online behaviors. Despite Google's 90% market share, Pichai argued that the company faces significant competition and has always prioritized user choice.

The DOJ alleges that Google stifled potential competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and DuckDuckGo by paying $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various devices. This figure includes a substantial payment between $4 billion and $8 billion to Apple, a result of the iPhone's significant market share.

During the renegotiation of a contract with Apple in 2016, Pichai expressed concerns about ""query cannibalisation,"" a situation where Apple could potentially redirect Safari queries to other platforms. He underscored that Google developed Chrome and Android to enhance web access and promote Google's search, thereby bringing hundreds of millions of users online. Other companies, including Microsoft with its Edge browser, can use Chrome's underlying technology and Android for free.

The government questioned why Google needs to pay billions for default status if its product is superior. They implied that Google uses its prime position to extract more from advertisers. Pichai had previously expressed concerns about being the default and favored offering a choice, as indicated in 2007 internal emails.

In Monday's testimony, Pichai discussed Google's strategies to maintain its dominance in online search. The government alleges that Google locked out rivals via exclusive deals with phone manufacturers and web browser-makers. During his cross-examination, Pichai confirmed that while Google does not prohibit choice screens, for those agreeing to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA), providing a choice screen would not align with the agreement.

Pichai also addressed concerns about employee turnover, requesting monthly reports of losses to competitors, especially Apple. The DOJ criticized Google's policy of not automatically retaining internal chat messages, alleging that Google systematically destroyed instant message chats through its history-off option.

A decision on the case is expected next year.

During the US Justice Department’s hearing late on Monday, Pichai said that Google Search, Android and Chrome are not only good products, but are good for the Internet as a whole, reports The Verge.

“People use Android to build smartphones at prices as low as $30, and it’s what has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,” said Pichai.

Google spent around $26.3 billion in 2021 to remain the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones and platforms.

The figure came out during the US Justice Department’s cross-examination of Google’s search head, Prabhakar Raghavan, last week.

At the beginning of Pichai’s testimony, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein had him walk through his life and work history, from growing up in India to running one of the largest companies on the planet. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and Schmidtlein asked why he believed in the company.

“I saw the potential. I realised for the first time the internet would touch most of humanity and it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Pichai said.

When the lawyers asked about Google’s deal with Apple, Pichai said that “we wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a long-term deal, the concept of default was preserved in a consistent way.”

Google was worried at the time that Apple might make a deal with, say, Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“Google also worried about Apple’s new Suggestions feature in Safari, which would help users navigate directly for some queries rather than sending everyone to Google’s results page,” according to the report.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

The changes are reportedly in compliance with European Commission regulations requiring USB-C usage. This information was shared by Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter, published Today.

The limited upgrade may disappoint customers due to the $550 price tag of the current model which already lacks certain features due to aging hardware. The recently released AirPods Pro 2 offers Adaptive Audio functionalities like Adaptive Noise Control, Personalized Volume, and Conversation Awareness powered by an advanced H2 chip. These features are absent in the AirPods Max.

Gurman suggests that there are no immediate plans to add the H2 chip to the new AirPods Max model at its launch but leaves room for potential changes. The older H1 chip will continue to power these headphones.

Looking ahead, substantial upgrades are anticipated for other products in Apple's AirPods lineup next year. These include fourth-generation AirPods with Active Noise Cancelling (ANC), a new design, case, and enhanced audio capabilities. Additionally, Apple reportedly plans to launch the AirPods Pro 3 in 2025 with a fresh design and an additional chip.

“In aggregate, the Q3 earnings season has been one of the worst in a while, not so much in terms of reported EPS vs. expectations but instead due to the totality of the reports,” analysts at Vital Knowledge added.

On September 30, the estimated YoY earnings decline for the S&P 500 for Q3 2022 was -0.3%. Nine sectors are reporting higher earnings today compared to September 30 due to positive EPS surprises and upward revisions to EPS estimates.

What analysts are saying

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our view can be boiled down to “things are so bad, they’re good”. We’re taking the commentary from CEOs/CFOs over the government’s GDP report as a measure of the economy and as a result, yields have much more downside than upside risks (the data will eventually catch up to what companies are seeing on the ground). Meanwhile, sentiment has rarely been this bleak, prices are oversold, and selling pressure is exhausted – this makes for a favorable technical setup.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “We think the S&P 500 price action into year-end is more likely to come down to where the average stock is trading rather than rallying to higher levels

because breadth typically leads price. Based on our fundamental and technical analysis, we remain comfortable with our long-standing 3,900 year-end target for the S&P 500, which implies a 17x multiple on our 2024 EPS forecast of approximately $230.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “Although we expect headwinds to discount rates and balance sheets to persist, we would view a substantial further downgrade to the growth outlook as a buying opportunity.”

BTIG’s analysts: “We have been skeptical of the seasonal rally and even if November is positive, it likely won’t be a smooth/easy rally and could very well start from a lower level… Breaking below [4130] opens the door towards 3,950-4,000. Either way it’s likely to be a November to Remember.”

Oppenheimer’s analysts: “The breach of the S&P 500’s 200-day average indicates that the correction since July hasn’t run its course. We see 4,050 as next support and, to mark improvement, we’re watching for a key reversal day, or a rally back above 4,240. Most interesting about the correction is that risk has been dragged lower by safety. This is why we believe long-term opportunity is being presented.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Absent pre-emptive rate cuts by global central banks, we see risks compounding with peak effect of restrictive monetary policy still ahead… Real rates suggest equity market is overvalued.”"

By 05:52 ET, the futures traded 1.5% lower at $84.28 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.4% to $87.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks ended Friday up 3% after Israel stepped up a ground assault on Gaza, but the contracts still registered hefty losses over the course of the week as there were few signs that this conflict will expand into a wider regional war.

Beyond the violence in the Middle East, traders are gearing up for Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are anticipating a more moderate figure of 182,000, although this would still be consistent with a robust labor market.

4. HSBC announces fresh share buybacks

HSBC has unveiled an extra $3 billion in share buybacks, bringing its total returns to shareholders this year to $7B, as the lender said it has reaped the benefits from higher interest rates.

The move came as the bank reported profit before tax in the third quarter of $7.7B, missing analysts' estimates of $8.1B, but jumping from $4.5B in the corresponding period last year. Revenue also surged by 40% to $16.2B.

In a statement, Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn noted that the London-based group saw ""broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies, supported by the interest rate environment.""

He added that HSBC, which retains strong ties with East Asia, continues to monitor risks related to a liquidity crisis hitting China's housing sector. The company's provisions for loan losses amounted to $1.1B, with $500M of this total related to its commercial real estate portfolio in China.

5. Evergrande given deadline for new restructuring plan

China Evergrande Group has been given one final chance to come up with a deal to appease its creditors or face liquidation, as the indebted developer said it was working on a revised plan to restructure its operations.

A court in Hong Kong agreed to push back a hearing to wind up Evergrande to Dec. 4, although High Court Judge Linda Chan said this will be the ""last opportunity"" for the company to present a ""concrete"" overhaul proposal. If not, Chan warned that Evergrande would likely be wound up.

Evergrande, long a symbol of the crisis facing China's property sector, saw a recent $23B plan to restructure its offshore debt scrapped after its founder Hui Ka Yan was confirmed to be under investigation for suspected criminal activities. The company, which previously defaulted on its offshore in 2021, faces over $300B in liabilities.

A lawyer for Evergrande noted that it now aims to ""monetize the value"" of its Hong Kong-listed property services and electric vehicle divisions, saying it would help avert possible regulatory issues."

Amazon's shares increased by over 6% following positive investor sentiment towards its Q3 update and Q4 forecast.

Macquarie Group (OTC: ) is also set to release weak half-year results.

“Vendors should remain flexible and adaptable in their strategies to seize growth opportunities in specific regions. Additionally, close monitoring of end demand in different regions is needed to strategically optimise resource allocation and avoid disruptions,” said Lucas Zhong, research analyst.

In the saturated market competition, vendors must continuously enhance their capabilities and focus on profit and product portfolio optimisation, he added.

The global smartphone market fell slightly by 1 per cent to 293.4 million units in Q3 with vendors pushing new models following a healthy inventory level in Q2.

Samsung (KS: ) held the pole position and shipped 57.4 million units with a 20 per cent market share.

Xiaomi took third place, shipping 41.5 million units, achieving an annual growth of 2 per cent, owing to strong performance in emerging markets.

OPPO (including OnePlus) secured the fourth position with 26.4 million units of shipment, capturing 9 per cent market share.

“Rising demand for fresh offerings in emerging markets is propelling brands and channels forward as the holiday season approaches,” said Sanyam Chaurasia, senior analyst.

“Xiaomi and the TRANSSION Group maintained their strong performance from the previous quarter and were the sole brands among the top five to experience growth,” he added.

Vendors are seeking opportunities to solidify their positioning in the premium market.

However, as foldable smartphone options continue to increase, this trend poses a challenge to Samsung's current dominance in the same market.

“OPPO strategically introduced the Find N3 and OnePlus Open models in different regions, demonstrating Android brands' ambition to capture the global foldable market,” said Zhong.

Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Federal Reserve meeting

Investors will be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s on Wednesday, eager to hear policymakers' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.

Most investors are betting that the Fed is done tightening after Chair Jerome Powell said that rising long-term yields reduce the need for further rate increases, though some believe another hike could come when the central bank meets again in December.

Any indications that the Fed intends to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the .

The index has fallen more than 10% since hitting a year-high in late July, though is still up nearly 8% on the year.

Nonfarm payrolls data

The key piece of economic data this week will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are expecting more moderate jobs growth of , which is still consistent with a robust labor market.

The unemployment rate is expected to remain at , while wage growth is expected to ease to year-on-year, which would mark a post-pandemic period low. This could help bolster the Fed’s view that price pressures are easing and that it doesn't need to raise interest rates any further.

Ahead of Friday’s data, market participants will be looking at data on third-quarter employment costs on Tuesday for signs that wage growth is moderating.

Earnings

Apple (NASDAQ: ) tops the bill in what is set to be another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting on Thursday.

Shares of Apple, the largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year along with shares of other megacap U.S. tech and growth companies.

Third quarter earnings season has seen disappointments from some Big Tech names, with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) slumping after their respective reports. The tech-heavy is down 11% from its high, though still up nearly 30% on the year.

Consumers' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include McDonald's (NYSE: ) on Monday, Caterpillar (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ) on Tuesday, Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) on Thursday.

Bank of England

The Bank of England is to hold its penultimate of the year on Thursday, where officials will need to decide whether to resume raising interest rates, having kept them on hold in September after 14 hikes in a row.

Investors are expecting the BoE to keep rates on hold at a 15-year high of 5.25%, while leaving the door open to further hikes if necessary. Policymakers are also expected to reiterate that rates will need to remain around current levels for quite some time to come despite growing signs that the economy is flat-lining.

The BoE will update its quarterly forecasts which in August showed economic growth of just 0.5% in both 2022 and 2024. Governor Andrew Bailey spoke earlier this month of a ""very subdued"" outlook.

Eurozone inflation and GDP

The European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold on Thursday after the steepest pace of rate hikes on record and will now be looking ahead to Tuesday’s data on inflation and gross domestic product ahead of its final meeting of the year.

Preliminary data on consumer price inflation is expected to show the headline rate slowing to in October, coming closer to the ECB’s 2% target, even if high energy costs continue to pose an upside risk.

GDP data the same day is expected to show that the Eurozone economy contracted by in the third quarter, for an annual rate of growth of just .

On Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde hinted at steady policy ahead and pushed back against rate cut expectations.

The move comes as the company seeks to lessen its dependence on third-party operating systems and marks a significant step towards its goal of creating a “Human x Car x Home” ecosystem.

The HyperOS initiative was unveiled at the “Leap Beyond the Moment” themed event. It represents five years of effort by approximately 5,000 software engineers, initiated in 2017 to address interoperability challenges in the Internet of Things era.

However, investors should note that the index is not exclusively tech-focused.

While the Invesco QQQ Trust is frequently favored by investors seeking broad market exposure, it carries a notable concentration risk due to its significant exposure to high-profile tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"".

2022-10-27, IANS,Tatas set to write new India iPhone manufacturing story post Wistron plant acquisition,https://in.investing.com/news/tatas-set-to-write-new-india-iphone-manufacturing-story-post-wistron-plant-acquisition-3870905,"New Delhi, Oct 27 (IANS) With Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron selling its India operations to Tata Group for $125 million, Tata Electronics is going to become the first Indian company to manufacture new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones in the country, which is a major fillip to the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. The company said in its regulatory filing that it will sell a 100 per cent stake in the unit Wistron InfoComm Manufacturing (India) Pvt. to Tata Electronics Pvt., following the board approval.

The much-awaited deal has been finalised after strategic considerations in response to the reshaping of the group's product strategy and global manufacturing layout.

Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, said that within just two and a half years, Tata Group will start making iPhones from India for domestic and global markets.

""PM Narendra Modi’s visionary PLI scheme has already propelled India into becoming a trusted and major hub for smartphone manufacturing and exports. Congratulations to the Tata team for taking over Wistron operations,"" the minister posted on X.

He said that this is a ""great going for Apple in building a global supply chain from India with Indian companies at its helm"".

""MeitY stands fully in support in growth of global Indian electronics companies that will, in turn, support global electronic brands that want to make India their trusted manufacturing and talent partner,"" Chandrasekhar added.

Industry experts said that with their ambition on semiconductors and EVs, it only makes sense for the Tata Group to gain expertise in manufacturing high-end iPhones in the country.

""With the Wistron acquisition, Tata Group will get a leg-up on its electronics manufacturing ambitions with the iPhones, and the possibility of manufacturing top-end iPhone models as well in the near future. We anticipate ‘Make in India’ to gain further momentum, and India to emerge as a major fulcrum in the global electronics value chain,"" Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

In the years ahead, the Tata Group has the potential to solidify their position as a pivotal player in the iPhone manufacturing ecosystem.

Wistron's factory in Karnataka, that employs about 12,000 people, constitutes a major chunk of its business in the country.

As the iPhone consumption increases in the country, Apple needs more suppliers to ramp up production here, as it reportedly aims to take away a significant chunk of manufacturing from China to countries like India and Vietnam.

Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year, according to latest data.

Apple iPhone shipments grew 68 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of this year in the country.

CMR estimates the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter (October-December period) to hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

For the first time, ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units were exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch last month.

Apple received tremendous response to the iPhone 15 series in the country -- nearly 50 per cent more from last year.

Apple had set a June quarter record in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones, according to CEO Tim Cook.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, told IANS that Tatas' semiconductor ambitions are serious and came at a very important juncture amid India's digital goals.

""First, they can leverage the semiconductor strength in their EV business and second, their chips can be aligned with Apple in the future and the learning curve will be great for them,"" Pathak told IANS.

India is now the second-biggest manufacturing hub for mobile phones due to heavy investment from original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers and companies dealing in components and parts, according to Counterpoint.

The country saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the current fiscal year (FY24), government and industry data showed.

As per the estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year, with Apple leading the market with more than 50 per cent in FY24.

The week will culminate with the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's November policy meeting on Wednesday, followed by a rates announcement and a media session with Chairman Jerome Powell.

The Fed's benchmark lending rate is projected to remain at 5.25%-5.5%. However, market participants are eagerly awaiting Powell's insights on inflation trends and the potential for a rate hike in early 2024.

Simultaneously, the Treasury's quarterly refunding statement will provide details on the volume of marketable securities to be issued in the upcoming months. This move is aimed at funding the record budget deficit of $2 trillion. Market forecasts suggest a refunding total of around $114 billion, which would increase the size of benchmark 10-year auctions to about $41 billion and long-bond sales to $25 billion.

In addition to these economic indicators, as many as 164 companies are expected to report their third-quarter results this week. Overall earnings are projected to increase by 4.3% to $478.2 billion. Key earnings reports from Apple (NASDAQ: ), Mcdonald's, Eli Lilly (NYSE: ), CVS Health (NYSE: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) are among those anticipated.

The latter is expected to indicate that 188,000 new jobs were added last month. This would represent a decrease from 336,000 in September, while average hourly earnings are projected to have risen by 4%.

“Healthy earnings season could have provided air cover for stocks to withstand the macro turmoil, but instead EPS reports compounded the market’s doubt and pain,” analysts at Vital Knowledge wrote in a report.

The sank 2.5% to hit fresh 5-month lows. The index is now testing below the key support near 4200 and the 100-WMA that sits around 4180.

Similarly, the lost 2.1% to close below the descending trend line that connects lower highs. The next support is the 200-WMA near 31800.

Finally, the Index fell 2% as Amazon’s (NASDAQ: ) rally on Friday helped the tech-heavy index to pare some losses from earlier in the week. The index previously touched the 100-WMA for the first time since May this year.

Looking forward to this week, the two key catalysts are the on Wednesday and Apple’s (NASDAQ: ) earnings report on Thursday after market close. Moreover, investors will look forward to the on Tuesday, the for October, and the event on Thursday. The busy week will conclude with the for October on Friday.

Earnings season in full swing

Around half of the S&P 500 companies reported so far, with 78% having reported a positive EPS surprise. Moreover, 28 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance, while 14 companies have issued positive EPS guidance.

The blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 2.7% in Q3 2022. If this rate holds, it will be the first quarter of YoY earnings growth reported by the index since Q3 2022, according to FactSet.

“In aggregate, the Q3 earnings season has been one of the worst in a while, not so much in terms of reported EPS vs. expectations but instead due to the totality of the reports,” analysts at Vital Knowledge added.

On September 30, the estimated YoY earnings decline for the S&P 500 for Q3 2022 was -0.3%. Nine sectors are reporting higher earnings today compared to September 30 due to positive EPS surprises and upward revisions to EPS estimates.

What analysts are saying

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our view can be boiled down to “things are so bad, they’re good”. We’re taking the commentary from CEOs/CFOs over the government’s GDP report as a measure of the economy and as a result, yields have much more downside than upside risks (the data will eventually catch up to what companies are seeing on the ground). Meanwhile, sentiment has rarely been this bleak, prices are oversold, and selling pressure is exhausted – this makes for a favorable technical setup.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “We think the S&P 500 price action into year-end is more likely to come down to where the average stock is trading rather than rallying to higher levels

because breadth typically leads price. Based on our fundamental and technical analysis, we remain comfortable with our long-standing 3,900 year-end target for the S&P 500, which implies a 17x multiple on our 2024 EPS forecast of approximately $230.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “Although we expect headwinds to discount rates and balance sheets to persist, we would view a substantial further downgrade to the growth outlook as a buying opportunity.”

BTIG’s analysts: “We have been skeptical of the seasonal rally and even if November is positive, it likely won’t be a smooth/easy rally and could very well start from a lower level… Breaking below [4130] opens the door towards 3,950-4,000. Either way it’s likely to be a November to Remember.”

Oppenheimer’s analysts: “The breach of the S&P 500’s 200-day average indicates that the correction since July hasn’t run its course. We see 4,050 as next support and, to mark improvement, we’re watching for a key reversal day, or a rally back above 4,240. Most interesting about the correction is that risk has been dragged lower by safety. This is why we believe long-term opportunity is being presented.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Absent pre-emptive rate cuts by global central banks, we see risks compounding with peak effect of restrictive monetary policy still ahead… Real rates suggest equity market is overvalued.”"

2022-10-30, Investing.com,"Futures higher, HSBC share buybacks, Evergrande reprieve - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-higher-hsbc-share-buybacks-evergrande-reprieve--whats-moving-markets-3873742,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point higher, with investors preparing for a busy week of central bank decisions, economic data, and company earnings. Meanwhile, HSBC rolls out fresh share buybacks despite missing third-quarter profit expectations and a Hong Kong court gives embattled developer China Evergrande (HK: ) one last opportunity to present a new restructuring plan or face liquidation.

1. Futures higher with Fed decision ahead

U.S. stock futures rose on Monday ahead of whirlwind week marked by a key interest rate decision from the Federal Reserve, major corporate results and crucial employment data.

At 05:52 ET (09:52 GMT), the contract added 157 points or 0.5%, gained 26 points or 0.6%, and jumped by 111 points or 0.8%.

The benchmark , tech-heavy and the 30-stock remain on pace for a negative October heading into the final trading days of the month. A sharp increase in U.S. Treasury yields has contributed to the sell-off, weighing in particular on shares in technology companies.

Attention now turns to the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate announcement on Wednesday, with traders mostly expecting the U.S. central bank to signal that it has finished hiking borrowing costs this year in the wake of the surge in Treasury yields.

2. Apple set to headline weekly earnings

Markets will also be keeping an eye on quarterly results from several large U.S. companies this week, including tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The iPhone maker, which has seen its shares slump by 15% from its 52-week high, is due to release its fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.

Investors fear that pressures could be mounting on Apple's Chinese operations amid mounting competition from rival Huawei and a reported crackdown on the use of iPhones by government officials. However, these issues may be offset by an expected acceleration in demand for the company's popular services businesses.

Consumers' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include burger giant McDonald's (NYSE:NYSE: ) on Monday, construction group Caterpillar (NYSE:NYSE: ) and drugmaker Pfizer (NYSE:NYSE: ) on Tuesday, snacks company Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, and coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly (NYSE:NYSE: ) on Thursday.



3. Oil drops as busy week starts

Oil prices fell Monday as traders adopted a cautious stance at the start of a week that includes the Fed policy meeting and all-important economic data.

By 05:52 ET, the futures traded 1.5% lower at $84.28 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.4% to $87.97 a barrel.

Both benchmarks ended Friday up 3% after Israel stepped up a ground assault on Gaza, but the contracts still registered hefty losses over the course of the week as there were few signs that this conflict will expand into a wider regional war.

Beyond the violence in the Middle East, traders are gearing up for Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are anticipating a more moderate figure of 182,000, although this would still be consistent with a robust labor market.

4. HSBC announces fresh share buybacks

HSBC has unveiled an extra $3 billion in share buybacks, bringing its total returns to shareholders this year to $7B, as the lender said it has reaped the benefits from higher interest rates.

The move came as the bank reported profit before tax in the third quarter of $7.7B, missing analysts' estimates of $8.1B, but jumping from $4.5B in the corresponding period last year. Revenue also surged by 40% to $16.2B.

In a statement, Group Chief Executive Noel Quinn noted that the London-based group saw ""broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies, supported by the interest rate environment.""

He added that HSBC, which retains strong ties with East Asia, continues to monitor risks related to a liquidity crisis hitting China's housing sector. The company's provisions for loan losses amounted to $1.1B, with $500M of this total related to its commercial real estate portfolio in China.

5. Evergrande given deadline for new restructuring plan

China Evergrande Group has been given one final chance to come up with a deal to appease its creditors or face liquidation, as the indebted developer said it was working on a revised plan to restructure its operations.

A court in Hong Kong agreed to push back a hearing to wind up Evergrande to Dec. 4, although High Court Judge Linda Chan said this will be the ""last opportunity"" for the company to present a ""concrete"" overhaul proposal. If not, Chan warned that Evergrande would likely be wound up.

Evergrande, long a symbol of the crisis facing China's property sector, saw a recent $23B plan to restructure its offshore debt scrapped after its founder Hui Ka Yan was confirmed to be under investigation for suspected criminal activities. The company, which previously defaulted on its offshore in 2021, faces over $300B in liabilities.

A lawyer for Evergrande noted that it now aims to ""monetize the value"" of its Hong Kong-listed property services and electric vehicle divisions, saying it would help avert possible regulatory issues."

The analysts commented:



""We envision nuances stemming from September (F4Q23) results tracking in line with lowered buy-side expectations, even if modestly lower than sell-side consensus; although, the outlook for December (F1Q24) could be much more muted relative to expectations outlined in sell-side consensus.

Despite the broader market downturn, shares of tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose last week. Amazon's shares increased by over 6% following positive investor sentiment towards its Q3 update and Q4 forecast.

However, not all tech stocks fared well. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: ) all saw weekly losses. Alphabet witnessed a near 10% slump, Nvidia lost around 2% weekly, while Netflix dipped slightly by 0.7%.

In other sectors, Ford Motor Company (NYSE: ) shares plunged due to a negative quarterly report while Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: ) shares also declined following its 'guided' quarterly result. Chevron Corporation (NYSE: ) shares fell over concerns about its quarterly figures and its $US53 agreed bid for Hess Corporation (NYSE: ), registering a weekly loss of more than 13%.

Australia's also saw a decline of 8.4%. Amid these market fluctuations, Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting emerged as a significant stakeholder in Azure Minerals, potentially frustrating SQM's $1.6 billion bid for the same. The proposed merger between Australian Unity Diversified Property Fund and Cromwell Direct Property Fund was abandoned due to volatility in commercial property asset values.

Macquarie Group (OTC: ) is also set to release weak half-year results.

Despite the recent market correction, financial experts like Ryan Detrick from Carson Group emphasize that such market corrections are normal, transient, and less severe than a bear market. The S&P 500 marked its best first seven-month performance since 1997 from January to July, despite the recent pullbacks.

“Vendors should remain flexible and adaptable in their strategies to seize growth opportunities in specific regions. Additionally, close monitoring of end demand in different regions is needed to strategically optimise resource allocation and avoid disruptions,” said Lucas Zhong, research analyst.

In the saturated market competition, vendors must continuously enhance their capabilities and focus on profit and product portfolio optimisation, he added.

The global smartphone market fell slightly by 1 per cent to 293.4 million units in Q3 with vendors pushing new models following a healthy inventory level in Q2.

Samsung (KS: ) held the pole position and shipped 57.4 million units with a 20 per cent market share.

Vendors are seeking opportunities to solidify their positioning in the premium market.

2022-10-29, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3872677,"Investing.com -- It’s going to be a very busy week for investors, with a Federal Reserve meeting, the latest U.S. jobs report and earnings from technology heavyweight Apple that could set the direction for stocks and bonds the rest of the year. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Federal Reserve meeting

Investors will be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s on Wednesday, eager to hear policymakers' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.

Most investors are betting that the Fed is done tightening after Chair Jerome Powell said that rising long-term yields reduce the need for further rate increases, though some believe another hike could come when the central bank meets again in December.

Any indications that the Fed intends to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the .

The index has fallen more than 10% since hitting a year-high in late July, though is still up nearly 8% on the year.

Nonfarm payrolls data

The key piece of economic data this week will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are expecting more moderate jobs growth of , which is still consistent with a robust labor market.

The unemployment rate is expected to remain at , while wage growth is expected to ease to year-on-year, which would mark a post-pandemic period low. This could help bolster the Fed’s view that price pressures are easing and that it doesn't need to raise interest rates any further.

Ahead of Friday’s data, market participants will be looking at data on third-quarter employment costs on Tuesday for signs that wage growth is moderating.

Earnings

Apple (NASDAQ: ) tops the bill in what is set to be another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting on Thursday.

Shares of Apple, the largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year along with shares of other megacap U.S. tech and growth companies.

Third quarter earnings season has seen disappointments from some Big Tech names, with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) slumping after their respective reports. The tech-heavy is down 11% from its high, though still up nearly 30% on the year.

Consumers' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include McDonald's (NYSE: ) on Monday, Caterpillar (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ) on Tuesday, Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) on Thursday.

Bank of England

The Bank of England is to hold its penultimate of the year on Thursday, where officials will need to decide whether to resume raising interest rates, having kept them on hold in September after 14 hikes in a row.

Investors are expecting the BoE to keep rates on hold at a 15-year high of 5.25%, while leaving the door open to further hikes if necessary. Policymakers are also expected to reiterate that rates will need to remain around current levels for quite some time to come despite growing signs that the economy is flat-lining.

The BoE will update its quarterly forecasts which in August showed economic growth of just 0.5% in both 2022 and 2024. Governor Andrew Bailey spoke earlier this month of a ""very subdued"" outlook.

Eurozone inflation and GDP

The European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold on Thursday after the steepest pace of rate hikes on record and will now be looking ahead to Tuesday’s data on inflation and gross domestic product ahead of its final meeting of the year.

Preliminary data on consumer price inflation is expected to show the headline rate slowing to in October, coming closer to the ECB’s 2% target, even if high energy costs continue to pose an upside risk.

GDP data the same day is expected to show that the Eurozone economy contracted by in the third quarter, for an annual rate of growth of just .

2022-10-27, Investing.com,"Xiaomi’s Hyperos Set For October 31 Release, Company Plans Automotive Sector Entry",https://in.investing.com/news/xiaomis-hyperos-set-for-october-31-release-company-plans-automotive-sector-entry-93CH-3871858,"Chinese tech giant Xiaomi (OTC: ) is slated to launch its proprietary operating system, HyperOS, on October 31, alongside a new product lineup. The move comes as the company seeks to lessen its dependence on third-party operating systems and marks a significant step towards its goal of creating a “Human x Car x Home” ecosystem.

The HyperOS initiative was unveiled at the “Leap Beyond the Moment” themed event. It represents five years of effort by approximately 5,000 software engineers, initiated in 2017 to address interoperability challenges in the Internet of Things era. The system focuses on low-level refactoring, cross-end intelligent connectivity, proactive intelligence, and end-to-end security. It integrates Linux with Xiaomi's unique Vela system for enhanced performance and will come pre-installed on numerous products including the Xiaomi 14 Series, Xiaomi Watch S3, and Xiaomi TV S Pro 85″ MiniLED.

The company's shift into the realm of proprietary operating systems mirrors the strategies of tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Huawei who have their unique operating systems. Huawei's HarmonyOS boasts over 60 million users and powers more than 700 million devices globally.

In addition to the launch of HyperOS, Xiaomi is also planning to venture into the automotive sector. CEO Lei Jun announced plans for a car launch next year, without specifying its electric nature. The firm registered a 20% rise in shares in 2022 driven by its economical smartphones featuring the MIUI interface.

Xiaomi's expansion beyond smartphones has already seen it move into appliances and consumer electronics which contributes 22% to its revenue. The introduction of HyperOS is expected to further enhance the stability, power efficiency, processing speed, and security across all Xiaomi devices while enabling seamless content sharing.

The Nasdaq 100, composed of 100 non-financial stocks, is often the preferred listing platform for emerging tech companies, leading to its tech-heavy orientation. However, investors should note that the index is not exclusively tech-focused.

While the Invesco QQQ Trust is frequently favored by investors seeking broad market exposure, it carries a notable concentration risk due to its significant exposure to high-profile tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"". These stocks account for approximately one-third of the portfolio's value. About 43% of the ETF's portfolio is diversified across sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare.

In terms of costs, the Invesco QQQ Trust's 0.2% expense ratio may seem competitive when compared to actively managed mutual funds. However, it falls short when compared to other ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (ASX: ) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF which offer lower expense ratios.

Investors considering the Invesco QQQ Trust for quick access to top Nasdaq 100 stocks should weigh these factors – its concentration risk and higher expense ratio – before investing.

2022-10-27, IANS,Tatas set to write new India iPhone manufacturing story post Wistron plant acquisition,https://in.investing.com/news/tatas-set-to-write-new-india-iphone-manufacturing-story-post-wistron-plant-acquisition-3870905,"New Delhi, Oct 27 (IANS) With Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Wistron selling its India operations to Tata Group for $125 million, Tata Electronics is going to become the first Indian company to manufacture new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones in the country, which is a major fillip to the government’s ‘Make in India’ initiative. The company said in its regulatory filing that it will sell a 100 per cent stake in the unit Wistron InfoComm Manufacturing (India) Pvt. to Tata Electronics Pvt., following the board approval.

The much-awaited deal has been finalised after strategic considerations in response to the reshaping of the group's product strategy and global manufacturing layout.

Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, said that within just two and a half years, Tata Group will start making iPhones from India for domestic and global markets.

""PM Narendra Modi’s visionary PLI scheme has already propelled India into becoming a trusted and major hub for smartphone manufacturing and exports. Congratulations to the Tata team for taking over Wistron operations,"" the minister posted on X.

He said that this is a ""great going for Apple in building a global supply chain from India with Indian companies at its helm"".

""MeitY stands fully in support in growth of global Indian electronics companies that will, in turn, support global electronic brands that want to make India their trusted manufacturing and talent partner,"" Chandrasekhar added.

Industry experts said that with their ambition on semiconductors and EVs, it only makes sense for the Tata Group to gain expertise in manufacturing high-end iPhones in the country.

""With the Wistron acquisition, Tata Group will get a leg-up on its electronics manufacturing ambitions with the iPhones, and the possibility of manufacturing top-end iPhone models as well in the near future. We anticipate ‘Make in India’ to gain further momentum, and India to emerge as a major fulcrum in the global electronics value chain,"" Prabhu Ram, Head–Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

In the years ahead, the Tata Group has the potential to solidify their position as a pivotal player in the iPhone manufacturing ecosystem.

Wistron's factory in Karnataka, that employs about 12,000 people, constitutes a major chunk of its business in the country.

As the iPhone consumption increases in the country, Apple needs more suppliers to ramp up production here, as it reportedly aims to take away a significant chunk of manufacturing from China to countries like India and Vietnam.

Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year, according to latest data.

Apple iPhone shipments grew 68 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of this year in the country.

CMR estimates the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter (October-December period) to hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

For the first time, ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units were exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch last month.

Apple received tremendous response to the iPhone 15 series in the country -- nearly 50 per cent more from last year.

Apple had set a June quarter record in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones, according to CEO Tim Cook.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, told IANS that Tatas' semiconductor ambitions are serious and came at a very important juncture amid India's digital goals.

""First, they can leverage the semiconductor strength in their EV business and second, their chips can be aligned with Apple in the future and the learning curve will be great for them,"" Pathak told IANS.

India is now the second-biggest manufacturing hub for mobile phones due to heavy investment from original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers and companies dealing in components and parts, according to Counterpoint.

The country saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the current fiscal year (FY24), government and industry data showed.

As per the estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year, with Apple leading the market with more than 50 per cent in FY24.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Masimo issued 'significant win' in Apple Watch patent fight,https://in.investing.com/news/masimo-issued-significant-win-in-apple-watch-patent-fight-432SI-3870829,"Shares of Masimo Corp. (NASDAQ: ) gained over 9.5% in early trading Friday after announcing the U.S. International Trade Commission found that tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo's patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its Apple Watches. The commission has recommended a limited exclusion order for the infringing Apple Watches. The determination will now proceed to a 60-day presidential review phase, where the Biden administration will assess it.

“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,” added Mr. Kiani.

Analysts from BTIG called this a ""significant win"" for Masimo and put it in a more favorable position for a potential settlement with Apple.

""We think there remains upside potential for the stock for settlements, royalty payments, or other monetary-based agreements,"" the analysts added as they reiterated a Buy rating and $150 price target.

The analysts added that for next steps in the decision, they expect that the Biden administration takes no action to prevent the exclusion order issued by the commission from going into effect. Meanwhile, Apple can appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit. Appeals can take anywhere from 15-18 months, but the exclusion order would be in effect during this period.

From there, the analysts see five potential outcomes if President Biden takes no action. ""1) Apple does nothing and the exclusion order goes into effect. 2) The two parties reach a settlement. 3) Apple de-features the watch by removing or disabling the pulse-ox feature. 4) Apple has a design around (unclear to us if they have one). 5) We see the two parties enter into a partnership.""

If Masimo is ultimately successful, analysts from Needham & Company think Apple might be forced to pay it royalties. They estimate that the royalties could be $1-2 per Apple Watch which would total $50-100 million of annual revenue or $0.65-1.30 of EPS based on annual sales of 50 million Apple Watch units."

Tesla shares are trading in a continued downtrend in recent weeks after the company reported weaker-than-expected deliveries and results for the third quarter.

Tesla stock is down nearly 20% in October, although it is unclear when the analysts opened their shorts. On Thursday, the stock hit its lowest levels in five months.

Apple has also been moving lower, although not in as strong a downtrend as Tesla.

Elsewhere, the analysts said their fund owns Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) for AI exposure, while their Amazon (NASDAQ: ) position is still open due to “surging profits.”

They sold Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and have no position in Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), although they are looking for an opportunity to buy this internet stock.

“Our risk management principle is to sell when wrong on fundamentals, especially if we had a consensus view. Sold half AMC & rest today. Valuation is reasonable & Olympics/elections should help ad rev in 2024 but out for now,” the analysts said on Google."

The USITC found that Apple (AAPL) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo’s patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its products. The exclusion is scheduled to go into effect after a 60-day Presidential review period.

“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,” added Mr. Kiani.

Comments from two dozen academic institutions, leading antitrust and intellectual property scholars, physicians, investors, nonprofits, and members of Congress were filed in support of the public’s interest in the exclusion order. These comments conveyed a similar message: to protect innovation, such as Masimo’s technology, and to protect public health, it is necessary to preserve incentives to innovate and protect intellectual property and fair competition.

In its comment submitted to the ITC, the Consumer Federation of America stated, “There is no greater offense to both the antitrust and intellectual property law than when a dominant firm infringes the patent of a smaller rival, who is an actual or potential competitor. In this case, as in the other cases involving Apple’s egregious abuse of market power, the harms far outweigh the benefit. In fact, because competition will swiftly replace any services or products that Apple is no longer able to deliver because of the remedy, there will be little harm and a great deal of benefit for consumers and the economy.”"

This was announced at the 2022 Snapdragon Technology Summit held in Hawaii. The chip is designed to surpass competitors such as Apple’s M-series, Intel (NASDAQ: ) Core, and AMD (NASDAQ: ) Ryzen in performance and energy efficiency.

The Snapdragon X Elite boasts a 12-core Qualcomm Oryon CPU and an integrated Qualcomm Adreno GPU for PCs. This chip marks a significant advancement in technology and is expected to be integrated into ultra-thin laptops by nine leading PC manufacturers including Acer, Asus, Dell (NYSE: ), HP (NYSE: ), Honor, Lenovo under Yang Yuanqing's leadership, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Surface, Samsung (KS: ), and Xiaomi (OTC: ).

Lenovo plans to use the Snapdragon X Elite in its high-end laptops, leveraging on-device generative AI capabilities provided by the chip. This move is part of a broader trend toward the integration of AI into devices for enhanced performance and user experience.

Qualcomm has also addressed software compatibility issues through strategic partnerships with firms such as BlackMagic Design. The collaboration has resulted in ARM-adapted versions of software like Davinci Resolve. Performance tests reveal that Davinci Resolve runs 1.7x faster on the X Elite compared to standard 12-core CPUs with an integrated GPU. The speed can go up to 3x faster when leveraging the X Elite's Neural Processing Unit (NPU).

The Snapdragon X Elite is expected to play a significant role in the Windows 11 AI ecosystem. It has been customized through collaborations with multiple companies to meet various software and hardware requirements. In particular, BlackMagic Design's Davinci Resolve's Magic Mask for ARM-based Windows devices in 2024 is expected to perform faster on the Snapdragon X Elite than on a premium 12-core processor.

These developments underline Qualcomm's commitment to leading the market in chip technology and its strategy of leveraging partnerships to enhance software compatibility and performance. The anticipated launch of the Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 is expected to further strengthen Qualcomm's position in the market.

The company's stock has increased 8.67% in this period, maintaining a position above the 50-day moving average line. This trend has led to Arista leading in the computer networking sub-industry, with an inflow of $9.95 billion from 706 institutional investors.

With a market capitalization of $59.10 billion, Arista forms part of the and has surpassed other S&P technology stocks on both a three-month and year-to-date basis. The company's stock has seen a significant year-to-date increase of 53.70%.

Arista specializes in high-performance cloud networking solutions, integrating AI-driven technologies into its offerings for automation and optimization tasks. This approach seems to be paying off as the company has exhibited earnings growth between 21% to 72% over the past eight quarters and revenue growth between 24% to 57%. Notably, Arista's three-year revenue growth rate stands at 35%, while its three-year earnings growth rate is at 39%.

Earlier this year, as part of its strategic initiatives, Arista launched an AI-driven network identity service targeting enterprise security and IT operations, with a particular focus on the healthcare industry. This move aligns with their financial performance and appears to be contributing to their growth.

AI technology, similar to that used by Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), is a key driver behind Arista's performance. Despite this impressive performance, investors are advised to wait until after the company's earnings report on October 30 before purchasing shares. Analysts project earnings of $1.58 per share on revenue of $1.48 billion — year-over-year increases — but a whisper number of $1.64 per share suggests a potential for higher earnings.

""All this, coupled with a tough macro is prompting us to be slightly below our previous estimates, which were already slightly below consensus.

The tech giant intends to replace these with two versions of the fourth-generation AirPods that will incorporate design elements from both the third-gen AirPods and the advanced AirPods Pro.

The upcoming models are expected to maintain similar pricing to current models while introducing unique features. The premium version will boast active noise cancellation and enhanced Find My support akin to the AirPods Pro, but it may not include customizable ear tips, potentially impacting sound quality and noise cancellation.

Both new versions of the AirPods 4 will integrate a USB Type-C port, mirroring the trend set by recent iPhone models. This move comes in line with Apple's strategy to simplify its product range.

Furthermore, updates for the AirPods Max are also on the horizon, including the addition of a USB-C port and an array of fresh color options.

2022-10-26, IANS,Big Tech coalition seeks 12-18 month extension to comply with India's DPDP Act,https://in.investing.com/news/big-tech-coalition-seeks-1218-month-extension-to-comply-with-indias-dpdp-act-3867975,"New Delhi, Oct 26 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), an industry group representing Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), on Thursday urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to extend the deadline by 12-18 months to comply with certain provisions under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2022.In a letter addressed to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the group said that since implementing these provisions would require structural changes in organisations and businesses, “they are likely to face significant amount of challenges during the course of such transition”.

“This exercise will be fairly new to domestic and international business entities alike, since compliance with data laws of other jurisdictions like GDPR do not have such provisions. Hence, businesses would require fundamental changes in the technology architecture of their platform,” the coalition wrote in the letter.

The government had said last month that some entities (like startups and MSMEs and establishments like hospitals that handle people's data) may be given a year’s time to fine-tune their systems to comply with the DPDP Act, 2022, as the government officials work with industry stakeholders to formulate detailed rules.

According to the AIC letter, businesses would be required to conduct time-intensive data mapping exercises across all the datasets of the Data Principals in order to comply with Section 5 notice requirements for existing data sets.

“Consent notices would be required to be stored in an accessible manner for Data Fiduciaries to modify or erase Data Principal’s personal data. This would require significant software and hardware upgrade in the infrastructure of the country which is time and financial resource consuming,” the letter read.

Some sections of the DPDP Act introduce a novel concept of the Consent Managers.

“This is not a tested model under Indian law. The Consent Manager framework would have to be developed, tested and finally deployed in the ecosystem. It would also be required to integrate the Consent Manager framework with the Data Fiduciary’s consent architecture,” the AIC letter further argued.

The DPDP Act provides certain additional rights to the Data Principals such as the right to correct, delete, update and erase data under Section 12.

Section 14 of the DPDP Act provides a right to nominate another individual in case of death or incapacity of the Data Principal.

According to the letter, Data Fiduciaries will be required to implement tools that allow Data Principals to enjoy their rights on a real time basis.

“Many businesses may not have the ability to build internal tools and may need to rely on third parties to develop such processes. Such activities are likely to take significant time,” it said.

The AIC requested MeitY “to coordinate harmonization of all the above timelines to provide seamless transition experience to Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors alike”.

“We request that unsynchronised implementation or duplication of efforts be avoided while providing different timelines for different entities with necessary provisions for uninterrupted transition,” the letter read.

From hefty penalties ranging from a minimum of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on social media platforms for violating rules to enabling digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data, the data protection bill envisages the creation of a Data Protection Board of India.

The Bill will apply to the processing of digital personal data within India where such data is collected online, or collected offline and is digitised.

It will also apply to such processing outside the country, if it is for offering goods or services in India.

They can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly perform many of the most common actions.

“This new feature complements existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise to wake, and cover to mute that make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use,” Apple said in a statement late on Wednesday.

The double tap gesture is helpful in common situations when the user’s other hand is occupied, such as when walking the dog, cooking, or holding a cup of coffee.

You can also pause, resume, and end a timer, stop and resume a stopwatch and snoozing an alarm, along with playing and pausing music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

The double tap gesture is powered by the S9 SiP, which is 25 per cent more power efficient than the previous generation, and the new 4-core Neural Engine, which can perform machine learning tasks twice as fast.

The double tap gesture works anytime the display is awake, and the feature is available all day long with minimal impact to the 18-hour battery life on Apple Watch Series 9 or the 36-hour battery life on Apple Watch Ultra 2, said Apple.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Apple Gears Up For Significant AirPods Overhaul In 2024 and 2025,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-gears-up-for-significant-airpods-overhaul-in-2024-and-2025-93CH-3867103,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is planning a major revamp of its popular AirPods lineup, with redesigned versions of the entry-level AirPods and the AirPods Max slated for release in 2024, followed by an updated Pro model in 2025. The changes are aimed at enhancing earbud design, case aesthetics, and audio quality.

The AirPods, first launched in 2016 after Apple eliminated traditional headphone jacks from its devices, quickly overcame initial consumer skepticism to dominate the wireless earbuds market. According to Canalys, the AirPods accounted for approximately 32% of sales last year.

The current second- and third-generation AirPods will be retired next year, making way for two fourth-generation models with distinct features at similar price points. These new models will feature a design blend of third-generation AirPods and the Pro model, complete with short stems. The premium model will include noise cancellation and an updated charging case equipped with speakers for Find My alerts. Both new low-end models will offer improved fit but won't likely include replaceable tips like the AirPods Pro. The fourth-generation AirPods will adopt USB-C charging, continuing a shift initiated by the AirPods Pro.

In addition to these changes, Apple is also planning an update to the high-end over-ear AirPods Max. The new version will switch to a USB-C charging port and introduce new color options.

Looking further ahead to 2025, Apple is preparing a redesign and chip upgrade for the AirPods Pro. The company is also developing health features tied to hearing for this device.

Despite the success of the AirPods lineup, which generates approximately $40 billion annually as part of Apple's Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, Apple faces stiff competition from rivals such as Samsung Electronics (KS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Xiaomi (OTC: ), Sony (NYSE: ), Bose, and Jabra. This rapidly evolving market underscores the need for continuous innovation.

However, the third-generation AirPods have underperformed due to their lack of substantial improvements over previous models. The current lineup includes the second-generation AirPods ($129), third-generation AirPods ($169), and the AirPods Pro ($249). The over-ear AirPods Max headphones are priced at $550.

Deutsche Bank's stock surged by 7.1% following promises of more share buybacks and potentially larger investor capital returns next year. Thermo Fisher (NYSE: )'s shares fell by 0.8% after it cut its annual profit forecast due to weak demand for services used to make therapies and vaccines, coupled with rising raw material costs.

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) saw a 1.4% stock rise after raising its annual free cash flow forecast following surpassing quarterly subscriber additions and earnings estimates.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Masimo issued 'significant win' in Apple Watch patent fight,https://in.investing.com/news/masimo-issued-significant-win-in-apple-watch-patent-fight-432SI-3870829,"Shares of Masimo Corp. (NASDAQ: ) gained over 9.5% in early trading Friday after announcing the U.S. International Trade Commission found that tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo's patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its Apple Watches. The commission has recommended a limited exclusion order for the infringing Apple Watches. The determination will now proceed to a 60-day presidential review phase, where the Biden administration will assess it.

“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,” added Mr. Kiani.

Analysts from BTIG called this a ""significant win"" for Masimo and put it in a more favorable position for a potential settlement with Apple.

""We think there remains upside potential for the stock for settlements, royalty payments, or other monetary-based agreements,"" the analysts added as they reiterated a Buy rating and $150 price target.

The analysts added that for next steps in the decision, they expect that the Biden administration takes no action to prevent the exclusion order issued by the commission from going into effect. Meanwhile, Apple can appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit. Appeals can take anywhere from 15-18 months, but the exclusion order would be in effect during this period.

From there, the analysts see five potential outcomes if President Biden takes no action. ""1) Apple does nothing and the exclusion order goes into effect. 2) The two parties reach a settlement. 3) Apple de-features the watch by removing or disabling the pulse-ox feature. 4) Apple has a design around (unclear to us if they have one). 5) We see the two parties enter into a partnership.""

If Masimo is ultimately successful, analysts from Needham & Company think Apple might be forced to pay it royalties. They estimate that the royalties could be $1-2 per Apple Watch which would total $50-100 million of annual revenue or $0.65-1.30 of EPS based on annual sales of 50 million Apple Watch units."

Tesla stock is down nearly 20% in October, although it is unclear when the analysts opened their shorts. On Thursday, the stock hit its lowest levels in five months.

Apple has also been moving lower, although not in as strong a downtrend as Tesla.

The USITC found that Apple (AAPL) violated U.S. laws by incorporating Masimo’s patented light-based pulse oximetry technology in its products. The exclusion is scheduled to go into effect after a 60-day Presidential review period.

“Today’s ruling by the USITC sends a powerful message that even the world’s largest company is not above the law,” said Joe Kiani, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Masimo. “This important determination is a strong validation of our efforts to hold Apple accountable for unlawfully misappropriating our patented technology,” added Mr. Kiani.

Comments from two dozen academic institutions, leading antitrust and intellectual property scholars, physicians, investors, nonprofits, and members of Congress were filed in support of the public’s interest in the exclusion order. These comments conveyed a similar message: to protect innovation, such as Masimo’s technology, and to protect public health, it is necessary to preserve incentives to innovate and protect intellectual property and fair competition.

In its comment submitted to the ITC, the Consumer Federation of America stated, “There is no greater offense to both the antitrust and intellectual property law than when a dominant firm infringes the patent of a smaller rival, who is an actual or potential competitor. In this case, as in the other cases involving Apple’s egregious abuse of market power, the harms far outweigh the benefit. In fact, because competition will swiftly replace any services or products that Apple is no longer able to deliver because of the remedy, there will be little harm and a great deal of benefit for consumers and the economy.”"

This was announced at the 2022 Snapdragon Technology Summit held in Hawaii. The chip is designed to surpass competitors such as Apple’s M-series, Intel (NASDAQ: ) Core, and AMD (NASDAQ: ) Ryzen in performance and energy efficiency.

The Snapdragon X Elite boasts a 12-core Qualcomm Oryon CPU and an integrated Qualcomm Adreno GPU for PCs. This chip marks a significant advancement in technology and is expected to be integrated into ultra-thin laptops by nine leading PC manufacturers including Acer, Asus, Dell (NYSE: ), HP (NYSE: ), Honor, Lenovo under Yang Yuanqing's leadership, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Surface, Samsung (KS: ), and Xiaomi (OTC: ).

Lenovo plans to use the Snapdragon X Elite in its high-end laptops, leveraging on-device generative AI capabilities provided by the chip. This move is part of a broader trend toward the integration of AI into devices for enhanced performance and user experience.

Qualcomm has also addressed software compatibility issues through strategic partnerships with firms such as BlackMagic Design. The collaboration has resulted in ARM-adapted versions of software like Davinci Resolve. Performance tests reveal that Davinci Resolve runs 1.7x faster on the X Elite compared to standard 12-core CPUs with an integrated GPU. The speed can go up to 3x faster when leveraging the X Elite's Neural Processing Unit (NPU).

The Snapdragon X Elite is expected to play a significant role in the Windows 11 AI ecosystem. It has been customized through collaborations with multiple companies to meet various software and hardware requirements. In particular, BlackMagic Design's Davinci Resolve's Magic Mask for ARM-based Windows devices in 2024 is expected to perform faster on the Snapdragon X Elite than on a premium 12-core processor.

These developments underline Qualcomm's commitment to leading the market in chip technology and its strategy of leveraging partnerships to enhance software compatibility and performance. The anticipated launch of the Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 is expected to further strengthen Qualcomm's position in the market.

2022-10-26, Investing.com,Arista Networks Outpaces Nvidia And Apple In Three-Month Performance,https://in.investing.com/news/arista-networks-outpaces-nvidia-and-apple-in-threemonth-performance-93CH-3869316,"Cloud networking software maker, Arista Networks (NYSE: ), has been on an impressive run, outperforming tech giants Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) over the past three months. The company's stock has increased 8.67% in this period, maintaining a position above the 50-day moving average line. This trend has led to Arista leading in the computer networking sub-industry, with an inflow of $9.95 billion from 706 institutional investors.

With a market capitalization of $59.10 billion, Arista forms part of the and has surpassed other S&P technology stocks on both a three-month and year-to-date basis. The company's stock has seen a significant year-to-date increase of 53.70%.

Arista specializes in high-performance cloud networking solutions, integrating AI-driven technologies into its offerings for automation and optimization tasks. This approach seems to be paying off as the company has exhibited earnings growth between 21% to 72% over the past eight quarters and revenue growth between 24% to 57%. Notably, Arista's three-year revenue growth rate stands at 35%, while its three-year earnings growth rate is at 39%.

Earlier this year, as part of its strategic initiatives, Arista launched an AI-driven network identity service targeting enterprise security and IT operations, with a particular focus on the healthcare industry. This move aligns with their financial performance and appears to be contributing to their growth.

AI technology, similar to that used by Nvidia, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), is a key driver behind Arista's performance. Despite this impressive performance, investors are advised to wait until after the company's earnings report on October 30 before purchasing shares. Analysts project earnings of $1.58 per share on revenue of $1.48 billion — year-over-year increases — but a whisper number of $1.64 per share suggests a potential for higher earnings.

The analysts, who reiterated an Overweight rating and $220 price target on Apple shares, said one of the reasons for the cut is that iPhone checks indicate demand is skewed towards Pro models.

""The primary reasons for our cut are a tough global phone environment, initial weakness for iPhones in China, and slightly tough compares for Mac and iPad,"" the analysts wrote.

""All this, coupled with a tough macro is prompting us to be slightly below our previous estimates, which were already slightly below consensus. At this time, we are ~$2.7B below the street for December 2022 quarter expectations, with the largest factor being tough China comps given local competition and a lackluster economy,"" they explained.

The analysts added that Mac and iPad should also put pressure on street numbers. Overall, Piper Sandler believes that India will provide some recourse versus declining China sales, but they don't see it being enough to offset global and China weakness. ""We see India gaining 3-4% while China declines 5-6%,"" the analysts said."

The tech giant intends to replace these with two versions of the fourth-generation AirPods that will incorporate design elements from both the third-gen AirPods and the advanced AirPods Pro.

The upcoming models are expected to maintain similar pricing to current models while introducing unique features. The premium version will boast active noise cancellation and enhanced Find My support akin to the AirPods Pro, but it may not include customizable ear tips, potentially impacting sound quality and noise cancellation.

Both new versions of the AirPods 4 will integrate a USB Type-C port, mirroring the trend set by recent iPhone models. This move comes in line with Apple's strategy to simplify its product range.

Furthermore, updates for the AirPods Max are also on the horizon, including the addition of a USB-C port and an array of fresh color options. Apple's 2024 roadmap also reveals plans for an upgraded version of the AirPods Pro in 2025, featuring a faster chip, a redesigned aesthetic, and innovative ear-health features.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's recently launched AirPods Pro 2, which comes equipped with a new USB-C port, is just a precursor to more significant changes in the AirPods lineup. The advanced version of the upcoming AirPods 4 will also feature an innovative charging case with speakers for Find My alerts.

These strategic decisions reflect Apple's ongoing efforts to evolve its product offerings while maintaining its commitment to design aesthetics and technological innovation.

2022-10-26, IANS,Big Tech coalition seeks 12-18 month extension to comply with India's DPDP Act,https://in.investing.com/news/big-tech-coalition-seeks-1218-month-extension-to-comply-with-indias-dpdp-act-3867975,"New Delhi, Oct 26 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), an industry group representing Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), on Thursday urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to extend the deadline by 12-18 months to comply with certain provisions under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2022.In a letter addressed to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the group said that since implementing these provisions would require structural changes in organisations and businesses, “they are likely to face significant amount of challenges during the course of such transition”.

“This exercise will be fairly new to domestic and international business entities alike, since compliance with data laws of other jurisdictions like GDPR do not have such provisions. Hence, businesses would require fundamental changes in the technology architecture of their platform,” the coalition wrote in the letter.

The government had said last month that some entities (like startups and MSMEs and establishments like hospitals that handle people's data) may be given a year’s time to fine-tune their systems to comply with the DPDP Act, 2022, as the government officials work with industry stakeholders to formulate detailed rules.

According to the AIC letter, businesses would be required to conduct time-intensive data mapping exercises across all the datasets of the Data Principals in order to comply with Section 5 notice requirements for existing data sets.

“Consent notices would be required to be stored in an accessible manner for Data Fiduciaries to modify or erase Data Principal’s personal data. This would require significant software and hardware upgrade in the infrastructure of the country which is time and financial resource consuming,” the letter read.

Some sections of the DPDP Act introduce a novel concept of the Consent Managers.

“This is not a tested model under Indian law. The Consent Manager framework would have to be developed, tested and finally deployed in the ecosystem. It would also be required to integrate the Consent Manager framework with the Data Fiduciary’s consent architecture,” the AIC letter further argued.

The DPDP Act provides certain additional rights to the Data Principals such as the right to correct, delete, update and erase data under Section 12.

Section 14 of the DPDP Act provides a right to nominate another individual in case of death or incapacity of the Data Principal.

According to the letter, Data Fiduciaries will be required to implement tools that allow Data Principals to enjoy their rights on a real time basis.

“Many businesses may not have the ability to build internal tools and may need to rely on third parties to develop such processes. Such activities are likely to take significant time,” it said.

The AIC requested MeitY “to coordinate harmonization of all the above timelines to provide seamless transition experience to Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors alike”.

“We request that unsynchronised implementation or duplication of efforts be avoided while providing different timelines for different entities with necessary provisions for uninterrupted transition,” the letter read.

From hefty penalties ranging from a minimum of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on social media platforms for violating rules to enabling digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data, the data protection bill envisages the creation of a Data Protection Board of India.

The Bill will apply to the processing of digital personal data within India where such data is collected online, or collected offline and is digitised.

It will also apply to such processing outside the country, if it is for offering goods or services in India.

They can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly perform many of the most common actions.

“This new feature complements existing gestures like tap, swipe, raise to wake, and cover to mute that make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use,” Apple said in a statement late on Wednesday.

The double tap gesture is helpful in common situations when the user’s other hand is occupied, such as when walking the dog, cooking, or holding a cup of coffee.

You can also pause, resume, and end a timer, stop and resume a stopwatch and snoozing an alarm, along with playing and pausing music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

The double tap gesture is powered by the S9 SiP, which is 25 per cent more power efficient than the previous generation, and the new 4-core Neural Engine, which can perform machine learning tasks twice as fast.

The double tap gesture works anytime the display is awake, and the feature is available all day long with minimal impact to the 18-hour battery life on Apple Watch Series 9 or the 36-hour battery life on Apple Watch Ultra 2, said Apple.

watchOS 10.1 is available for Apple Watch Series 4 and later, and requires iPhone XS or later running iOS 17.

The changes are aimed at enhancing earbud design, case aesthetics, and audio quality.

The AirPods, first launched in 2016 after Apple eliminated traditional headphone jacks from its devices, quickly overcame initial consumer skepticism to dominate the wireless earbuds market. According to Canalys, the AirPods accounted for approximately 32% of sales last year.

The current second- and third-generation AirPods will be retired next year, making way for two fourth-generation models with distinct features at similar price points. These new models will feature a design blend of third-generation AirPods and the Pro model, complete with short stems. The premium model will include noise cancellation and an updated charging case equipped with speakers for Find My alerts. Both new low-end models will offer improved fit but won't likely include replaceable tips like the AirPods Pro. The fourth-generation AirPods will adopt USB-C charging, continuing a shift initiated by the AirPods Pro.

In addition to these changes, Apple is also planning an update to the high-end over-ear AirPods Max. The new version will switch to a USB-C charging port and introduce new color options.

Looking further ahead to 2025, Apple is preparing a redesign and chip upgrade for the AirPods Pro. The company is also developing health features tied to hearing for this device.

Despite the success of the AirPods lineup, which generates approximately $40 billion annually as part of Apple's Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, Apple faces stiff competition from rivals such as Samsung Electronics (KS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Xiaomi (OTC: ), Sony (NYSE: ), Bose, and Jabra. This rapidly evolving market underscores the need for continuous innovation.

However, the third-generation AirPods have underperformed due to their lack of substantial improvements over previous models. The current lineup includes the second-generation AirPods ($129), third-generation AirPods ($169), and the AirPods Pro ($249). The over-ear AirPods Max headphones are priced at $550.

The M3 chip, developed using TSMC's 3nm process and incorporating hardware-accelerated ray tracing, is expected to enhance devices like MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and iMac.

The M3 Macs unveiling, referred to as Apple’s ""Scary Fast"" Halloween event, is anticipated to overshadow Qualcomm’s summit in Hawaii this week. The new chip is predicted to provide Apple with another 12 to 18 months of superiority in offering systems that can run Windows, Linux, or Mac. The company's control over hardware design, processor design, and OS gives it a unique advantage over competitors. This edge allows Apple to optimize real-world performance despite competitive processor benchmark figures.

Among the products expected to be spotlighted at the event are new 14-in. and 16-in. MacBook Pros equipped with M3 chips. There are also speculations about an upgrade to the iMac/iMac Pro and the introduction of Vision Pro. The M3 chips are expected to offer up to 12 to 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, and 36GB to 48GB of RAM.

Comparatively, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite, a PC-class processor featuring 12 custom Oryon CPU cores, promises a 50% faster multi-threaded CPU performance than M2 but falls short of outperforming the M2 Max in single-threaded tasks. The Snapdragon X Elite also delivers multiple days of battery life for laptops and supports on-device generative AI processing.

If the M3 doesn't make an appearance at the event, Apple might present an M2 iMac and a potential M2-powered iPad Air as part of its product lineup. The event will be followed by Apple’s fourth-quarter financial announcement on November 2.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Google prepares defense in ongoing antitrust trial,https://in.investing.com/news/google-prepares-defense-in-ongoing-antitrust-trial-93CH-3865703,"In the ongoing antitrust trial, U.S. et al. v. Google (NASDAQ: ), the Department of Justice and state attorneys general are arguing that Google has employed illegal tactics to maintain its search and search ads monopolies, which they claim have resulted in harm to consumers and advertisers. As part of their case, the prosecution asserts that Google sustains its monopoly by paying over $10 billion annually to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms to secure default search engine status, hindering competition from other search engines like Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing and DuckDuckGo.

Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, argues that Google's significant scale creates a feedback loop that distorts the competitive landscape. The government’s case also emphasizes the negative impact of Google’s dominance on consumers and advertisers. They claim that Google's control over search delivers a lower-quality product and restricts consumer choice, particularly concerning privacy-respecting services.

Furthermore, the government alleges that Google's dominance in search has allowed it to control the online ad market, leading to inflated ad prices. Witnesses have included executives from Microsoft, Bing, major advertisers like Home Depot (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), DuckDuckGo, and former Google employees such as Sridhar Ramaswamy.

Joshua Lowcock, an executive from an ad buying firm, testified about Google's share of search and its appeal to his firm’s clients. Arjan Dijk, a former Google executive now at Booking (NASDAQ: ).com, discussed Google’s dominant pool of potential customers. Evidence presented includes an email from Jerry Dischler, a Google executive discussing potential strategies to increase ad revenue and testimony from Jeff Hurst, the former COO of Expedia (NASDAQ: ), about Vrbo's experience with Google's inflated ad prices.

Presiding Judge Amit P. Mehta heard testimony from Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, about his company's struggles due to Google’s control over default search engines. Today, Google is preparing for its defense, maintaining that users can easily switch default search engines and that it continuously improves its search engine for the benefit of consumers.

This marked the second consecutive day of gains for the tech giant, reflecting an overall positive trend in the market as both NASDAQ and indices also appreciated by 0.93% and 0.62% respectively.

Despite the favorable market environment, Apple's performance was comparatively subdued. The company's stock price growth was outpaced by competitors Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. Cl C, and Alphabet Inc. Cl A GOOGL, which all reported larger increases in their stock prices.

While Apple's shares are on an upward trajectory, they still remain $24.79 below their 52-week high recorded on July 19th. The company's trading volume of 43.5 million continues to lag behind its 50-day average, indicating a potential area of concern for investors monitoring the tech giant's performance in the stock market.

The recent developments come amid a broader context of market fluctuations and competitive dynamics within the tech industry. With Apple's stock price still trailing its yearly peak and its trading volume remaining below average, future sessions will be closely watched for signs of change in these trends.

2022-10-24, Investing.com,Qualcomm introduces AI-enhanced chip for 2024 to revolutionize the PC,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-introduces-aienhanced-chip-for-2024-to-revolutionize-the-pc-432SI-3864928,"At the Snapdragon Summit today, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) introduced its latest and most powerful PC processor, the Snapdragon X Elite. This new chip, designed for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Windows-based laptops, is claimed to surpass Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Mac chips in certain tasks.

Anticipated for release in laptops next year, the X Elite focuses on enhanced AI functionalities such as summarizing emails, writing text, and generating images.

This announcement follows reports of Microsoft urging Qualcomm and other tech giants to produce chips for AI-enhanced Windows features.

Qualcomm aims to challenge Apple, which has seen a significant market share increase in laptop and desktop computers since launching its custom-designed chips in 2020.

Qualcomm asserts the X Elite outperforms Apple's M2 Max chip in speed at some tasks and both Apple and Intel (NASDAQ: ) PC chips in energy efficiency. However, its standout feature, according to Qualcomm Senior VP, is the capability to process AI models with 13 billion parameters, making it exceptionally advanced for AI text or image generation tasks. The Senior VP emphasized the unparalleled speed of these models, stating, ""No one else in the world can do that"" on a laptop."
2022-10-24, Investing.com,Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon X Elite to challenge Intel and Apple,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x-elite-to-challenge-intel-and-apple-93CH-3864785,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) has announced the launch of its new Snapdragon X Elite chip, a product of their refined SoC and processor development strategy. The high-performance chip is set to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: )'s M2 chip in Windows laptops and is expected to debut in mid-2024.

The Snapdragon X Elite, constructed on a 4nm process, employs an Oryon three-cluster CPU configuration with twelve 3.8GHZ cores that can boost to 4.3GHz for two cores during AI generation or other intensive tasks. The chip supports the LPDDR5x memory standard, currently the fastest for PCs, and accommodates up to 64GB of LPDDR5x-8533 memory.

The new chip also features Adreno integrated graphics offering up to 4.6 TFLOPS of GPU performance and DirectX 12 support. It showcases superior display capabilities, handling larger workspaces with two 5K external displays, three external UHD displays, or onboard displays at 4K with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, the real-life performance of these features is yet to be determined.

In terms of connectivity, the Snapdragon X Elite supports WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB4, and multiple cameras via a dual 18-bit Qualcomm Spectra image signal processor. Device makers have the option to opt for the Snapdragon X65 modem for 4G/5G connectivity.

The Hexagon NPU, rated for 45 TOPs, underscores Qualcomm's commitment to AI. Qualcomm claims an impressive 100x increase in operations per second over unnamed leading competitors and efficient artificial operations processing with this new chip. High-end Qualcomm sound processing equips the X Elite with lossless audio.

The company touts the Snapdragon X Elite as a robust processor that offers double the CPU performance at the same power usage as Intel’s 12-core i7 and requires 65% less power for similar performance to a 14-core i7. Despite its AI focus, the SoC maintains efficient cooling and battery life.

However, it's worth noting that a fast processor alone doesn't ensure a good Windows PC user experience; software compatibility is crucial. Qualcomm's chips have previously struggled with slower speeds than Apple's chips and inefficient x86 Windows apps on Qualcomm-equipped PCs. Consequently, the potential of the Snapdragon X Elite in making PCs competitive with those featuring Intel (NASDAQ: ) or AMD chips remains to be seen.

The Snapdragon X Elite is set to compete with next-gen chips like Intel’s Meteor Lake and AMD’s Ryzen 8000 upon its release. With its advanced features and potential, the chip represents Qualcomm's efforts to stake its claim in the high-performance chip market.

2022-10-24, Investing.com,Apple needs to invest heavily in generative AI to catch up,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-needs-to-invest-heavily-in-generative-ai-to-catch-up-432SI-3864707,"Analysts at TF International Securities said in a post that they believe Apple (NASDAQ: ) will need to invest several billion dollars annually to catch up with the competition in generative AI.

The analysts explained that their latest survey indicates Apple plans to purchase 2,000 to 3,000 and 18,000 to 20,000 units of AI servers in 2022 and 2024, respectively, representing ""about 1.3% and 5% of worldwide AI server shipments in 2022 and 2024, respectively.""

""We think it’s reasonable to assume that the AI servers Apple purchases are primarily this year’s most popular specification: Nvidia’s HGX H100 8-GPU, designed for generative AI training and inference,"" the analysts said. ""It’s also expected that some shipments in 4Q24 will likely upgrade to the B100 solution.""

They estimate that Apple will spend at least about $620 million in 2022 and $4.75 billion in 2024, although they note that the AI server purchases are significantly lower in 2022 than in 2024 due to a shortage of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) AI chips starting from 2Q23.

Even if the supply of Nvidia AI chips improves in 2024, Apple’s AI server purchases still lag behind its competitors, the analysts said.

""It’s reasonable to estimate that Apple would have to invest at least several billion US dollars annually to have a chance of catching up with its competitors,"" they added.

""If Apple really intends to spend only a billion dollars a year on generative AI development, it won’t matter much if our survey is wrong, but we are genuinely concerned about the future of Apple’s generative AI business/service."""

“You’re invited to watch a special Apple Event online. Tune in at apple.com,"" the company said in an invite.

Apple may be planning to announce a refreshed 24-inch iMac at the event, along with a new MacBook Pro, according to reports.

Previous rumours indicated the new computers could include Apple’s new M3 chip for even faster performance.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the tech giant may end “an over 900-day drought since the M1 iMac launched in the first half of 2021”.

He was ""told that Apple is planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month"".

According to the report, several configurations of the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and other higher-end Pro models won't ship until November.

The tech giant organised its “Wonderlust” event in September, where it revealed the new iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, and AirPods Pro with USB-C charging.

Meanwhile, Apple has brought more choice to iPad users with a new and affordable Apple Pencil that offers pixel-perfect accuracy, low latency and tilt sensitivity.

The new Apple Pencil will be available for Rs 7,900 (Rs 6,900 for education) beginning in early November.

The companies have added nearly $4tn to their market capitalization in 2022 alone, overshadowing the $3.4tn increase for the entire MSCI index. This significant influence has even affected markets abroad, with the facing a potential decline without their contributions.

Today, US companies account for 61% of the $60tn MSCI index, a considerable rise from less than 50% a decade ago. The ten largest stocks now constitute almost 19% of the index, a substantial increase from 8% in 2013.

However, global stocks have experienced instability over recent months due to concerns about interest rates and geopolitical risks such as the Israel-Hamas conflict. US stocks currently trade at about 18 times their expected earnings over the next year, compared to 12 times for the MSCI all-country excluding US stocks.

In this climate, Max Gokhman from Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and Jurrien Timmer from Fidelity have both suggested that non-US stocks being cheaper does not necessarily mean they will outperform. They caution that the ""magnificent seven"" could face pressure if they fail to demonstrate tangible benefits from AI growth next year. However, they also suggest that growth stocks could see benefits when interest rates start to decline.

In related news, OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, is currently discussing a share sale with investors that would value it at about $86bn, tripling its value since April.

The ongoing dominance of US firms in global markets has sparked concerns about a potential US monopoly. This could potentially drain liquidity from other markets and incentivize companies to relocate their listings for higher valuations and trading volumes in the US.

Despite Tesla's disappointing results causing a 10% stock drop, the remaining six tech giants show promise despite macroeconomic concerns like rising bond yields, inflation fears, and the Israel-Hamas war's oil price impact.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Nvidia to design Arm-based PC chips, posing fresh challenge to Intel",https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-to-design-armbased-pc-chips-posing-fresh-challenge-to-intel-432SI-3862943,"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), known for its dominance in AI computing chips, is now coming after Intel's (NASDAQ: ) personal computer domain. NVIDIA is in the early stages of crafting CPUs compatible with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) Windows, leveraging Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) technology, according to a Reuters report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

This aligns with Microsoft's strategy to support companies in producing Arm-based chips for Windows PCs, in part to compete with Apple's (NASDAQ: ) growing market share from its proprietary Arm-based Mac chips.

Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is exploring Arm technology for PCs, with both NVIDIA and AMD potentially releasing these chips by 2025. They'd be in the company of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), an Arm-based chip producer for laptops since 2016.

The efforts of NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) have the potential to disrupt the PC market, which has been long dominated by Intel, especially with growing challenges from Apple.

Apple's custom Mac chips, with their energy efficiency and speedy performance, are challenging Intel's PC industry lead. Recognizing Apple's success, Microsoft aims for comparable efficiency. Initially, Microsoft selected Qualcomm to develop Windows-compatible chips, offering an exclusivity deal until 2024. According to the sources, has encouraged others to enter the market once that exclusivity deal expires.

Microsoft is urging chip manufacturers to incorporate sophisticated AI functionalities into their CPUs. They foresee AI-driven software, like Copilot, becoming integral to the Windows experience. For this vision, upcoming chips from Nvidia, AMD, and others must allocate sufficient on-chip resources.

However, the success of Microsoft and these chip companies in this venture is uncertain. Developers have spent decades and invested massive funds in crafting Windows code for the x86 computing architecture, which is owned by Intel but also licensed to AMD. Codes tailored for x86 won't directly fit Arm-based configurations, making the shift potentially problematic.

Following the Reuters report, NVIDIA shares jumped more than 3% today, while Intel fell around 3%."
2022-10-23, Investing.com,Apple Intensifies AI Push With $1 Billion Investment,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-intensifies-ai-push-with-1-billion-investment-93CH-3862746,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly ramping up its efforts in generative artificial intelligence (AI), planning a $1 billion investment to integrate AI tools into Siri, Apple Music, and other applications. The tech giant's move is aimed at competing with Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard AI bot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to Bloomberg.

The company has posted several job openings focused on AI, indicating its intent to develop a generative AI-based developer experience platform for internal use and support the app development team. One particular opening in the Apple Retail department is geared towards developing a conversational AI platform for customer engagement.

Apple is also exploring ways to incorporate generative AI into development tools such as Xcode, presentation software Keynote, and apps like Pages for creating auto-generated playlists. These efforts are part of the company's larger initiative to infuse AI into its product suite and services.

In addition to these developments, Apple has built Ajax, a language model, and Apple GPT, a chatbot. These tools are awaiting integration into Siri, Messages, Xcode for aiding developers, and Apple Music for auto-playlists.

According to InvestingPro, Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is often seen as a sign of confidence in the company's future prospects. The tech giant also yields a high return on invested capital, and its strong earnings should allow the management to continue dividend payments. Moreover, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which is a testament to its financial stability and commitment to rewarding shareholders. InvestingPro Tips also suggest that Apple operates with a high return on assets, which is an indication of the company's efficiency in using its resources.

Even with these advancements, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google's Bard AI bot, Apple's public AI initiatives are still considered lagging. Its only notable AI achievement so far has been an enhanced auto-correct feature in iOS 17.

The market has reacted moderately optimistically to Apple's AI push. The firm's shares have surged by nearly 37% in 2022. Analysts have given Apple's stock 20 Buys and nine Holds, with an average price target of $207.51, suggesting a 20.2% upside potential. InvestingPro data shows that Apple's market cap is $2710.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 28.88 and a PEG ratio of -19.75, which investors may want to consider when evaluating the company's valuation.

When queried by Seeking Alpha about these developments, Apple chose not to comment. However, with a revenue of $383.93B USD and an operating income of $112.23B USD as per InvestingPro data, Apple's financial health appears to be strong, which could support its ambitious AI initiatives.

At 09:41 ET (13:41 GMT), the was down 200 points or 0.6%, while the was down 0.7% and the was down 0.9%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indexes on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based S&P dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Chevron set to buy Hess for $53 billion

Elsewhere, the oil market is once more the center of major M&A, as Chevron (NYSE: ) announced plans to buy smaller rival Hess (NYSE: ) in a $53-billion all-stock deal, implying a premium of about 4.9% to the share's last close. Chevron shares fell 2.7%, while Hess shares rose 0.6%.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower 1.5% after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion, which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,Apple Shares Trade At Fair Value Amidst Market Volatility,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-shares-trade-at-fair-value-amidst-market-volatility-93CH-3862220,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s shares, currently trading at $173, are considered fairly priced, according to a recent valuation model. This evaluation places the tech giant's stock at approximately 7.70% above its intrinsic value of $160.52, suggesting that investors are purchasing the shares at a reasonable rate. The InvestingPro data shows an adjusted market cap of $2700.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 28.99, which supports this valuation.

The company's stock has experienced significant price fluctuations recently, with highs reaching $196 and lows dipping to $170. These shifts have sparked questions about Apple's actual worth and whether it may be undervalued. The firm's high beta indicates a greater level of price volatility compared to the overall market. This volatility can present buying opportunities for investors during bearish periods. Notably, Apple's stock generally trades with low price volatility, as noted in the InvestingPro Tips.

Looking ahead, Apple's future seems promising with an anticipated 21% growth in earnings. This projection further bolsters the view that the company's shares are appropriately valued, despite the recent market turbulence. The InvestingPro Tips also highlight that Apple's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments and that the company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be appealing to income-focused investors.

Furthermore, Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is often a positive sign of the company's faith in its own future growth. The company also yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets - all these factors indicate a strong financial position and potential for future growth.

In addition to these insights, InvestingPro offers 17 more tips about Apple, which can be found at InvestingPro. These tips could provide valuable insights for potential investors and help them make more informed decisions.

The InvestingPro data also reveals a revenue LTM2022.Q3 of 383.93B USD and a gross profit LTM2022.Q3 of 166.82B USD. While the revenue growth LTM2022.Q3 shows a slight decline of -0.93%, the company's strong financials and promising future outlook offer a compelling case for investment.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,Apple stock falls as China woes continue,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-stock-falls-as-china-woes-continue-432SI-3862017,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares fell 1.5% in early Monday trade as investors were digesting updates from China.

Asian investor confidence was shaken as Beijing initiated several investigations into Foxconn (TW: ), a key Apple supplier.

According to local media reports, the tax inspections were conducted at Foxconn facilities in two Chinese provinces. Moreover, China's natural resources department conducted on-site investigations into land use by key Foxconn businesses in the provinces of Henan and Hubei.

Foxconn has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the investigation.

""Legal compliance everywhere we operate around the world is a fundamental principle of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn),"" the company said in a statement.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations.”

It could be that China is hitting back at the U.S. by targeting one of its biggest companies - Apple.

Elsewhere, Reuters reported that Chinese retailers are offering deep iPhone 15 discounts.

Chinese e-commerce platforms, including Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) and Taobao, are providing significant discounts on Apple's iPhone 15 series, selling some models for up to 900 yuan ($123) below the retail price.

Pinduoduo is reportedly selling the 128 GB version of the iPhone 15 Plus for 6,098 yuan, which is 900 yuan less than Apple's retail price of 6,999 yuan. Similarly, the 512 GB iPhone 15 Pro Max, priced at 11,999 yuan in Apple's store, is available for 10,698 yuan on Alibaba (NYSE: )'s e-commerce platform Taobao."
2022-10-23, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway Increases Stakes in Apple and Occidental Petroleum,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-increases-stakes-in-apple-and-occidental-petroleum-93CH-3861793,"Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), along with his associates Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been steadily increasing their investments in integrated energy company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ) and tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ). The investment team has been purchasing Occidental shares since 2022, now owning over 224 million shares. They have also expanded their already considerable $162 billion stake in Apple, a company that controls more than half of the U.S. smartphone market.

Buffett, despite not being particularly tech-savvy, appreciates Apple's commitment to innovation and its transformation into a platform company under CEO Tim Cook. The company's shift toward subscription services is expected to stabilize revenue during iPhone replacement cycles and enhance customer loyalty. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's revenue in the last twelve months was a staggering 383.93 billion USD. The company has also seen a solid return on assets of 28.23% in the third quarter of 2022.

Notably, InvestingPro Tips highlight that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares and has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years. This aligns with Buffett's strategy of investing in companies that pay dividends and are managed by solid teams. Buffett's investment in Apple is further supported by the fact that the company is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry and operates with a moderate level of debt.

Turning our attention to Occidental Petroleum, InvestingPro Tips indicate that the company has maintained dividend payments for 50 consecutive years and is expected to be profitable this year. The company's market cap is 57.66 billion USD, according to InvestingPro data, and it trades at a P/E ratio of 10.12. The company's stock generally trades with low price volatility, making it a relatively stable investment.

In addition to these investments, it is highly likely that Buffett and Charlie Munger have been buying Berkshire Hathaway shares in the third quarter and will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. This follows a 2018 amendment to the company's share repurchase program that allows buybacks if shares are considered undervalued and the company has at least $30 billion in cash and equivalents. Since this amendment, over $71 billion in buybacks have been approved in 20 out of 20 quarters, effectively increasing shareholders' ownership stakes. As of June 30, Berkshire Hathaway's cash pile was $147 billion, significantly surpassing the threshold for buybacks, which was previously set at 120% of book value.

Buffett's strategy of investing in brand-name companies that pay dividends and are managed by solid teams has led to a return of over 4,250,000% in Class A shares since the 1960s. Despite selling $33 billion worth of equities between October 2022 and June 2022, this strategy continues to reap benefits for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's investment activities can be tracked through mandatory quarterly 13F and Form 4 filings whenever Berkshire Hathaway has a stake of 10% or more in a public firm.

The M3 chip, developed using TSMC's 3nm process and incorporating hardware-accelerated ray tracing, is expected to enhance devices like MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and iMac.

The M3 Macs unveiling, referred to as Apple’s ""Scary Fast"" Halloween event, is anticipated to overshadow Qualcomm’s summit in Hawaii this week. The new chip is predicted to provide Apple with another 12 to 18 months of superiority in offering systems that can run Windows, Linux, or Mac. The company's control over hardware design, processor design, and OS gives it a unique advantage over competitors. This edge allows Apple to optimize real-world performance despite competitive processor benchmark figures.

Among the products expected to be spotlighted at the event are new 14-in. and 16-in. MacBook Pros equipped with M3 chips. There are also speculations about an upgrade to the iMac/iMac Pro and the introduction of Vision Pro. The M3 chips are expected to offer up to 12 to 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, and 36GB to 48GB of RAM.

Comparatively, Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite, a PC-class processor featuring 12 custom Oryon CPU cores, promises a 50% faster multi-threaded CPU performance than M2 but falls short of outperforming the M2 Max in single-threaded tasks. The Snapdragon X Elite also delivers multiple days of battery life for laptops and supports on-device generative AI processing.

If the M3 doesn't make an appearance at the event, Apple might present an M2 iMac and a potential M2-powered iPad Air as part of its product lineup. The event will be followed by Apple’s fourth-quarter financial announcement on November 2.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Google prepares defense in ongoing antitrust trial,https://in.investing.com/news/google-prepares-defense-in-ongoing-antitrust-trial-93CH-3865703,"In the ongoing antitrust trial, U.S. et al. v. Google (NASDAQ: ), the Department of Justice and state attorneys general are arguing that Google has employed illegal tactics to maintain its search and search ads monopolies, which they claim have resulted in harm to consumers and advertisers. As part of their case, the prosecution asserts that Google sustains its monopoly by paying over $10 billion annually to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms to secure default search engine status, hindering competition from other search engines like Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing and DuckDuckGo.

Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, argues that Google's significant scale creates a feedback loop that distorts the competitive landscape. The government’s case also emphasizes the negative impact of Google’s dominance on consumers and advertisers. They claim that Google's control over search delivers a lower-quality product and restricts consumer choice, particularly concerning privacy-respecting services.

Furthermore, the government alleges that Google's dominance in search has allowed it to control the online ad market, leading to inflated ad prices. Witnesses have included executives from Microsoft, Bing, major advertisers like Home Depot (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), DuckDuckGo, and former Google employees such as Sridhar Ramaswamy.

Joshua Lowcock, an executive from an ad buying firm, testified about Google's share of search and its appeal to his firm’s clients. Arjan Dijk, a former Google executive now at Booking (NASDAQ: ).com, discussed Google’s dominant pool of potential customers. Evidence presented includes an email from Jerry Dischler, a Google executive discussing potential strategies to increase ad revenue and testimony from Jeff Hurst, the former COO of Expedia (NASDAQ: ), about Vrbo's experience with Google's inflated ad prices.

Presiding Judge Amit P. Mehta heard testimony from Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, about his company's struggles due to Google’s control over default search engines. Today, Google is preparing for its defense, maintaining that users can easily switch default search engines and that it continuously improves its search engine for the benefit of consumers.

This new chip, designed for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Windows-based laptops, is claimed to surpass Apple's (NASDAQ: ) Mac chips in certain tasks.

Anticipated for release in laptops next year, the X Elite focuses on enhanced AI functionalities such as summarizing emails, writing text, and generating images.

This announcement follows reports of Microsoft urging Qualcomm and other tech giants to produce chips for AI-enhanced Windows features.

Qualcomm aims to challenge Apple, which has seen a significant market share increase in laptop and desktop computers since launching its custom-designed chips in 2020.

Qualcomm asserts the X Elite outperforms Apple's M2 Max chip in speed at some tasks and both Apple and Intel (NASDAQ: ) PC chips in energy efficiency. However, its standout feature, according to Qualcomm Senior VP, is the capability to process AI models with 13 billion parameters, making it exceptionally advanced for AI text or image generation tasks. The Senior VP emphasized the unparalleled speed of these models, stating, ""No one else in the world can do that"" on a laptop."
2022-10-24, Investing.com,Qualcomm unveils Snapdragon X Elite to challenge Intel and Apple,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-unveils-snapdragon-x-elite-to-challenge-intel-and-apple-93CH-3864785,"Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) has announced the launch of its new Snapdragon X Elite chip, a product of their refined SoC and processor development strategy. The high-performance chip is set to compete with Apple (NASDAQ: )'s M2 chip in Windows laptops and is expected to debut in mid-2024.

The Snapdragon X Elite, constructed on a 4nm process, employs an Oryon three-cluster CPU configuration with twelve 3.8GHZ cores that can boost to 4.3GHz for two cores during AI generation or other intensive tasks. The chip supports the LPDDR5x memory standard, currently the fastest for PCs, and accommodates up to 64GB of LPDDR5x-8533 memory.

The new chip also features Adreno integrated graphics offering up to 4.6 TFLOPS of GPU performance and DirectX 12 support. It showcases superior display capabilities, handling larger workspaces with two 5K external displays, three external UHD displays, or onboard displays at 4K with a 120Hz refresh rate. However, the real-life performance of these features is yet to be determined.

In terms of connectivity, the Snapdragon X Elite supports WiFi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, USB4, and multiple cameras via a dual 18-bit Qualcomm Spectra image signal processor. Device makers have the option to opt for the Snapdragon X65 modem for 4G/5G connectivity.

The Hexagon NPU, rated for 45 TOPs, underscores Qualcomm's commitment to AI. Qualcomm claims an impressive 100x increase in operations per second over unnamed leading competitors and efficient artificial operations processing with this new chip. High-end Qualcomm sound processing equips the X Elite with lossless audio.

The company touts the Snapdragon X Elite as a robust processor that offers double the CPU performance at the same power usage as Intel’s 12-core i7 and requires 65% less power for similar performance to a 14-core i7. Despite its AI focus, the SoC maintains efficient cooling and battery life.

However, it's worth noting that a fast processor alone doesn't ensure a good Windows PC user experience; software compatibility is crucial. Qualcomm's chips have previously struggled with slower speeds than Apple's chips and inefficient x86 Windows apps on Qualcomm-equipped PCs. Consequently, the potential of the Snapdragon X Elite in making PCs competitive with those featuring Intel (NASDAQ: ) or AMD chips remains to be seen.

The Snapdragon X Elite is set to compete with next-gen chips like Intel’s Meteor Lake and AMD’s Ryzen 8000 upon its release. With its advanced features and potential, the chip represents Qualcomm's efforts to stake its claim in the high-performance chip market.

The analysts explained that their latest survey indicates Apple plans to purchase 2,000 to 3,000 and 18,000 to 20,000 units of AI servers in 2022 and 2024, respectively, representing ""about 1.3% and 5% of worldwide AI server shipments in 2022 and 2024, respectively.""

""We think it’s reasonable to assume that the AI servers Apple purchases are primarily this year’s most popular specification: Nvidia’s HGX H100 8-GPU, designed for generative AI training and inference,"" the analysts said. ""It’s also expected that some shipments in 4Q24 will likely upgrade to the B100 solution.""

They estimate that Apple will spend at least about $620 million in 2022 and $4.75 billion in 2024, although they note that the AI server purchases are significantly lower in 2022 than in 2024 due to a shortage of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) AI chips starting from 2Q23.

Even if the supply of Nvidia AI chips improves in 2024, Apple’s AI server purchases still lag behind its competitors, the analysts said.

""It’s reasonable to estimate that Apple would have to invest at least several billion US dollars annually to have a chance of catching up with its competitors,"" they added.

""If Apple really intends to spend only a billion dollars a year on generative AI development, it won’t matter much if our survey is wrong, but we are genuinely concerned about the future of Apple’s generative AI business/service."""

He was ""told that Apple is planning a Mac-centered product launch around the end of this month"".

According to the report, several configurations of the iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and other higher-end Pro models won't ship until November.

The tech giant organised its “Wonderlust” event in September, where it revealed the new iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, and AirPods Pro with USB-C charging.

The analysts, who maintained a Neutral rating and $208 price target on the stock, said that over the past few months, there have been a series of articles that highlight Apple's exposure to China. They noted risks such as the supplier investigation, government ban, and App Store non-compliance.

In BofA's opinion, the highest risk is the production dependence on China, followed by the risk of a negative China policy response, and finally, domestic demand in China across products and services. The analysts note that the production risk is the hardest to diversify from, while the policy risk is the hardest to handicap.

""CEO Tim Cook has navigated these challenges in an extraordinarily nimble fashion,"" the analysts wrote. ""We see higher risk to the valuation multiple vs. earnings estimates at this point in time.""

2022-10-24, Investing.com,Nvidia And Amd Set Sights On Arm-Based CPU Market by 2025,https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-and-amd-set-sights-on-armbased-cpu-market-by-2025-93CH-3863283,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and AMD, two major players in the tech industry, are making strategic moves to enter the CPU market with Arm-based chips by 2025, a move inspired by Apple (NASDAQ: )'s success in this arena. According to preliminary third-quarter data from IDC, Apple's market share has nearly doubled, influencing Nvidia and AMD's decision to expand their product portfolios.

In response to these developments, the market reacted with a 3.84% increase in Nvidia shares while Intel (NASDAQ: ) saw a 3.06% decline. Despite the market's reaction, Intel remains undeterred, recently showcasing a laptop with AI capabilities akin to ChatGPT, thus demonstrating its strategic vision for the future of computing.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is backing this industry shift towards AI-enhanced software like Copilot and away from reliance on Intel. However, potential software compatibility issues are anticipated due to the transition from x86 to Arm-based designs.

Nvidia's foray into the Arm-based chip market isn't its first partnership with Microsoft. The two companies previously collaborated on the Surface RT project, which did not see success. Nonetheless, this new endeavor sees them joining forces once again.

AMD's entry into the Arm chip market is particularly notable as it introduces fresh dynamics into the industry. This comes despite AMD's ongoing performance-per-watt competition with x86.

In addition to Nvidia and AMD, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) is also a significant player in this competition. Having been manufacturing Arm-based chips since 2016, Qualcomm plans to reveal a flagship chip designed by ex-Apple engineers at an upcoming Microsoft event featuring VP of Windows and Devices, Pavan Davuluri.

These developments indicate a significant shift in the tech industry as companies align their strategies with the growing popularity and success of Arm-based chips.

The companies have added nearly $4tn to their market capitalization in 2022 alone, overshadowing the $3.4tn increase for the entire MSCI index. This significant influence has even affected markets abroad, with the facing a potential decline without their contributions.

Today, US companies account for 61% of the $60tn MSCI index, a considerable rise from less than 50% a decade ago. The ten largest stocks now constitute almost 19% of the index, a substantial increase from 8% in 2013.

However, global stocks have experienced instability over recent months due to concerns about interest rates and geopolitical risks such as the Israel-Hamas conflict. US stocks currently trade at about 18 times their expected earnings over the next year, compared to 12 times for the MSCI all-country excluding US stocks.

In this climate, Max Gokhman from Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and Jurrien Timmer from Fidelity have both suggested that non-US stocks being cheaper does not necessarily mean they will outperform. They caution that the ""magnificent seven"" could face pressure if they fail to demonstrate tangible benefits from AI growth next year. However, they also suggest that growth stocks could see benefits when interest rates start to decline.

In related news, OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, is currently discussing a share sale with investors that would value it at about $86bn, tripling its value since April.

The ongoing dominance of US firms in global markets has sparked concerns about a potential US monopoly. This could potentially drain liquidity from other markets and incentivize companies to relocate their listings for higher valuations and trading volumes in the US.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,“Magnificent 7” Tech Giants Initiate Q3 Earnings Season,https://in.investing.com/news/magnificent-7-tech-giants-initiate-q3-earnings-season-93CH-3863025,"The ""Magnificent 7"" of , including Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), have initiated their Q3 earnings season. Despite Tesla's disappointing results causing a 10% stock drop, the remaining six tech giants show promise despite macroeconomic concerns like rising bond yields, inflation fears, and the Israel-Hamas war's oil price impact.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

The Wall Street Breakfast Survey is assessing investors' top holdings among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. For broader Big Tech exposure, investors might consider MicroSectors FANG+ ETN and Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Nvidia to design Arm-based PC chips, posing fresh challenge to Intel",https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-to-design-armbased-pc-chips-posing-fresh-challenge-to-intel-432SI-3862943,"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), known for its dominance in AI computing chips, is now coming after Intel's (NASDAQ: ) personal computer domain. NVIDIA is in the early stages of crafting CPUs compatible with Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) Windows, leveraging Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) technology, according to a Reuters report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

This aligns with Microsoft's strategy to support companies in producing Arm-based chips for Windows PCs, in part to compete with Apple's (NASDAQ: ) growing market share from its proprietary Arm-based Mac chips.

Similarly, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is exploring Arm technology for PCs, with both NVIDIA and AMD potentially releasing these chips by 2025. They'd be in the company of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), an Arm-based chip producer for laptops since 2016.

The efforts of NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) have the potential to disrupt the PC market, which has been long dominated by Intel, especially with growing challenges from Apple.

Apple's custom Mac chips, with their energy efficiency and speedy performance, are challenging Intel's PC industry lead. Recognizing Apple's success, Microsoft aims for comparable efficiency. Initially, Microsoft selected Qualcomm to develop Windows-compatible chips, offering an exclusivity deal until 2024. According to the sources, has encouraged others to enter the market once that exclusivity deal expires.

Microsoft is urging chip manufacturers to incorporate sophisticated AI functionalities into their CPUs. They foresee AI-driven software, like Copilot, becoming integral to the Windows experience. For this vision, upcoming chips from Nvidia, AMD, and others must allocate sufficient on-chip resources.

However, the success of Microsoft and these chip companies in this venture is uncertain. Developers have spent decades and invested massive funds in crafting Windows code for the x86 computing architecture, which is owned by Intel but also licensed to AMD. Codes tailored for x86 won't directly fit Arm-based configurations, making the shift potentially problematic.

Following the Reuters report, NVIDIA shares jumped more than 3% today, while Intel fell around 3%."
2022-10-23, Investing.com,Apple Intensifies AI Push With $1 Billion Investment,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-intensifies-ai-push-with-1-billion-investment-93CH-3862746,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly ramping up its efforts in generative artificial intelligence (AI), planning a $1 billion investment to integrate AI tools into Siri, Apple Music, and other applications. The tech giant's move is aimed at competing with Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard AI bot and OpenAI’s ChatGPT, according to Bloomberg.

The company has posted several job openings focused on AI, indicating its intent to develop a generative AI-based developer experience platform for internal use and support the app development team. One particular opening in the Apple Retail department is geared towards developing a conversational AI platform for customer engagement.

Apple is also exploring ways to incorporate generative AI into development tools such as Xcode, presentation software Keynote, and apps like Pages for creating auto-generated playlists. These efforts are part of the company's larger initiative to infuse AI into its product suite and services.

In addition to these developments, Apple has built Ajax, a language model, and Apple GPT, a chatbot. These tools are awaiting integration into Siri, Messages, Xcode for aiding developers, and Apple Music for auto-playlists.

According to InvestingPro, Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is often seen as a sign of confidence in the company's future prospects. The tech giant also yields a high return on invested capital, and its strong earnings should allow the management to continue dividend payments. Moreover, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which is a testament to its financial stability and commitment to rewarding shareholders. InvestingPro Tips also suggest that Apple operates with a high return on assets, which is an indication of the company's efficiency in using its resources.

Even with these advancements, compared to Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s investment in OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google's Bard AI bot, Apple's public AI initiatives are still considered lagging. Its only notable AI achievement so far has been an enhanced auto-correct feature in iOS 17.

The market has reacted moderately optimistically to Apple's AI push. The firm's shares have surged by nearly 37% in 2022. Analysts have given Apple's stock 20 Buys and nine Holds, with an average price target of $207.51, suggesting a 20.2% upside potential. InvestingPro data shows that Apple's market cap is $2710.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 28.88 and a PEG ratio of -19.75, which investors may want to consider when evaluating the company's valuation.

When queried by Seeking Alpha about these developments, Apple chose not to comment. However, with a revenue of $383.93B USD and an operating income of $112.23B USD as per InvestingPro data, Apple's financial health appears to be strong, which could support its ambitious AI initiatives.

At 09:41 ET (13:41 GMT), the was down 200 points or 0.6%, while the was down 0.7% and the was down 0.9%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indexes on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based S&P dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Chevron set to buy Hess for $53 billion

Elsewhere, the oil market is once more the center of major M&A, as Chevron (NYSE: ) announced plans to buy smaller rival Hess (NYSE: ) in a $53-billion all-stock deal, implying a premium of about 4.9% to the share's last close. Chevron shares fell 2.7%, while Hess shares rose 0.6%.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower 1.5% after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion, which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,Apple Shares Trade At Fair Value Amidst Market Volatility,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-shares-trade-at-fair-value-amidst-market-volatility-93CH-3862220,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s shares, currently trading at $173, are considered fairly priced, according to a recent valuation model. This evaluation places the tech giant's stock at approximately 7.70% above its intrinsic value of $160.52, suggesting that investors are purchasing the shares at a reasonable rate. The InvestingPro data shows an adjusted market cap of $2700.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 28.99, which supports this valuation.

The company's stock has experienced significant price fluctuations recently, with highs reaching $196 and lows dipping to $170. These shifts have sparked questions about Apple's actual worth and whether it may be undervalued. The firm's high beta indicates a greater level of price volatility compared to the overall market. This volatility can present buying opportunities for investors during bearish periods. Notably, Apple's stock generally trades with low price volatility, as noted in the InvestingPro Tips.

Looking ahead, Apple's future seems promising with an anticipated 21% growth in earnings. This projection further bolsters the view that the company's shares are appropriately valued, despite the recent market turbulence. The InvestingPro Tips also highlight that Apple's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments and that the company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be appealing to income-focused investors.

Furthermore, Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is often a positive sign of the company's faith in its own future growth. The company also yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets - all these factors indicate a strong financial position and potential for future growth.

In addition to these insights, InvestingPro offers 17 more tips about Apple, which can be found at InvestingPro. These tips could provide valuable insights for potential investors and help them make more informed decisions.

The InvestingPro data also reveals a revenue LTM2022.Q3 of 383.93B USD and a gross profit LTM2022.Q3 of 166.82B USD. While the revenue growth LTM2022.Q3 shows a slight decline of -0.93%, the company's strong financials and promising future outlook offer a compelling case for investment.

Asian investor confidence was shaken as Beijing initiated several investigations into Foxconn (TW: ), a key Apple supplier.

According to local media reports, the tax inspections were conducted at Foxconn facilities in two Chinese provinces. Moreover, China's natural resources department conducted on-site investigations into land use by key Foxconn businesses in the provinces of Henan and Hubei.

Foxconn has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the investigation.

""Legal compliance everywhere we operate around the world is a fundamental principle of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn),"" the company said in a statement.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations.”

It could be that China is hitting back at the U.S. by targeting one of its biggest companies - Apple.

Elsewhere, Reuters reported that Chinese retailers are offering deep iPhone 15 discounts.

Chinese e-commerce platforms, including Pinduoduo (NASDAQ: ) and Taobao, are providing significant discounts on Apple's iPhone 15 series, selling some models for up to 900 yuan ($123) below the retail price.

Pinduoduo is reportedly selling the 128 GB version of the iPhone 15 Plus for 6,098 yuan, which is 900 yuan less than Apple's retail price of 6,999 yuan.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway Increases Stakes in Apple and Occidental Petroleum,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-increases-stakes-in-apple-and-occidental-petroleum-93CH-3861793,"Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), along with his associates Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been steadily increasing their investments in integrated energy company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ) and tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ). The investment team has been purchasing Occidental shares since 2022, now owning over 224 million shares. They have also expanded their already considerable $162 billion stake in Apple, a company that controls more than half of the U.S. smartphone market.

Buffett, despite not being particularly tech-savvy, appreciates Apple's commitment to innovation and its transformation into a platform company under CEO Tim Cook. The company's shift toward subscription services is expected to stabilize revenue during iPhone replacement cycles and enhance customer loyalty. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's revenue in the last twelve months was a staggering 383.93 billion USD. The company has also seen a solid return on assets of 28.23% in the third quarter of 2022.

Notably, InvestingPro Tips highlight that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares and has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years. This aligns with Buffett's strategy of investing in companies that pay dividends and are managed by solid teams. Buffett's investment in Apple is further supported by the fact that the company is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry and operates with a moderate level of debt.

Turning our attention to Occidental Petroleum, InvestingPro Tips indicate that the company has maintained dividend payments for 50 consecutive years and is expected to be profitable this year. The company's market cap is 57.66 billion USD, according to InvestingPro data, and it trades at a P/E ratio of 10.12. The company's stock generally trades with low price volatility, making it a relatively stable investment.

In addition to these investments, it is highly likely that Buffett and Charlie Munger have been buying Berkshire Hathaway shares in the third quarter and will continue to do so in the fourth quarter. This follows a 2018 amendment to the company's share repurchase program that allows buybacks if shares are considered undervalued and the company has at least $30 billion in cash and equivalents. Since this amendment, over $71 billion in buybacks have been approved in 20 out of 20 quarters, effectively increasing shareholders' ownership stakes. As of June 30, Berkshire Hathaway's cash pile was $147 billion, significantly surpassing the threshold for buybacks, which was previously set at 120% of book value.

Buffett's strategy of investing in brand-name companies that pay dividends and are managed by solid teams has led to a return of over 4,250,000% in Class A shares since the 1960s. Despite selling $33 billion worth of equities between October 2022 and June 2022, this strategy continues to reap benefits for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's investment activities can be tracked through mandatory quarterly 13F and Form 4 filings whenever Berkshire Hathaway has a stake of 10% or more in a public firm.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially hitting supply in the important region."
2022-10-23, IANS,US allows faster 6 GHz band to drive AR-VR headset industry,https://in.investing.com/news/us-allows-faster-6-ghz-band-to-drive-arvr-headset-industry-3861327,"Washington, Oct 23 (IANS) The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has finally approved the 6 GHz band to a new class of very low-power devices (including AR-VR headsets) that will operate alongside other WiFi-enabled devices.The decision will help headsets like the Apple (NASDAQ: ) Vision Pro and the Meta (NASDAQ: ) Quest 3 get faster data transfers and less interference.

Apple, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Meta have all been lobbying for access to the 6GHz band since 2019.

“These rules will spur an eco-system of cutting-edge applications, including wearable technologies and augmented and virtual reality, that will help businesses, enhance learning opportunities, advance healthcare opportunities, and bring new entertainment experiences,” the FCC said in a statement.

Allowing the 6 GHz band will also help the the Internet of Things (IoT) market grow further.

“Recognising the need to provide even more flexibility and foster unlicensed innovation, the Commission established rules that permit devices that operate at very low power (VLP) across short distances and provide very high connection speeds,” the FCC said in a statement.

These include, for example, advanced augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), wearable sensors and technologies, and variety of Internet of Things devices.

The new rules, however, are careful to limit these devices to very low power levels and subject them to other technical and operational requirements.

Meta recently launched a new mixed reality (MR) headset called Quest 3 with a 30 per cent enhancement in visual resolution and 40 per cent louder audio range than Quest 2.

Billed as the first mass-market mixed reality headset with 4K+ Infinite Display, it starts at $499.99 for the 128GB version and $649.99 for those who want a larger storage capacity at 512GB.

Priced at $3,499, Apple Vision Pro will be available in the US in early 2024, before expanding to other nations at a later date.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,US Treasury yield near 5% amid tech earnings and global economic data,https://in.investing.com/news/us-treasury-yield-near-5-amid-tech-earnings-and-global-economic-data-93CH-3861219,"The previous week saw the 10-year US Treasury yield nearing a significant 5%, which led to a decline in stocks due to its record correlation with the . The current scenario suggests that both stocks and bond prices are falling in unison, driven by concerns over prolonged interest rates and term premium. This comes as investors consider factors such as the long-term inflation outlook, bond supply, and government spending plans.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

2022-10-22, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3860952,"Investing.com -- The risk-off mood dominating markets looks likely to continue in the coming week, while four out of seven megacap companies are due to report earnings. U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

The analysts comment ""The iPhone 15 lineup has been available for pre-order in most geographies since Sep 15th , and lead times for the Pro/Pro Max models have been somewhat mixed; the US, China, and Japan were stable vs. last week while UK/Germany lead times were down by 7-9 days on average. All delivery times referenced are for delivery of a “sim-free” phone from the Apple website. We would also note that delivery times referenced here represent the free delivery option, though in the U.S., some iPhone 15 models can be delivered faster should the customer choose to pay an extra delivery fee. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are now seeing time to first delivery estimates of 28 days for the Pro Max and 21 days for the Pro in the US, while China carries slightly lower lead times of 18-21 days. Other countries we track are lower in the 9-21 day zone on average for the Pro/Pro Max models. We note that the Pro Max model lead times in UK and Germany were lower, on average, over the past week. For the lower-end models, all countries saw contractions to 2-4 days now. Overall, USA lead times are tracking in-line vs. a year ago while China is slightly weaker. Finally, we would also caveat that delivery times could be a reflection of strong demand or weak supply – though we suspect given the variation in wait times that this data set more likely suggests higher demand. We note that our methodology for time to first delivery uses the average of a time series when a range is provided. Net/net: The data points continue to point to stable demand for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models vs. a year ago across most geographies, while the lower-end models lead times saw big contractions this week.

2022-10-20, IANS,iPhone sales cross 1.5 mn million units in 1st week of India festive season,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-sales-cross-15-mn-million-units-in-1st-week-of-india-festive-season-3859081,"New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS) iPhone sales crossed 1.5 million units during the first week of festive sales in India for the first time ever, registering more than 25 per cent growth (year-on-year), a report showed on Friday.The festive season smartphone sales grew 25 per cent (on-year) in value in the first week (October 8-15) driven by strong demand for Samsung (KS: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Xiaomi devices, according to Counterpoint Research.

Online channels, which experienced slow demand throughout the year, registered a bigger-than-expected surge in demand, prompting them to raise prices from the third day of the sales week.

Around 80 per cent of phones sold on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Flipkart during first 48 hours were 5G capable.

On Flipkart, the premium segment growth was almost 50 per cent YoY driven by the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S21 FE, while on Amazon, the segment growth was almost 200 per cent driven by the iPhone 13 and Galaxy S23 FE.

This year, the iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone 12 all experienced high demand, unlike a year ago when the iPhone 13 was the major driver.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE alsowitnessed strong sales. The model was sold out after two days of the sale on Flipkart.

The Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 price segment witnessed faster 5G upgrades as OEMs launched many devices ahead of the festive season.

The realme Narzo 60x 5G, Galaxy M14 5G and M34 5G were the top sellers on Amazon,while the vivo T2x was the top seller on Flipkart.

“We are witnessing strong demand for premium devices even after the first week of sales, driven by the availability of many financing and credit schemes, including per-day EMIs,” the report mentioned.

The strong consumer sentiment will continue in offline sales as well due to parity between offline and online discounts.

“Overall, we believe the festive season smartphone sales this year will grow 7 per cent YoY in terms of volumes while the average selling price (ASP) will grow 15 per cent YoY,” the report said.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Apple’s Fiscal Q4 Results Anticipation Amid Robust Financials and Growth Potential,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-fiscal-q4-results-anticipation-amid-robust-financials-and-growth-potential-93CH-3858194,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the globally recognized iPhone producer, is set to announce its fiscal fourth quarter results on November 3. This comes in the wake of a 9% decrease in the company's stock value since August 1, stirring deliberations among investors about the optimal timing for investment. Apple's strong financial standing and potential for expansion suggest that it could be an opportune moment for purchasing shares.

The tech giant's market cap currently stands at nearly $2.8 trillion, a figure confirmed by InvestingPro's real-time metrics. This colossal valuation is backed by over 2 billion active devices, including iPhones. It generates more than $100 billion in annual free cash flow and ended its recent quarter with a net cash position of $57 billion after debt. This strong financial position enabled Apple to return more than $24 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last quarter alone.

InvestingPro Tips reveal that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is a strong vote of confidence in the company's future. Additionally, the company yields a high return on invested capital, which, combined with strong earnings, allows management to continue dividend payments. In fact, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, further demonstrating its financial health.

Even though a foreign-exchange headwind led to a 1% year-over-year revenue drop in fiscal Q3, there are promising areas for growth. The services segment, which includes AppleCare, App Store transactions and subscriptions, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, recorded an 8% YoY growth in the same quarter. Additionally, Apple achieved record revenue in emerging markets like India, indicating potential for further expansion.

With these factors in mind, the company's current valuation of less than 30 times earnings is seen as reasonable ahead of its fiscal Q4 results announcement. InvestingPro's real-time metrics show a P/E Ratio of 29.72, reinforcing this viewpoint. The recent slump in Apple's stock price presents a unique opportunity for investors to acquire shares at a lower cost.

2022-10-19, IANS,"ICEA hails import authorisation amendment for IT hardware, breather for PC makers",https://in.investing.com/news/icea-hails-import-authorisation-amendment-for-it-hardware-breather-for-pc-makers-3857447,"New Delhi, Oct 19 (IANS) The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) on Thursday welcomed the government’s decision to maintain restriction-free imports of laptops and tablets until September 2024.The transition towards the Import Management System, scheduled to initiate from November 1, 2022, is now being meticulously worked upon in collaboration with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce, to ensure a streamlined adaptation from the current processes.

The announcement comes as a vital support to the industry amid its progressive dialogues with the government to shape import norms, said the ICEA.

""This decision not only addresses immediate industry concerns but also lays a solid foundation for a structured dialogue towards fostering a robust domestic IT hardware manufacturing ecosystem,"" ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.

The move is a breather for companies like HP, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Dell, Lenovo and others who rely on imports to meet the surge in demand in the country for their PCs, laptops and tablets, especially in the festive season.

Meanwhile, the Centre has asked the PC and laptop companies to share their import data for the last three years, according to industry sources. Last month, PC and laptop makers met the IT Ministry officials to rethink its decision on import licensing requirements accompanied by a quota.

The meeting discussed proposed changes, like linking the import of IT hardware to the local manufacturing of a company value and its export value of electronic items.

Mohindroo emphasised the importance of such policy adjustments in facilitating India's journey towards becoming a self-reliant and globally competitive electronics manufacturing hub.

""The industry is now working with DGFT to ensure a smooth transition from the current process to the Import Management System from November 1,"" he added.

This government aims $300 billion in production for the electronics manufacturing sector by FY26. The recently-introduced Production-Linked Incentive (PLI 2.0) Scheme for IT Hardware has an outlay of about Rs 22,890 crore over the six years.

In the initial 17 days of the iPhone 15's availability, sales were down 4.5% compared to the previous iPhone 14, as reported by Counterpoint.

Huawei's strong performance is seen as a significant achievement, particularly in the face of U.S. technology sanctions, which have forced the company to rely more on domestically made chips.

“The trend suggests iPhone would lose to Huawei in 2024,” analysts at Jefferies wrote in a recent note to clients.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,"Powell's speech, Netflix, Tesla earnings - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powells-speech-netflix-tesla-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3857185,"Investing.com -- Fed chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the session, while Wall Street indices are set to open lower after bond yields rose to record levels.The earnings season continues in full flow, with Netflix and Tesla in the spotlight after releasing results after Wednesday's close.

1. Powell’s speech in the spotlight

is set to hold the spotlight Thursday, as the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at the Economic Club of New York later in the session, with markets nervous that he may strike a hawkish tone after a series of U.S. data pointed to strength in the economy.

Fed policy makers had recently signaled that the central bank may be close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, as rising yields have done some of their job in cooling the economy by reining in credit.

However, recent data has indicated that the labor market remains strong and inflation sticky, and this prompted New York Federal Reserve president to take a more hawkish stance, stating Wednesday that the Fed will likely keep rates higher for longer for “some time” to rein in inflation toward its 2% target.

The benchmark surged on Wednesday, trading past 4.9% for the first time since 2007.

Another pause on rate hikes for November is nearly fully priced in, according to Investing’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool , but the odds of a December rate hike have jumped to 40% this week from 26% last week.

2. Futures sell off as risk sentiment takes a hit

U.S. stock futures traded lower Thursday, continuing the previous session’s weakness as rising bond yields prompted investors to exit more risky assets.

At 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT), the contract dropped 100 points or 0.3%, fell by 13 points or 0.3%, and dropped by 34 points or 0.2%.

The major indices closed lower Wednesday, weighed by escalating tensions in the Middle East and worries over elevated bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since mid-2007.

Investors have started to become fearful of the possibility of another rate increase in December to round out the year, and all eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he speaks later in the session [see above].

Economic data on deck include weekly , for September and the for October.

There are more earnings to digest during the session [see below], while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the two corporate powerhouses reported results after the close Wednesday.

3. Netflix soars with new subscribers; Tesla disappoints

Netflix’s subscription service was in demand in the third quarter, as the streaming giant shattered expectations for new customers, sending its stock surging over 12% in premarket trading.

The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, boosted by its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts, well above expectations for just over 6 million.

These gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, in the early days of the global pandemic.

Substantial subscriber additions came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.

Netflix also increased subscription prices for some of its streaming plans as it posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with forecasts. Earnings came in at $3.73 per share, ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $3.49.

Tesla, on the other hand, disappointed with its quarterly results as its recent wave of electric vehicle price cuts weighed on margins. Its stock fell over 4% premarket.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the third quarter from 18.7% in the previous quarter.

Tesla delivered 435,000 EVs in the quarter, down from 466,140 in the second quarter, with the company citing upgrades at various factories for the decline in production volumes.

Tesla was also cautious about expanding electric vehicle production capacity, with CEO Elon Musk saying he was worried that higher borrowing costs would prevent potential customers from affording its vehicles despite substantial price cuts.

4. Third-quarter earnings season continues

The quarterly earnings season continues Thursday, with results due from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), telecoms company AT&T (NYSE: ), tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE: ), railroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: ), asset manager Blackstone (NYSE: ) as well as a number of regional banks.

So far, admittedly very early in the season, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Earlier Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier, posted an almost 25% fall in third-quarter net profit as global economic woes hit demand for chips used in applications from cars to cellphones and servers.

Nokia (NYSE: ) announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs in a new cost reduction effort after the Finnish telecom gear manufacturer’s third-quarter sales fell by a fifth, taken down by sales of next-generation 5G equipment.

5. Crude’s recent rally cools

Oil prices fell Thursday, handing back a lot of the previous session’s sharp gains, as markets awaited more developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the outlook for global supply.

By 04:50 ET, the futures traded 1.7% lower at $85.75 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.7% to $89.78 a barrel.

Crude prices climbed about 2% in the previous session on concerns of disruptions to global supplies after Iran called for an oil embargo on Israel over the conflict in Gaza and after the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, reported a larger-than-expected draw.

However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has shown few signs of taking any immediate action on Iran's call, easing worries over potential disruptions.

Prices have also been pressured after a deal was reached between the Venezuelan government and the country's political opposition to ensure fair 2024 elections, potentially allowing the country’s oil flows to reenter the global market after years of sanctions."

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially hitting supply in the important region."
2022-10-23, IANS,US allows faster 6 GHz band to drive AR-VR headset industry,https://in.investing.com/news/us-allows-faster-6-ghz-band-to-drive-arvr-headset-industry-3861327,"Washington, Oct 23 (IANS) The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has finally approved the 6 GHz band to a new class of very low-power devices (including AR-VR headsets) that will operate alongside other WiFi-enabled devices.The decision will help headsets like the Apple (NASDAQ: ) Vision Pro and the Meta (NASDAQ: ) Quest 3 get faster data transfers and less interference.

Apple, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Meta have all been lobbying for access to the 6GHz band since 2019.

“These rules will spur an eco-system of cutting-edge applications, including wearable technologies and augmented and virtual reality, that will help businesses, enhance learning opportunities, advance healthcare opportunities, and bring new entertainment experiences,” the FCC said in a statement.

Allowing the 6 GHz band will also help the the Internet of Things (IoT) market grow further.

“Recognising the need to provide even more flexibility and foster unlicensed innovation, the Commission established rules that permit devices that operate at very low power (VLP) across short distances and provide very high connection speeds,” the FCC said in a statement.

These include, for example, advanced augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), wearable sensors and technologies, and variety of Internet of Things devices.

The new rules, however, are careful to limit these devices to very low power levels and subject them to other technical and operational requirements.

Meta recently launched a new mixed reality (MR) headset called Quest 3 with a 30 per cent enhancement in visual resolution and 40 per cent louder audio range than Quest 2.

Billed as the first mass-market mixed reality headset with 4K+ Infinite Display, it starts at $499.99 for the 128GB version and $649.99 for those who want a larger storage capacity at 512GB.

Priced at $3,499, Apple Vision Pro will be available in the US in early 2024, before expanding to other nations at a later date.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

2022-10-22, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3860952,"Investing.com -- The risk-off mood dominating markets looks likely to continue in the coming week, while four out of seven megacap companies are due to report earnings. U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

The analysts comment ""The iPhone 15 lineup has been available for pre-order in most geographies since Sep 15th , and lead times for the Pro/Pro Max models have been somewhat mixed; the US, China, and Japan were stable vs. last week while UK/Germany lead times were down by 7-9 days on average. All delivery times referenced are for delivery of a “sim-free” phone from the Apple website. We would also note that delivery times referenced here represent the free delivery option, though in the U.S., some iPhone 15 models can be delivered faster should the customer choose to pay an extra delivery fee. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are now seeing time to first delivery estimates of 28 days for the Pro Max and 21 days for the Pro in the US, while China carries slightly lower lead times of 18-21 days. Other countries we track are lower in the 9-21 day zone on average for the Pro/Pro Max models. We note that the Pro Max model lead times in UK and Germany were lower, on average, over the past week. For the lower-end models, all countries saw contractions to 2-4 days now. Overall, USA lead times are tracking in-line vs. a year ago while China is slightly weaker. Finally, we would also caveat that delivery times could be a reflection of strong demand or weak supply – though we suspect given the variation in wait times that this data set more likely suggests higher demand. We note that our methodology for time to first delivery uses the average of a time series when a range is provided. Net/net: The data points continue to point to stable demand for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models vs. a year ago across most geographies, while the lower-end models lead times saw big contractions this week.

2022-10-20, IANS,iPhone sales cross 1.5 mn million units in 1st week of India festive season,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-sales-cross-15-mn-million-units-in-1st-week-of-india-festive-season-3859081,"New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS) iPhone sales crossed 1.5 million units during the first week of festive sales in India for the first time ever, registering more than 25 per cent growth (year-on-year), a report showed on Friday.The festive season smartphone sales grew 25 per cent (on-year) in value in the first week (October 8-15) driven by strong demand for Samsung (KS: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Xiaomi devices, according to Counterpoint Research.

Online channels, which experienced slow demand throughout the year, registered a bigger-than-expected surge in demand, prompting them to raise prices from the third day of the sales week.

Around 80 per cent of phones sold on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Flipkart during first 48 hours were 5G capable.

On Flipkart, the premium segment growth was almost 50 per cent YoY driven by the iPhone 14 and Galaxy S21 FE, while on Amazon, the segment growth was almost 200 per cent driven by the iPhone 13 and Galaxy S23 FE.

This year, the iPhone 14, iPhone 13 and iPhone 12 all experienced high demand, unlike a year ago when the iPhone 13 was the major driver.

The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE alsowitnessed strong sales. The model was sold out after two days of the sale on Flipkart.

The Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 price segment witnessed faster 5G upgrades as OEMs launched many devices ahead of the festive season.

The realme Narzo 60x 5G, Galaxy M14 5G and M34 5G were the top sellers on Amazon,while the vivo T2x was the top seller on Flipkart.

“We are witnessing strong demand for premium devices even after the first week of sales, driven by the availability of many financing and credit schemes, including per-day EMIs,” the report mentioned.

The strong consumer sentiment will continue in offline sales as well due to parity between offline and online discounts.

“Overall, we believe the festive season smartphone sales this year will grow 7 per cent YoY in terms of volumes while the average selling price (ASP) will grow 15 per cent YoY,” the report said.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Apple’s Fiscal Q4 Results Anticipation Amid Robust Financials and Growth Potential,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-fiscal-q4-results-anticipation-amid-robust-financials-and-growth-potential-93CH-3858194,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the globally recognized iPhone producer, is set to announce its fiscal fourth quarter results on November 3. This comes in the wake of a 9% decrease in the company's stock value since August 1, stirring deliberations among investors about the optimal timing for investment. Apple's strong financial standing and potential for expansion suggest that it could be an opportune moment for purchasing shares.

The tech giant's market cap currently stands at nearly $2.8 trillion, a figure confirmed by InvestingPro's real-time metrics. This colossal valuation is backed by over 2 billion active devices, including iPhones. It generates more than $100 billion in annual free cash flow and ended its recent quarter with a net cash position of $57 billion after debt. This strong financial position enabled Apple to return more than $24 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the last quarter alone.

InvestingPro Tips reveal that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is a strong vote of confidence in the company's future. Additionally, the company yields a high return on invested capital, which, combined with strong earnings, allows management to continue dividend payments. In fact, Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, further demonstrating its financial health.

Even though a foreign-exchange headwind led to a 1% year-over-year revenue drop in fiscal Q3, there are promising areas for growth. The services segment, which includes AppleCare, App Store transactions and subscriptions, Apple Pay, and Apple TV+, recorded an 8% YoY growth in the same quarter. Additionally, Apple achieved record revenue in emerging markets like India, indicating potential for further expansion.

With these factors in mind, the company's current valuation of less than 30 times earnings is seen as reasonable ahead of its fiscal Q4 results announcement. InvestingPro's real-time metrics show a P/E Ratio of 29.72, reinforcing this viewpoint. The recent slump in Apple's stock price presents a unique opportunity for investors to acquire shares at a lower cost.

2022-10-19, IANS,"ICEA hails import authorisation amendment for IT hardware, breather for PC makers",https://in.investing.com/news/icea-hails-import-authorisation-amendment-for-it-hardware-breather-for-pc-makers-3857447,"New Delhi, Oct 19 (IANS) The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) on Thursday welcomed the government’s decision to maintain restriction-free imports of laptops and tablets until September 2024.The transition towards the Import Management System, scheduled to initiate from November 1, 2022, is now being meticulously worked upon in collaboration with the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce, to ensure a streamlined adaptation from the current processes.

The announcement comes as a vital support to the industry amid its progressive dialogues with the government to shape import norms, said the ICEA.

""This decision not only addresses immediate industry concerns but also lays a solid foundation for a structured dialogue towards fostering a robust domestic IT hardware manufacturing ecosystem,"" ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said.

The move is a breather for companies like HP, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Dell, Lenovo and others who rely on imports to meet the surge in demand in the country for their PCs, laptops and tablets, especially in the festive season.

Meanwhile, the Centre has asked the PC and laptop companies to share their import data for the last three years, according to industry sources. Last month, PC and laptop makers met the IT Ministry officials to rethink its decision on import licensing requirements accompanied by a quota.

The meeting discussed proposed changes, like linking the import of IT hardware to the local manufacturing of a company value and its export value of electronic items.

Mohindroo emphasised the importance of such policy adjustments in facilitating India's journey towards becoming a self-reliant and globally competitive electronics manufacturing hub.

""The industry is now working with DGFT to ensure a smooth transition from the current process to the Import Management System from November 1,"" he added.

This government aims $300 billion in production for the electronics manufacturing sector by FY26. The recently-introduced Production-Linked Incentive (PLI 2.0) Scheme for IT Hardware has an outlay of about Rs 22,890 crore over the six years.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,"Powell's speech, Netflix, Tesla earnings - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powells-speech-netflix-tesla-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3857185,"Investing.com -- Fed chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the session, while Wall Street indices are set to open lower after bond yields rose to record levels.The earnings season continues in full flow, with Netflix and Tesla in the spotlight after releasing results after Wednesday's close.

1. Powell’s speech in the spotlight

is set to hold the spotlight Thursday, as the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at the Economic Club of New York later in the session, with markets nervous that he may strike a hawkish tone after a series of U.S. data pointed to strength in the economy.

Fed policy makers had recently signaled that the central bank may be close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, as rising yields have done some of their job in cooling the economy by reining in credit.

However, recent data has indicated that the labor market remains strong and inflation sticky, and this prompted New York Federal Reserve president to take a more hawkish stance, stating Wednesday that the Fed will likely keep rates higher for longer for “some time” to rein in inflation toward its 2% target.

The benchmark surged on Wednesday, trading past 4.9% for the first time since 2007.

Another pause on rate hikes for November is nearly fully priced in, according to Investing’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool , but the odds of a December rate hike have jumped to 40% this week from 26% last week.

2. Futures sell off as risk sentiment takes a hit

U.S. stock futures traded lower Thursday, continuing the previous session’s weakness as rising bond yields prompted investors to exit more risky assets.

At 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT), the contract dropped 100 points or 0.3%, fell by 13 points or 0.3%, and dropped by 34 points or 0.2%.

The major indices closed lower Wednesday, weighed by escalating tensions in the Middle East and worries over elevated bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since mid-2007.

Investors have started to become fearful of the possibility of another rate increase in December to round out the year, and all eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he speaks later in the session [see above].

Economic data on deck include weekly , for September and the for October.

There are more earnings to digest during the session [see below], while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the two corporate powerhouses reported results after the close Wednesday.

3. Netflix soars with new subscribers; Tesla disappoints

Netflix’s subscription service was in demand in the third quarter, as the streaming giant shattered expectations for new customers, sending its stock surging over 12% in premarket trading.

The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, boosted by its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts, well above expectations for just over 6 million.

These gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, in the early days of the global pandemic.

Substantial subscriber additions came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.

Netflix also increased subscription prices for some of its streaming plans as it posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with forecasts. Earnings came in at $3.73 per share, ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $3.49.

Tesla, on the other hand, disappointed with its quarterly results as its recent wave of electric vehicle price cuts weighed on margins. Its stock fell over 4% premarket.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the third quarter from 18.7% in the previous quarter.

Tesla delivered 435,000 EVs in the quarter, down from 466,140 in the second quarter, with the company citing upgrades at various factories for the decline in production volumes.

Tesla was also cautious about expanding electric vehicle production capacity, with CEO Elon Musk saying he was worried that higher borrowing costs would prevent potential customers from affording its vehicles despite substantial price cuts.

4. Third-quarter earnings season continues

The quarterly earnings season continues Thursday, with results due from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), telecoms company AT&T (NYSE: ), tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE: ), railroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: ), asset manager Blackstone (NYSE: ) as well as a number of regional banks.

So far, admittedly very early in the season, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Earlier Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier, posted an almost 25% fall in third-quarter net profit as global economic woes hit demand for chips used in applications from cars to cellphones and servers.

Nokia (NYSE: ) announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs in a new cost reduction effort after the Finnish telecom gear manufacturer’s third-quarter sales fell by a fifth, taken down by sales of next-generation 5G equipment.

5. Crude’s recent rally cools

Oil prices fell Thursday, handing back a lot of the previous session’s sharp gains, as markets awaited more developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the outlook for global supply.

By 04:50 ET, the futures traded 1.7% lower at $85.75 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.7% to $89.78 a barrel.

Crude prices climbed about 2% in the previous session on concerns of disruptions to global supplies after Iran called for an oil embargo on Israel over the conflict in Gaza and after the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, reported a larger-than-expected draw.

However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has shown few signs of taking any immediate action on Iran's call, easing worries over potential disruptions.

Prices have also been pressured after a deal was reached between the Venezuelan government and the country's political opposition to ensure fair 2024 elections, potentially allowing the country’s oil flows to reenter the global market after years of sanctions."

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

2022-10-18, Investing.com,Record-Breaking Wealth Increase for US Families Amid Pandemic,https://in.investing.com/news/recordbreaking-wealth-increase-for-us-families-amid-pandemic-93CH-3856302,"The financial resilience of American families has been demonstrated through a record-breaking wealth increase from 2019 to 2022, according to Federal Reserve data. The increase has been driven by rising stock indexes, home prices, and multiple government relief packages, which include pandemic-related payments. The Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances showed a 37% rise in median net worth and a 3% increase in median family income between 2018 and 2021, despite the impact of inflation.

This financial progress was seen across nearly all demographics during the pandemic, characterized by increased savings, reduced credit card balances, and expanded retirement accounts. Early pandemic job losses were mitigated by government relief packages, and further income boosts have been provided by a booming job market with low unemployment and rapid wage growth.

Despite these positive trends, financial disparities among demographics persist. Income inequality has widened as wealthier groups have seen more significant gains. Wealth inequality has been nuanced due to the large share of financial assets held by the rich. This has led to substantial dollar-term wealth increases for wealthier families, while poorer families have seen significant percentage growth.

There was a record-breaking increase in direct stock ownership from 15% in 2019 to 21% in 2022. This trend was likely influenced by the popularity of ""meme stocks"" during the pandemic. Despite slower income gains, Black and Hispanic families experienced substantial net worth percentage gains. Asian families, included for the first time in this report, had the highest median net worth among racial or ethnic groups.

Exiting the pandemic, American families have shown strong financial resilience with solid net worth and growing incomes fueling continued spending into Wednesday. This resilience has sustained a robust economy even amid Federal Reserve interest rate hikes intended to cool it down. This fosters hope for a ""soft landing"" economic scenario where any slowdown is gentle and does not lead to a recession.

The launch of D6RH comes after a ""special rebalance"" of the Nasdaq 100 index due to a breach of weighting restrictions by seven major tech giants. The ETF carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.25%, lower than two of the largest funds in its category: the $8.1 billion iShares Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (CNDX) and the £4.1 billion Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF (EQQQ).

Nasdaq ETFs have gained popularity among investors for their broad coverage of over 3,000 stocks within the Index, predominantly technology and growth companies. This wide coverage allows investors to pursue diverse investment strategies without having to buy each stock separately. Other key benefits include high liquidity from trading on platforms like the New York Stock Exchange and lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds due to their passive management approach.

Industry leaders such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google) significantly contribute to the performance of these indices.

For instance, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) mirrors the Nasdaq-100 Index's portfolio of the largest non-financial companies from sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, and communication services. Other options for investors seeking diversified exposure to the broader U.S. stock market include the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (ASX: ), which tracks the .

Focusing on China, the analysts said: ""While there are catalysts for smartphone demand approaching with the holiday season and Singles' Day in China, the upside for iPhones is somewhat limited considering the macro environment and the competitive landscape with Huawei's Mate60 in China."""

According to data released on Tuesday, Huawei has secured a 19.4% market share for the week of October 2-8, driven by the popularity of its Mate 60 Pro models. This development comes amid an overall market decline of 3%.

The introduction of the Mate 60 Series in September has catalyzed an annual sales surge of 95% for Huawei, starkly contrasting with the broader market trend. Over the preceding three weeks, Huawei's sales growth reached impressive figures of 91%, 46%, and 83% respectively.

On the other hand, Apple's iPhone 15 is underperforming in the Chinese market, with sales figures showing a significant double-digit drop compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 14. This decline is attributed to decreased smartphone demand and increased competition from Huawei's successful Mate 60 Pro. Despite advanced features like a titanium build and A17 Pro chipsets, the iPhone 15 line has been affected by heating issues linked to ""background activity"", as stated by Apple. This problem has led to user discomfort, especially with the iPhone 15 Pro models which have been reported as uncomfortably warm to the touch.

Analysts from Counterpoint Research and Jefferies Group, including Edison Lee, suggest that a shift towards Huawei products is being driven by Chinese consumers' nationalism, stemming from perceived wrongs due to US sanctions.

If these trends continue, forecasts from Jefferies report indicate that Huawei is set to surpass the iPhone by 2024. These developments underline the growing competition in China's smartphone market and highlight the impact of geopolitical factors on consumer preferences.

""Last week, our dashboard showed iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max model availability in the low single-digits across 4 of the 5 geographies we track.

The data, however, is in contrast to early US numbers coming in which reflect robust demand across all models, especially the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

“China’s headline numbers for the 15 series are in the red, and this is a reflection of the broader decline in consumer spending,” said analyst Mengmeng Zhang.

However, the shorter pre-holiday shopping period coupled with supply mismatches on the Pro Max (with consumers shying away from blue) could push some of the demand to calendar Q4, the analyst added.

The reassessment follows a series of difficulties encountered post-launch of the Apple credit card and other lending products. The bank's consumer lending sector problems are exacerbated by operational inefficiencies, including billing process issues, and regulatory scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigating the bank's credit card account management practices.

The partnership with Apple, initiated through a joint savings account, is under review with potential alternatives including an increased role for Apple or transferring consumer products to American Express Co (NYSE: ) AXP. However, discussions with American Express have been stalled by concerns about the Apple Card’s loss rates and its operation on the Mastercard (NYSE: ) network. Further complicating matters, if Goldman is unable to reduce credit card costs, it might consider selling the Apple and General Motors (NYSE: ) partnerships, a challenging undertaking due to billions in deposits in Apple savings accounts.

Monday saw Goldman Sachs contemplating a complete exit from consumer lending products, including those linked to Apple and General Motors' credit card. This consideration is favored by several Goldman executives and may be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report. CEO David Solomon has been criticized for the venture's profitability shortfall.

In recent developments, Goldman Sachs plans to sell GreenSky, a ""buy now, pay later"" company acquired last year at a significant loss, which is expected to negatively impact its Q3 earnings per share by $(0.19). In addition to this, the bank has also divested most of its personal loan portfolio. The decision to sell GreenSky follows substantial losses incurred from Goldman's acquisition and subsequent sale of the company.

As part of an internal shift in strategy, Goldman Sachs is moving resources from consumer lending to Project Blue, an initiative addressing regulatory issues. This move comes amidst increased regulatory scrutiny due to credit card billing errors and refunds, further pressurizing the bank's consumer service. The unique billing cycle of Apple Card bills issued at each month's start has intensified these pressures, with attempts to change this proving unsuccessful.

Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs shares were up by 0.68% to $311.40 in premarket trading on Monday, ahead of an anticipated earnings report.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,Apple and Suppliers’ Shares Dip Amid Weak iPhone 15 Sales in China,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-suppliers-shares-dip-amid-weak-iphone-15-sales-in-china-93CH-3852671,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), along with its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: ), Qorvo (NASDAQ: ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), experienced a slight decline in their share prices on Monday following the release of the iPhone 15 and new versions of the Apple Watch. This drop was attributed to reports from Jefferies and Counterpoint Research, which pointed to potential weaknesses in iPhone 15 sales in China.

According to these reports, sales of the iPhone 15 in China have reduced by a double-digit percentage compared to the first 17 days of iPhone 14 Pro sales. The emerging competition from Huawei's latest smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, is cited as a contributing factor. The Mate 60 Pro is equipped with an in-house chip that enhances 5G performance.

Data from Counterpoint Research, featured in a Bloomberg report, anticipates a 4.5% decline in iPhone 15 sales. Huawei is projected to sell between five to six million units of the Mate 60 Pro this year, with a significant increase to at least ten million units expected next year. Apple has not yet responded to these findings, as reported by Seeking Alpha.

InvestingPro data shows that Apple's market cap is a staggering $2780.0B USD with a P/E ratio of 29.81. Revenue for the last twelve months (LTM2022.Q3) stood at $383.93B USD, although it's worth noting that this represents a slight decline of 0.93% from the previous year. The company's gross profit for the same period was $166.82B USD, indicating a healthy profit margin of 43.45%.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is usually a positive sign of the company's confidence in its future prospects. Additionally, Apple yields a high return on invested capital and its strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. The company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,"Goldman Sachs suffers losses from Apple partnership, plans exit from consumer lending",https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-suffers-losses-from-apple-partnership-plans-exit-from-consumer-lending-93CH-3852511,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: )' foray into consumer lending, marked by its joint ventures with Apple (NASDAQ: ), has led to significant losses and dissatisfaction among its executives. The bank's unsuccessful partnership with Apple on the Apple Card project and a joint savings account has resulted in a $3 billion loss from consumer lending efforts, including a $1 billion loss attributed to the Apple Card project. This was revealed during a town hall meeting on Monday.

In addition to the losses incurred from the Apple partnership, Goldman Sachs also suffered a $1.2 billion loss in 2022 due to high acquisition costs per new user. The bank is now making efforts to divest from this sector, which includes selling off most of its personal loans and its primary consumer lending business, GreenSky, at a loss.

Despite negotiations with credit card company American Express (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs has been unable to offload the troubled Apple Card partnership. Concerns about loss rates and MasterCard's role as the network partner have stalled decisions.

The billing cycle of the Apple Card, which generates all bills on the first day of each month, has been identified as an issue that increases customer service workload. Efforts to change this have been unsuccessful and have been attributed to Apple.

The recently launched joint savings account with Apple attracted high deposit balances within a few months. This development has caused concern among Goldman executives, as separating from Apple might necessitate large last-minute funding.

Adding to Goldman's woes is an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into the bank's failure to promptly address errors and refund cardholders. The bank blames Apple for this issue.

An exit strategy suggested by some within Goldman Sachs involves Apple lending its own money for new credit card issuance while the bank manages existing loans. However, this proposal lacks traction within both corporations.

During a July earnings call, Goldman Sachs CEO acknowledged the need to improve credit-card partnerships. Liz Martin, head of Enterprise Partnerships at Goldman Sachs, expressed satisfaction with the Savings account and focus on providing valuable products to Apple Card customers.

According to InvestingPro Tips, Goldman Sachs has been a prominent player in the Capital Markets industry and has maintained dividend payments for 25 consecutive years. The bank's management has also been aggressively buying back shares.

InvestingPro data shows that Goldman Sachs has a market cap of 107.33B USD and a P/E ratio of 13.25. Despite the challenges with the Apple Card project, the bank's revenue stands at 43.76B USD, and its gross profit margin is at a robust 83.02%. The bank also has a healthy dividend yield of 3.56%.

Apple, according to InvestingPro Tips, is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. The company has been consistently profitable over the last twelve months and has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years. The management of Apple has been aggressively buying back shares, which is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance.

InvestingPro data reveals that Apple has a massive market cap of 2780.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 29.72. The company's revenue stands at 383.93B USD, and its gross profit margin is at 43.45%. Apple has a dividend yield of 0.54% and has seen a 1 month price total return of 2.19%.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: ) experienced a rally, with increases of 0.3% and nearly 2% respectively.

The standout performer was PCTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: ), which spiked over 47% following an announcement that it would be acquired by Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:NYSE: ). The all-cash transaction is valued at $139.7 million, a factor that contributed significantly to the surge in PCTEL's stock price.

In contrast, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) faced challenges in the Chinese market as its iPhone 15 sales underperformed due to weak demand and stiff competition from local tech giant Huawei. This led to a pre-bell share drop of 0.6% for the Cupertino-based company.

Despite previous losses and a recent non-compliance notice, Maris-Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:MTEK) managed to buck the trend with a rally of 3%. The exact reasons behind this rally are not specified in the provided context, but this development indicates an unexpected positive investor sentiment towards the company.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,"Goldman Sachs Reconsiders Consumer Lending, Mulls Over Apple Partnership Termination",https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-reconsiders-consumer-lending-mulls-over-apple-partnership-termination-93CH-3852369,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is reassessing its consumer lending strategy following significant losses and internal criticism, as it contemplates ending its partnership with tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ). The joint venture, which includes a savings account launched in April and an Apple credit card service, has been fraught with issues leading to a reported $1.2 billion loss in 2022.

The bank's internal review comes in the wake of the decision to retreat from consumer lending, selling GreenSky at a loss and offloading most of its personal loan portfolio. The move could signal the end of Goldman's venture into consumer lending. The bank's upcoming earnings report, scheduled for Tuesday, is anticipated to reveal a sharp drop in profits. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is expected to reassure investors by emphasizing a refocus on core Wall Street operations.

The Apple savings account, despite initial skepticism, managed to attract billions in deposits swiftly, causing concern among some Goldman executives due to high balances that could complicate a potential separation from Apple. If the partnership were to move to another bank, Goldman might need to raise expensive last-minute funding.

Meanwhile, discussions about Apple assuming more responsibility in the partnership have been taking place. These include proposals for Apple to become the lender for new credit-card spending and issuance while Goldman manages existing loans. However, this proposal has officially been denied as being under discussion.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently investigating Goldman’s credit card account management practices, including how the bank resolves billing errors and refunds cardholders. This investigation has added strain on customer service resources already overwhelmed by dispatching millions of electronic invoices simultaneously.

Bill Johnson, a Citigroup (NYSE: ) credit-card veteran hired in August, has been given the task of making credit-card partnerships profitable. If this proves unachievable or requires additional credit-card programs, Goldman might consider selling its card partnerships with Apple and General Motors (NYSE: ).

Goldman's consumer lending experiment has not been without its critics. Internal partners blame CEO Solomon for the ill-fated expansion into consumer lending. The unit that includes credit cards and GreenSky has reportedly lost billions, leading to regulatory scrutiny and causing many top executives to leave or move to other units.

The future of Goldman's consumer lending experiment and its partnership with Apple remains uncertain. More details are expected to be revealed during Goldman Sachs' earnings call on Tuesday.

2022-10-16, IANS,Apple leads tech giants in pushing suppliers to adopt clean energy,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-leads-tech-giants-in-pushing-suppliers-to-adopt-clean-energy-3852163,"New Delhi, Oct 16 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) leads the pack of six tech giants who have set targets for its suppliers to switch to renewable energy and among those top IT brands, it is the only company that has a 100 per cent renewable electricity target in its supply chain, a new report has revealed.The global climate crisis has intensified the urgency for the information technology (IT) sector to initiate substantive actions to decarbonise. Currently, the sector contributes to 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

The report by nonprofit organisation, named Stand.earth, compared climate initiatives by Apple, Dell, Google (NASDAQ: ), HP, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia.

“All six brands have made clear plans on the use of renewable energy in self-operated stores and facilities. Among them, Apple has generated or sourced enough renewable electricity to match 100 percent of electricity demand for its corporate operations since 2018,” the findings showed.

According to a recent report by Apple, more than 300 manufacturers have committed to using 100 per cent clean energy for Apple production by 2030 as of September 2022, contributing to Apple’s goal to be carbon neutral across every product by the end of the decade.

“Other brands need to send similarly clear signals to their suppliers,” said Gary Cook, global climate policy director for Stand.earth.

As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritising clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials.

Among the six brands, Apple, Dell, HP, and Google have disclosed information regarding the procurement of renewable energy within their supply chains, each to varying extents.

In a recently released ‘Sustainable Impact Report’, HP disclosed 100 per cent of tier 1 suppliers’ energy use and the percentage of renewable energy used in HP’s production from 2019 to 2021.

To accelerate corporate clean energy sourcing and decarbonise electrical grids, Apple and Google have reported joining the Asia Clean Energy Coalition.

“By setting clear climate targets and engaging with suppliers, Apple and HP have shown a downward trend in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relating to purchased products and services. Despite setting supply chain decarbonization targets, Microsoft and Dell had significant increases in emissions relating to purchased products and services,” the report emphasised.

Among the six brands, Google has not separately published annual GHG data relating to purchased products and services, it added.

While the IT industry has acknowledged the necessity of supply chain decarbonisation, as evidenced by making commitments and taking some commendable measures, brands need to take more proactive steps to ensure that they are on track to meet their decarbonisation goals.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

2022-10-18, Investing.com,Record-Breaking Wealth Increase for US Families Amid Pandemic,https://in.investing.com/news/recordbreaking-wealth-increase-for-us-families-amid-pandemic-93CH-3856302,"The financial resilience of American families has been demonstrated through a record-breaking wealth increase from 2019 to 2022, according to Federal Reserve data. The increase has been driven by rising stock indexes, home prices, and multiple government relief packages, which include pandemic-related payments. The Fed's Survey of Consumer Finances showed a 37% rise in median net worth and a 3% increase in median family income between 2018 and 2021, despite the impact of inflation.

This financial progress was seen across nearly all demographics during the pandemic, characterized by increased savings, reduced credit card balances, and expanded retirement accounts. Early pandemic job losses were mitigated by government relief packages, and further income boosts have been provided by a booming job market with low unemployment and rapid wage growth.

Despite these positive trends, financial disparities among demographics persist. Income inequality has widened as wealthier groups have seen more significant gains. Wealth inequality has been nuanced due to the large share of financial assets held by the rich. This has led to substantial dollar-term wealth increases for wealthier families, while poorer families have seen significant percentage growth.

There was a record-breaking increase in direct stock ownership from 15% in 2019 to 21% in 2022. This trend was likely influenced by the popularity of ""meme stocks"" during the pandemic. Despite slower income gains, Black and Hispanic families experienced substantial net worth percentage gains. Asian families, included for the first time in this report, had the highest median net worth among racial or ethnic groups.

Exiting the pandemic, American families have shown strong financial resilience with solid net worth and growing incomes fueling continued spending into Wednesday. This resilience has sustained a robust economy even amid Federal Reserve interest rate hikes intended to cool it down. This fosters hope for a ""soft landing"" economic scenario where any slowdown is gentle and does not lead to a recession.

The launch of D6RH comes after a ""special rebalance"" of the Nasdaq 100 index due to a breach of weighting restrictions by seven major tech giants. The ETF carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.25%, lower than two of the largest funds in its category: the $8.1 billion iShares Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (CNDX) and the £4.1 billion Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF (EQQQ). This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking cost-effective exposure to the high-performing tech sector.

Nasdaq ETFs have gained popularity among investors for their broad coverage of over 3,000 stocks within the Index, predominantly technology and growth companies. This wide coverage allows investors to pursue diverse investment strategies without having to buy each stock separately. Other key benefits include high liquidity from trading on platforms like the New York Stock Exchange and lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds due to their passive management approach.

The focus on the technology sector by these ETFs provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the sector's growth. Industry leaders such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google) significantly contribute to the performance of these indices.

ETFs offer a route for investors to gain exposure to the innovative, tech-dominant Nasdaq exchange and potential high returns. For instance, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) mirrors the Nasdaq-100 Index's portfolio of the largest non-financial companies from sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, and communication services. Other options for investors seeking diversified exposure to the broader U.S. stock market include the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (ASX: ), which tracks the .

The analysts, who have a Neutral rating and $190 per share price target on Apple shares, told investors that the firm's Evidence Lab data, which tracks iPhone availability across 30 countries, shows wait times have contracted by an average of 5 days YoY amongst the US, China, Europe, and Japan for the iPhone 15 Pro.

According to data released on Tuesday, Huawei has secured a 19.4% market share for the week of October 2-8, driven by the popularity of its Mate 60 Pro models. This development comes amid an overall market decline of 3%.

On the other hand, Apple's iPhone 15 is underperforming in the Chinese market, with sales figures showing a significant double-digit drop compared to its predecessor, the iPhone 14. This decline is attributed to decreased smartphone demand and increased competition from Huawei's successful Mate 60 Pro. Despite advanced features like a titanium build and A17 Pro chipsets, the iPhone 15 line has been affected by heating issues linked to ""background activity"", as stated by Apple. This problem has led to user discomfort, especially with the iPhone 15 Pro models which have been reported as uncomfortably warm to the touch.

Analysts from Counterpoint Research and Jefferies Group, including Edison Lee, suggest that a shift towards Huawei products is being driven by Chinese consumers' nationalism, stemming from perceived wrongs due to US sanctions.

If these trends continue, forecasts from Jefferies report indicate that Huawei is set to surpass the iPhone by 2024. These developments underline the growing competition in China's smartphone market and highlight the impact of geopolitical factors on consumer preferences.

Meanwhile, the other four geographies the investment bank tracks — the US, Canada, China, and Asia excluding China — all saw improvements to the 20-30% availability range.

""We think the data indicates a better supply environment where supply is catching up to demand,"" the analysts added. They also noted that the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus availability is also improving, while iPhone 14 and older models are showing availability increases.

""We also looked into the iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Plus models, which saw increasing availability over the last week. 4 of the 5 geographies we track saw 25 to 40 point increases in availability while Europe saw the smallest increase of only 12 points (26% to 38%),"" the analysts said.

2022-10-17, IANS,iPhone 15 series sales in China down 4.5% compared to iPhone 14: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-15-series-sales-in-china-down-45-compared-to-iphone-14-report-3853193,"Hong Kong, Oct 17 (IANS) The iPhone 15 series unit sales for the first 17 days in China is underperforming last year’s iPhone 14, a reflection of the broader decline in consumer spending, a report showed on Tuesday.Excluding the iPhone Plus model, which was released three weeks late last year, sales declines exceeded 10 per cent in China, according to preliminary data from Counterpoint Research.

The data, however, is in contrast to early US numbers coming in which reflect robust demand across all models, especially the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

“China’s headline numbers for the 15 series are in the red, and this is a reflection of the broader decline in consumer spending,” said analyst Mengmeng Zhang.

However, the shorter pre-holiday shopping period coupled with supply mismatches on the Pro Max (with consumers shying away from blue) could push some of the demand to calendar Q4, the analyst added.

Early US numbers are in stark contrast to China, with the first nine days of iPhone 15 sales showing double-digit increases in overall unit sales and healthy demand across Base, Pro and especially Pro Max models.

“The US is hot right now with back-to-back stellar weekends for the new iPhone. Overall reception of the 15 series has been very positive and we’re expecting a major upgrade cycle from iPhone 11 and 12 users,” said Jeff Fieldhack, Research Director for North America.

“Of course, we’re talking about the first couple weeks of sales, but it’s a positive sign and takes a lot of sting off the China numbers,” Fieldhack added.

The smartphone volumes declined YoY largely due to slower than expected recovery in consumer demand, according to Counterpoint Research.

However, the market’s quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) growth (2 per cent), especially the positive performance in September despite one full week less of sales of the new iPhones, is likely a sign of positive news ahead, the report mentioned.

Samsung (KS: ) continued to lead the global market, capturing a fifth of the total sales in Q3.

The new generation of foldables received a mixed response, with the Flip 5 outselling its counterpart by nearly twice as much.

However, Samsung’s A-series models remained market leaders in mid-price bands.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) came in second with a 16 per cent market share despite the limited availability of iPhone 15 series, which has been received well so far, the report said.

Xiaomi, OPPO and vivo rounded off the top five, with the three recording YoY declines.

In Q3, all these brands worked towards strengthening their positions in key markets like China and India, while continuing to slow down expansionary efforts in overseas markets.

HONOR, Huawei and Transsion Group gained share and were among the only brands to record YoY growth in Q3, according to the report.

“Following a strong September, we expect the momentum to continue till the year-end, beginning with the full impact of the iPhone 15 series along with the arrival of the festive season in India, followed by the 11.11 sales event in China and ending with the Christmas and end-of-year promotions,” the report mentioned.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs reassesses consumer lending venture amid operational challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-reassesses-consumer-lending-venture-amid-operational-challenges-93CH-3852824,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ) is reconsidering its position in the consumer lending sector, including its partnership with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), due to internal disagreements and operational hurdles. The reassessment follows a series of difficulties encountered post-launch of the Apple credit card and other lending products. The bank's consumer lending sector problems are exacerbated by operational inefficiencies, including billing process issues, and regulatory scrutiny from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigating the bank's credit card account management practices.

The partnership with Apple, initiated through a joint savings account, is under review with potential alternatives including an increased role for Apple or transferring consumer products to American Express Co (NYSE: ) AXP. However, discussions with American Express have been stalled by concerns about the Apple Card’s loss rates and its operation on the Mastercard (NYSE: ) network. Further complicating matters, if Goldman is unable to reduce credit card costs, it might consider selling the Apple and General Motors (NYSE: ) partnerships, a challenging undertaking due to billions in deposits in Apple savings accounts.

Monday saw Goldman Sachs contemplating a complete exit from consumer lending products, including those linked to Apple and General Motors' credit card. This consideration is favored by several Goldman executives and may be reflected in the upcoming quarterly earnings report. CEO David Solomon has been criticized for the venture's profitability shortfall.

In recent developments, Goldman Sachs plans to sell GreenSky, a ""buy now, pay later"" company acquired last year at a significant loss, which is expected to negatively impact its Q3 earnings per share by $(0.19). In addition to this, the bank has also divested most of its personal loan portfolio. The decision to sell GreenSky follows substantial losses incurred from Goldman's acquisition and subsequent sale of the company.

As part of an internal shift in strategy, Goldman Sachs is moving resources from consumer lending to Project Blue, an initiative addressing regulatory issues. This move comes amidst increased regulatory scrutiny due to credit card billing errors and refunds, further pressurizing the bank's consumer service. The unique billing cycle of Apple Card bills issued at each month's start has intensified these pressures, with attempts to change this proving unsuccessful.

Despite these challenges, Goldman Sachs shares were up by 0.68% to $311.40 in premarket trading on Monday, ahead of an anticipated earnings report.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,Apple and Suppliers’ Shares Dip Amid Weak iPhone 15 Sales in China,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-suppliers-shares-dip-amid-weak-iphone-15-sales-in-china-93CH-3852671,"Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ), along with its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: ), Qorvo (NASDAQ: ), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), experienced a slight decline in their share prices on Monday following the release of the iPhone 15 and new versions of the Apple Watch. This drop was attributed to reports from Jefferies and Counterpoint Research, which pointed to potential weaknesses in iPhone 15 sales in China.

According to these reports, sales of the iPhone 15 in China have reduced by a double-digit percentage compared to the first 17 days of iPhone 14 Pro sales. The emerging competition from Huawei's latest smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, is cited as a contributing factor. The Mate 60 Pro is equipped with an in-house chip that enhances 5G performance.

Data from Counterpoint Research, featured in a Bloomberg report, anticipates a 4.5% decline in iPhone 15 sales. Huawei is projected to sell between five to six million units of the Mate 60 Pro this year, with a significant increase to at least ten million units expected next year. Apple has not yet responded to these findings, as reported by Seeking Alpha.

InvestingPro data shows that Apple's market cap is a staggering $2780.0B USD with a P/E ratio of 29.81. Revenue for the last twelve months (LTM2022.Q3) stood at $383.93B USD, although it's worth noting that this represents a slight decline of 0.93% from the previous year. The company's gross profit for the same period was $166.82B USD, indicating a healthy profit margin of 43.45%.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that Apple's management has been aggressively buying back shares, which is usually a positive sign of the company's confidence in its future prospects. Additionally, Apple yields a high return on invested capital and its strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. The company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years.

Despite the downward trend in iPhone 15 sales and Huawei's growing market presence, Jeffries analyst Andrew Uerkwitz maintains a Buy rating for Apple with a $220 price target. The analyst consensus rates Apple as a Moderate Buy, with an average AAPL price target of $207.69. This represents a potential upside of 16.1%, based on the current consensus of 20 Buys and nine Holds.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,"Goldman Sachs suffers losses from Apple partnership, plans exit from consumer lending",https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-suffers-losses-from-apple-partnership-plans-exit-from-consumer-lending-93CH-3852511,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: )' foray into consumer lending, marked by its joint ventures with Apple (NASDAQ: ), has led to significant losses and dissatisfaction among its executives. The bank's unsuccessful partnership with Apple on the Apple Card project and a joint savings account has resulted in a $3 billion loss from consumer lending efforts, including a $1 billion loss attributed to the Apple Card project. This was revealed during a town hall meeting on Monday.

In addition to the losses incurred from the Apple partnership, Goldman Sachs also suffered a $1.2 billion loss in 2022 due to high acquisition costs per new user. The bank is now making efforts to divest from this sector, which includes selling off most of its personal loans and its primary consumer lending business, GreenSky, at a loss.

Despite negotiations with credit card company American Express (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs has been unable to offload the troubled Apple Card partnership. Concerns about loss rates and MasterCard's role as the network partner have stalled decisions.

The billing cycle of the Apple Card, which generates all bills on the first day of each month, has been identified as an issue that increases customer service workload. Efforts to change this have been unsuccessful and have been attributed to Apple.

The recently launched joint savings account with Apple attracted high deposit balances within a few months. This development has caused concern among Goldman executives, as separating from Apple might necessitate large last-minute funding.

Adding to Goldman's woes is an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau into the bank's failure to promptly address errors and refund cardholders. The bank blames Apple for this issue.

An exit strategy suggested by some within Goldman Sachs involves Apple lending its own money for new credit card issuance while the bank manages existing loans. However, this proposal lacks traction within both corporations.

During a July earnings call, Goldman Sachs CEO acknowledged the need to improve credit-card partnerships. Liz Martin, head of Enterprise Partnerships at Goldman Sachs, expressed satisfaction with the Savings account and focus on providing valuable products to Apple Card customers.

According to InvestingPro Tips, Goldman Sachs has been a prominent player in the Capital Markets industry and has maintained dividend payments for 25 consecutive years. The bank's management has also been aggressively buying back shares.

InvestingPro data shows that Goldman Sachs has a market cap of 107.33B USD and a P/E ratio of 13.25. Despite the challenges with the Apple Card project, the bank's revenue stands at 43.76B USD, and its gross profit margin is at a robust 83.02%. The bank also has a healthy dividend yield of 3.56%.

Apple, according to InvestingPro Tips, is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. The company has been consistently profitable over the last twelve months and has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years. The management of Apple has been aggressively buying back shares, which is a strong indicator of the company's confidence in its future performance.

InvestingPro data reveals that Apple has a massive market cap of 2780.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 29.72. The company's revenue stands at 383.93B USD, and its gross profit margin is at 43.45%. Apple has a dividend yield of 0.54% and has seen a 1 month price total return of 2.19%.

The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: ) experienced a rally, with increases of 0.3% and nearly 2% respectively.

The standout performer was PCTEL Inc. (NASDAQ: ), which spiked over 47% following an announcement that it would be acquired by Amphenol Corporation (NYSE:NYSE: ). The all-cash transaction is valued at $139.7 million, a factor that contributed significantly to the surge in PCTEL's stock price.

In contrast, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) faced challenges in the Chinese market as its iPhone 15 sales underperformed due to weak demand and stiff competition from local tech giant Huawei. This led to a pre-bell share drop of 0.6% for the Cupertino-based company.

Despite previous losses and a recent non-compliance notice, Maris-Tech Ltd. (NASDAQ:MTEK) managed to buck the trend with a rally of 3%.

The joint venture, which includes a savings account launched in April and an Apple credit card service, has been fraught with issues leading to a reported $1.2 billion loss in 2022.

The bank's internal review comes in the wake of the decision to retreat from consumer lending, selling GreenSky at a loss and offloading most of its personal loan portfolio. The move could signal the end of Goldman's venture into consumer lending. The bank's upcoming earnings report, scheduled for Tuesday, is anticipated to reveal a sharp drop in profits. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon is expected to reassure investors by emphasizing a refocus on core Wall Street operations.

The Apple savings account, despite initial skepticism, managed to attract billions in deposits swiftly, causing concern among some Goldman executives due to high balances that could complicate a potential separation from Apple. If the partnership were to move to another bank, Goldman might need to raise expensive last-minute funding.

Meanwhile, discussions about Apple assuming more responsibility in the partnership have been taking place. These include proposals for Apple to become the lender for new credit-card spending and issuance while Goldman manages existing loans. However, this proposal has officially been denied as being under discussion.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is currently investigating Goldman’s credit card account management practices, including how the bank resolves billing errors and refunds cardholders. This investigation has added strain on customer service resources already overwhelmed by dispatching millions of electronic invoices simultaneously.

Bill Johnson, a Citigroup (NYSE: ) credit-card veteran hired in August, has been given the task of making credit-card partnerships profitable. If this proves unachievable or requires additional credit-card programs, Goldman might consider selling its card partnerships with Apple and General Motors (NYSE: ).

Goldman's consumer lending experiment has not been without its critics. Internal partners blame CEO Solomon for the ill-fated expansion into consumer lending. The unit that includes credit cards and GreenSky has reportedly lost billions, leading to regulatory scrutiny and causing many top executives to leave or move to other units.

The future of Goldman's consumer lending experiment and its partnership with Apple remains uncertain. More details are expected to be revealed during Goldman Sachs' earnings call on Tuesday.

2022-10-16, IANS,Apple leads tech giants in pushing suppliers to adopt clean energy,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-leads-tech-giants-in-pushing-suppliers-to-adopt-clean-energy-3852163,"New Delhi, Oct 16 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) leads the pack of six tech giants who have set targets for its suppliers to switch to renewable energy and among those top IT brands, it is the only company that has a 100 per cent renewable electricity target in its supply chain, a new report has revealed.The global climate crisis has intensified the urgency for the information technology (IT) sector to initiate substantive actions to decarbonise. Currently, the sector contributes to 4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

The report by nonprofit organisation, named Stand.earth, compared climate initiatives by Apple, Dell, Google (NASDAQ: ), HP, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia.

“All six brands have made clear plans on the use of renewable energy in self-operated stores and facilities. Among them, Apple has generated or sourced enough renewable electricity to match 100 percent of electricity demand for its corporate operations since 2018,” the findings showed.

According to a recent report by Apple, more than 300 manufacturers have committed to using 100 per cent clean energy for Apple production by 2030 as of September 2022, contributing to Apple’s goal to be carbon neutral across every product by the end of the decade.

“Other brands need to send similarly clear signals to their suppliers,” said Gary Cook, global climate policy director for Stand.earth.

As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritising clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials.

Among the six brands, Apple, Dell, HP, and Google have disclosed information regarding the procurement of renewable energy within their supply chains, each to varying extents.

In a recently released ‘Sustainable Impact Report’, HP disclosed 100 per cent of tier 1 suppliers’ energy use and the percentage of renewable energy used in HP’s production from 2019 to 2021.

To accelerate corporate clean energy sourcing and decarbonise electrical grids, Apple and Google have reported joining the Asia Clean Energy Coalition.

“By setting clear climate targets and engaging with suppliers, Apple and HP have shown a downward trend in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relating to purchased products and services. Despite setting supply chain decarbonization targets, Microsoft and Dell had significant increases in emissions relating to purchased products and services,” the report emphasised.

Among the six brands, Google has not separately published annual GHG data relating to purchased products and services, it added.

While the IT industry has acknowledged the necessity of supply chain decarbonisation, as evidenced by making commitments and taking some commendable measures, brands need to take more proactive steps to ensure that they are on track to meet their decarbonisation goals.

""However, we are now more guarded on the December quarter (F1Q24) than our prior forecast implied - not because of worsening demand data points - but because supply (both labor and component) remains a headwind that is resulting in a pushout of iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max demand from the December '23 quarter to the March '24 quarter,"" they added.

The firm doesn't see Apple's upcoming earnings release on November 2 as a material stock catalyst.

Analysts also noted that there has been no change to overall iPhone builds from the supply chain, but limited iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max supply is resulting in a pushout of 7M iPhone builds from December to early 2024."

2022-10-16, IANS,Apple likely to update iPad lineup with enhanced chips this week,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-likely-to-update-ipad-lineup-with-enhanced-chips-this-week-3851056,"San Francisco, Oct 16 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is likely to announce updated versions of its iPad lineup this week with top-of-the-line silicon chips and other internal upgrades.The iPad Air, iPad mini and the base model iPad are expected to be refreshed and the company is expected to update specifications rather than significant design changes, reports 9to5Mac.

“Updates for iPad Air and iPad mini are indeed due, so the timing makes sense. This October refresh will update the tablets with newer-generation Apple Silicon chips,” the report mentioned.

The iPad Air and the iPad mini will be bumped to M2 and A16 Bionic chips, respectively, according to the report.

The next-gen iPad Pros are expected to feature OLED displays for the first time.

Apple refreshed the iPad Air (with M1 chip) and 10th-generation iPad last year.

""The new iPad mini should sport an A16 Bionic chip, offering a small improvement over its current A15 Bionic chip,"" the report mentioned.

According to earlier reports, new iPad mini will feature a new display controller to address the impact of the jelly scrolling issue.

The base model iPad was last updated a year ago. The 10th-generation model brought a new thin bezel design, new colours and a Touch ID side button.

It is currently powered by the A14 Bionic chip. The iPad Pro lineup will stay the same.

2022-10-14, IANS,Mild recovery not enough; manufacturing needs to grow faster to create jobs,https://in.investing.com/news/mild-recovery-not-enough-manufacturing-needs-to-grow-faster-to-create-jobs-3850303,"New Delhi, Oct 14 (IANS) India’s manufacturing sector staged a mild recovery in the last quarter of 2022-23, after half a year of contraction, and continued to expand at a moderate pace with a 4.7% growth in the first quarter of the current financial year.Official figures released on Thursday show a 9.3% growth in the manufacturing sector during August but this is compared to a low base of the previous year when output contracted.

Since the manufacturing sector holds the key to providing quality jobs to the country’s young graduates passing out of engineering institutes and universities, it needs to grow at a much faster and steadier pace.

The Government’s National Manufacturing Policy has set an ambitious target to increase the share of manufacturing in the country’s GDP to 25 percent by 2025 from around 17 percent at present.

The productivity linked incentive (PLI) scheme for a big push to manufacturing, launched in 2022 with an allocation of Rs 1.97 lakh crore, has produced some good results but not gone far enough.

The PLI scheme has succeeded in industries such as mobile phone manufacturing with companies such as US tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Taiwan-headquartered multinational company Foxconn setting up manufacturing facilities in the country and giving a major fillip to exports as well. Pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and food processing industries are other areas that have done well.

However, the PLI scheme has not produced the desired results in other segments such as the manufacture of solar PV modules, and electric vehicles.

Another positive outcome has been that India has become an increasingly attractive location for multinationals across a wide range of industries, with foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows touching a record high of USD 85 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal year, according to the RBI. With global players looking to set up supply chains outside China, India’s large domestic market provides an ideal alternative.

Major investments such as the Airbus-Tata joint venture to manufacture military planes in Vadodra has also taken off this year. Similarly, work is on to set up a factory to produce semiconductors by US chip giant Micron (NASDAQ: ) Technologies near Ahmedabad.

However, slowing global growth which is dragging down exports, geopolitical risks and volatile global financial conditions weigh heavily on the outlook ahead for the manufacturing sector.

India has retained its position as the fastest growing large economy ahead of China in the IMF’s latest forecast on economic growth rates. However, according to a report by Barclays (LON: ), India needs to grow at 8% for some years in order to overtake China in terms of contribution to the global economy.This is because China’s GDP is $17.7 trillion which is about five times that of India.

India’s growth has also been largely driven by the services sector which contributes as much as 55% to the country’s GDP with the manufacturing sector’s share at around 17%.

The government’s jobs data showed that since 2018-19, the last pre-pandemic year, and 2022-23, a part of the labour force has gone back to agriculture. In 2022-23, agriculture’s share of the workforce was 45.8%, over three percentage points more than 2018-19. The change in composition was partly on account of a modest decline in the workforce engaged by the manufacturing sector. In 2022-23, only 11.4% of the country’s workforce was in manufacturing.

The Barclays report points out that, India needs to invest more investments in traditional sectors such as mining and power utilities to surpass China as the biggest contributor to world GDP.

Investments in those sectors have taken a back seat in recent years compared to newer industries, such as telecommunications and the digital sector, Rahul Bajoria, a senior economist at Barclays, wrote in the report.

More investment, especially in traditional sectors, should also have a positive impact on employment and household income, and this could help policy makers to formulate better policies for economic growth, he added.

2022-10-13, Investing.com,Microsoft's Activision acquisition underscores Big Tech's vertical growth strategy,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-activision-acquisition-underscores-big-techs-vertical-growth-strategy-93CH-3849745,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) underlines the trend of Big Tech companies expanding through vertical transactions, a strategy also adopted by Meta (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ). This comes despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department to curtail such deals, with courts often expressing skepticism towards their arguments.

The FTC continues to contest Microsoft's acquisition, voicing concerns that it could lead to the tech giant dominating the game streaming market. As part of the deal, Microsoft has pledged to make one of Activision’s major game franchises available to other consoles for a decade in an effort to alleviate competition concerns.

This presumption in favor of vertical transactions has been entrenched since the late 1970s. However, President Biden’s top antitrust officials, FTC chair Lina Khan and Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter, have been actively challenging vertical mergers since their appointments in 2021.

In 2017, marking its first attempt to halt a vertical deal in decades, the Justice Department sought to block the $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (NYSE: ) and Time Warner. Despite these initiatives, judges frequently dismiss these challenges due to a perceived lack of evidence.

Microsoft also arrived at a settlement with the European Union, vowing to make Activision titles accessible to competitors in the emerging market for game streaming. This follows unsuccessful attempts by Khan's FTC in 2021 to prevent Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s acquisition of Arm and Lockheed Martin’s $4.4 billion purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ). The Justice Department's lawsuit against UnitedHealth (NYSE: ) Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: ) was similarly dismissed.

This anticipated recovery is linked to easing inflation and the debut of innovative products, such as Apple (NASDAQ: )'s MacBook using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 3nm fabrication process.

The MacBook, set for a 2024 launch, will feature the M3 chip, marking an advancement from the M2 chip that was launched in June 2022. The M3 chip is expected to enhance performance and power efficiency and could potentially feature a new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, similar to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro.

However, DigiTimes also predicts a decrease in notebooks using Arm-based processors in 2022 due to Apple's planned reduction in shipments. This transition aims at replacing these processors with CPUs manufactured by a 3nm node at TSMC for enhanced performance.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggests that the first Macs with the M3 chip could be unveiled this October. However, Dexerto indicates that M3 MacBooks are not expected until sometime in 2024. The M3 chip will likely feature in the newly launched models such as the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro models, and potentially the upcoming iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.

They argue that ""transformational AI growth and stabilizing IT spending environment will create a massive tech rally heading into year-end in which we expect tech stocks to be up another 12%-15% in 4Q.""

Despite the perplexing macroeconomic and bond market conditions, compounded by the disconcerting geopolitical aftermath of the recent terrorist attack in Israel, the analysts maintain their conviction that the technology sector is robust and well-prepared for a forthcoming earnings season that will defy the skeptics.

The analysts said they are using the macro and Fed worries as a time to ""double down on our bullish tech thesis....and NOT panic.""

They see tech stocks poised for robust growth, driven by AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and a digital ad rebound, overlooked by the market. Further, they anticipate 2024 Fed rate cuts, relieving the yield obsession, with a projected soft landing.

They are focused on generational AI growth and $1 trillion of tech spending over the next decade.

The analysts' favorite tech names remain Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto (NASDAQ: ), Palantir (NYSE: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ), and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ).

They added that the AI cycle will have a profound effect on the consumer Internet, commencing with cloud service divisions like Amazon's AWS and Alphabet's GCP.

This move marks a significant leap from the first-generation N3B technology used in the A17 Pro chip for the current iPhone 15 Pro models.

The adoption of the N3E process is expected to enhance chip performance and power consumption across the new iPhone range. The process will be adopted by all major chip vendors, with the exception of Samsung (KS: ), starting from 2024.

With Intel (NASDAQ: ) experiencing delays in its CPU platform design plans, Apple is projected to utilize all of TSMC's 3nm production capacity at its Taiwanese pure-play foundry. This move could contribute up to $3.4 billion in sales or constitute 4-6% of TSMC's overall sales in 2022.

In addition to Apple's commitment, TSMC has plans to advance N3P to volume production by late 2024. This offers a 1.04x increase in chip density, a speed increase of 5%, and a reduction in power usage between 5-10% over the N3E process.

The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature a faster 5G modem, Wi-Fi 7, and a new 48MP sensor for the ultrawide lens. Major chipmakers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), MediaTek, and AMD are also anticipated to commission N3E circuitry from TSMC for their advanced chips.

He said the government ""only wants importers to be on close watch.""

The government said that the import licensing regime, announced on August 3, was meant to ""ensure trusted hardware and systems"" enter India which was an oblique reference to Chinese goods.

However, introduction of the new licence system was delayed by three months after objections from industry and criticism from the US, which is India’s largest trading partner.

The restrictions would have hit sales of US companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Dell, HP, and Korean electronics giant Samsung (KS: ) among others.

The government is holding consultations with industry and a new order on laptop imports will be announced by the end of October, Directorate General of Foreign Trade Santosh Kumar Sarangi said.

Counterpoint projects Huawei could sell 5 to 6 million units of the Mate 60 Pro alone this year, numbers that could hit double-digits in 2024.

Huawei has now taken the top spot in the market from Apple, Jefferies wrote in a note.

“The trend suggests iPhone would lose to Huawei in 2024,” analysts wrote in a note.

“We believe weak demand in China would eventually lead to lower-than-expected global shipments of iPhone.”"

“Updates for iPad Air and iPad mini are indeed due, so the timing makes sense. This October refresh will update the tablets with newer-generation Apple Silicon chips,” the report mentioned.

The iPad Air and the iPad mini will be bumped to M2 and A16 Bionic chips, respectively, according to the report.

The next-gen iPad Pros are expected to feature OLED displays for the first time.

Apple refreshed the iPad Air (with M1 chip) and 10th-generation iPad last year.

""The new iPad mini should sport an A16 Bionic chip, offering a small improvement over its current A15 Bionic chip,"" the report mentioned.

According to earlier reports, new iPad mini will feature a new display controller to address the impact of the jelly scrolling issue.

The base model iPad was last updated a year ago. The 10th-generation model brought a new thin bezel design, new colours and a Touch ID side button.

It is currently powered by the A14 Bionic chip. The iPad Pro lineup will stay the same.

2022-10-14, IANS,Mild recovery not enough; manufacturing needs to grow faster to create jobs,https://in.investing.com/news/mild-recovery-not-enough-manufacturing-needs-to-grow-faster-to-create-jobs-3850303,"New Delhi, Oct 14 (IANS) India’s manufacturing sector staged a mild recovery in the last quarter of 2022-23, after half a year of contraction, and continued to expand at a moderate pace with a 4.7% growth in the first quarter of the current financial year.Official figures released on Thursday show a 9.3% growth in the manufacturing sector during August but this is compared to a low base of the previous year when output contracted.

Since the manufacturing sector holds the key to providing quality jobs to the country’s young graduates passing out of engineering institutes and universities, it needs to grow at a much faster and steadier pace.

The Government’s National Manufacturing Policy has set an ambitious target to increase the share of manufacturing in the country’s GDP to 25 percent by 2025 from around 17 percent at present.

The productivity linked incentive (PLI) scheme for a big push to manufacturing, launched in 2022 with an allocation of Rs 1.97 lakh crore, has produced some good results but not gone far enough.

The PLI scheme has succeeded in industries such as mobile phone manufacturing with companies such as US tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Taiwan-headquartered multinational company Foxconn setting up manufacturing facilities in the country and giving a major fillip to exports as well. Pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, and food processing industries are other areas that have done well.

However, the PLI scheme has not produced the desired results in other segments such as the manufacture of solar PV modules, and electric vehicles.

Another positive outcome has been that India has become an increasingly attractive location for multinationals across a wide range of industries, with foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows touching a record high of USD 85 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal year, according to the RBI. With global players looking to set up supply chains outside China, India’s large domestic market provides an ideal alternative.

Major investments such as the Airbus-Tata joint venture to manufacture military planes in Vadodra has also taken off this year. Similarly, work is on to set up a factory to produce semiconductors by US chip giant Micron (NASDAQ: ) Technologies near Ahmedabad.

However, slowing global growth which is dragging down exports, geopolitical risks and volatile global financial conditions weigh heavily on the outlook ahead for the manufacturing sector.

India has retained its position as the fastest growing large economy ahead of China in the IMF’s latest forecast on economic growth rates. However, according to a report by Barclays (LON: ), India needs to grow at 8% for some years in order to overtake China in terms of contribution to the global economy.This is because China’s GDP is $17.7 trillion which is about five times that of India.

India’s growth has also been largely driven by the services sector which contributes as much as 55% to the country’s GDP with the manufacturing sector’s share at around 17%.

The government’s jobs data showed that since 2018-19, the last pre-pandemic year, and 2022-23, a part of the labour force has gone back to agriculture. In 2022-23, agriculture’s share of the workforce was 45.8%, over three percentage points more than 2018-19. The change in composition was partly on account of a modest decline in the workforce engaged by the manufacturing sector. In 2022-23, only 11.4% of the country’s workforce was in manufacturing.

The Barclays report points out that, India needs to invest more investments in traditional sectors such as mining and power utilities to surpass China as the biggest contributor to world GDP.

Investments in those sectors have taken a back seat in recent years compared to newer industries, such as telecommunications and the digital sector, Rahul Bajoria, a senior economist at Barclays, wrote in the report.

More investment, especially in traditional sectors, should also have a positive impact on employment and household income, and this could help policy makers to formulate better policies for economic growth, he added.

This comes despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department to curtail such deals, with courts often expressing skepticism towards their arguments.

The FTC continues to contest Microsoft's acquisition, voicing concerns that it could lead to the tech giant dominating the game streaming market. As part of the deal, Microsoft has pledged to make one of Activision’s major game franchises available to other consoles for a decade in an effort to alleviate competition concerns.

This presumption in favor of vertical transactions has been entrenched since the late 1970s. However, President Biden’s top antitrust officials, FTC chair Lina Khan and Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter, have been actively challenging vertical mergers since their appointments in 2021.

In 2017, marking its first attempt to halt a vertical deal in decades, the Justice Department sought to block the $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (NYSE: ) and Time Warner. Despite these initiatives, judges frequently dismiss these challenges due to a perceived lack of evidence.

Microsoft also arrived at a settlement with the European Union, vowing to make Activision titles accessible to competitors in the emerging market for game streaming. This follows unsuccessful attempts by Khan's FTC in 2021 to prevent Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s acquisition of Arm and Lockheed Martin’s $4.4 billion purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ). The Justice Department's lawsuit against UnitedHealth (NYSE: ) Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: ) was similarly dismissed.

This anticipated recovery is linked to easing inflation and the debut of innovative products, such as Apple (NASDAQ: )'s MacBook using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) 3nm fabrication process.

The MacBook, set for a 2024 launch, will feature the M3 chip, marking an advancement from the M2 chip that was launched in June 2022. The M3 chip is expected to enhance performance and power efficiency and could potentially feature a new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, similar to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro.

However, DigiTimes also predicts a decrease in notebooks using Arm-based processors in 2022 due to Apple's planned reduction in shipments. This transition aims at replacing these processors with CPUs manufactured by a 3nm node at TSMC for enhanced performance.

Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggests that the first Macs with the M3 chip could be unveiled this October. However, Dexerto indicates that M3 MacBooks are not expected until sometime in 2024. The M3 chip will likely feature in the newly launched models such as the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro models, and potentially the upcoming iMac, 13-inch MacBook Air, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.

They argue that ""transformational AI growth and stabilizing IT spending environment will create a massive tech rally heading into year-end in which we expect tech stocks to be up another 12%-15% in 4Q.""

Despite the perplexing macroeconomic and bond market conditions, compounded by the disconcerting geopolitical aftermath of the recent terrorist attack in Israel, the analysts maintain their conviction that the technology sector is robust and well-prepared for a forthcoming earnings season that will defy the skeptics.

The analysts said they are using the macro and Fed worries as a time to ""double down on our bullish tech thesis....and NOT panic.""

They see tech stocks poised for robust growth, driven by AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and a digital ad rebound, overlooked by the market. Further, they anticipate 2024 Fed rate cuts, relieving the yield obsession, with a projected soft landing.

They are focused on generational AI growth and $1 trillion of tech spending over the next decade.

The analysts' favorite tech names remain Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto (NASDAQ: ), Palantir (NYSE: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ), and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ).

This move marks a significant leap from the first-generation N3B technology used in the A17 Pro chip for the current iPhone 15 Pro models.

The adoption of the N3E process is expected to enhance chip performance and power consumption across the new iPhone range. The process will be adopted by all major chip vendors, with the exception of Samsung (KS: ), starting from 2024.

With Intel (NASDAQ: ) experiencing delays in its CPU platform design plans, Apple is projected to utilize all of TSMC's 3nm production capacity at its Taiwanese pure-play foundry. This move could contribute up to $3.4 billion in sales or constitute 4-6% of TSMC's overall sales in 2022.

In addition to Apple's commitment, TSMC has plans to advance N3P to volume production by late 2024. This offers a 1.04x increase in chip density, a speed increase of 5%, and a reduction in power usage between 5-10% over the N3E process.

The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature a faster 5G modem, Wi-Fi 7, and a new 48MP sensor for the ultrawide lens. Major chipmakers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), MediaTek, and AMD are also anticipated to commission N3E circuitry from TSMC for their advanced chips.

2022-10-12, Investing.com,Qualcomm Set to Challenge Apple With New Snapdragon X Chips,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-set-to-challenge-apple-with-new-snapdragon-x-chips-93CH-3847918,"On Thursday, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) announced its plans to launch a new line of Arm-based Snapdragon X chips in 2024, marking a significant shift from its previous Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chip. The new processors, developed by former Apple (NASDAQ: ) engineers at Nuvia, a company acquired by Qualcomm in 2021, are expected to rival Apple's M-series processors.

The Snapdragon X series will replace Qualcomm's existing Snapdragon 8CX/7C lineup for future Windows laptops and PCs. The new chips aim to match the efficiency of Apple's M2 chips and deliver MacBook-like productivity and battery life. This is a strategic move by Qualcomm to compete directly with Apple's M-series used in various devices including iMacs, Mac Minis, Mac Pros, and MacBooks.

The Snapdragon X chips are expected to feature Qualcomm's next-generation custom Oryon CPU and neural processing unit (NPU), offering a leap in performance and power efficiency. This advancement is especially important for generative AI applications and improved on-device user experiences. The chips will also support 5G connectivity, similar to the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 platform.

In addition to performance enhancements, the Snapdragon X series will introduce a unique visual design system and a clear tiering structure that differentiates entry-level from premium flagship-grade chips. This structure aims to guide users from mainstream to premium capabilities.

Despite a previous lawsuit by Apple against Nuvia co-founder Gerard Williams for poaching employees, Qualcomm is set to challenge not only Apple but also Intel (NASDAQ: )'s Core and AMD's Ryzen CPUs in mainstream laptops with its new chips.

The detailed specifications of the advanced chipsets are set to be unveiled at the upcoming Snapdragon Summit 2022 in October. With superior power, efficiency, and cellular connectivity, these chips could make Windows laptops a more compelling choice for consumers.

Devices like Samsung (KS: )'s Galaxy Book laptops could potentially feature these new processors, heralding a revolution in the PC industry.

The much-anticipated launch, slated for the annual Snapdragon Summit on October 24, marks a significant shift in Qualcomm's product strategy.

The Snapdragon X series, powered by a custom Oryon CPU, is designed to surpass the performance and power efficiency of its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8cx processors. The new series will be incorporated into a diverse range of products including PCs, smartphones, digital cockpits, extended reality devices, and advanced driver assistance systems.

This strategic move comes as a response to substantial consumer feedback and market trends. Qualcomm is renaming its Windows on ARM chips to avoid overlap with its Android-centric Snapdragon chips. The 'X' identifier in the new series segregates PC platforms from other Snapdragon categories, simplifying the company's product tiering structure.

The visual rebranding extends to the iconic Snapdragon fireball logo which will be replaced by the Snapdragon X branding. This change aims to assist users in distinguishing between mobile and desktop processors.

The introduction of the Oryon CPU last year marked a significant turning point for Qualcomm. The acquisition of chip design startup Nuvia has enabled Qualcomm to design its own chips from scratch, escalating competition with System-on-Chip (SoC) leaders like Apple and Intel.

The Snapdragon X series is poised to challenge high-performance chips such as Apple's M2 or Intel's i9 series. This move signifies Qualcomm's ambitious entry into the PC revolution, as it aims to strengthen its position in the PC chip market.

Despite leading in the Android industry, Qualcomm faces stiff competition from Intel in the PC market. The performance-oriented Snapdragon X Series pledges a ""quantum leap forward in performance and power efficiency"", positioning the company to compete more aggressively in the PC chip domain.

According to InvestingPro, Qualcomm operates with a current market cap of 125.18B USD and a P/E ratio of 14.5, indicating a healthy financial standing. The company has consistently demonstrated a high return on invested capital and has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years, as highlighted by InvestingPro Tips. This financial stability is likely to support Qualcomm's ambitious plans for the Snapdragon X series.

The market launch of devices equipped with X Series System-on-Chips (SoCs) is anticipated in 2024. Following the initial entry into the chip series, Qualcomm plans to develop a successor to further bolster the X Series line-up.

This move could lead to a decrease in deliveries of Arm-based notebooks next year. The tech giant first introduced its M2 Macs in June 2022, later expanding the lineup with high-end Mac Studio and Mac Pro models.

The same reports suggest that Apple is poised to release its first MacBooks integrated with TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024. This coincides with a recent forecast predicting a 4.7% boost in global notebook shipments that year, owing to deflation and the debut of innovative products.

However, the market anticipates a drop in the share for notebooks utilizing Arm-based processors in 2022, aligning with Apple's shift from these processors to CPUs manufactured by a 3nm node at TSMC.

The highly anticipated M3 chip is predicted to replace the current 5nm-based M2 chip and is expected to be fabricated using TSMC's 3nm process, which is likely to offer superior performance and energy efficiency.

In addition, Apple is expected to announce new entry-level MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac models that come equipped with the M3 chip. Also, an upgrade for the microLED display of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models is expected soon.

2022-10-12, AMBCrypto,Can Australia’s new digital payment rules influence crypto sector,https://in.investing.com/news/can-australias-new-digital-payment-rules-influence-crypto-sector-3847036,"The proposal was in response to the rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

The Australian government seeks to regulate non-bank digital payment wallets and transactions in the country to modern standards.

This development was in response to the remarkable rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and WeChat Pay. Notably, these proposed regulations could have a profound impact on the cryptocurrency landscape in Australia.

Digital payment platforms have experienced exponential growth, witnessing a surge in transaction volumes from 29.2 million in 2018 to a staggering 2.4 billion in 2022.

As the country grapples with this evolving financial landscape, the government is looking to modernize the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act (PSRA) of 1988. The proposed changes look to expand the definitions of essential terms like “payment system” and “participant.”

Traditional financial systems to gain more push Under the current regulatory framework, Australia’s Reserve Bank is the sole authority. However, the proposed modifications introduce civil penalty provisions, “enforceable undertakings,” and an increase in maximum criminal penalties where applicable. What makes this development particularly noteworthy is its potential implications for the cryptocurrency sector.

Although digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay generally require connections to regulated bank accounts and credit cards, transactions involving digital wallets currently exist outside the realm of Australia’s financial regulations and banking systems.

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

A game changer for the Australian crypto market? The revised regulatory framework does not explicitly mention digital currencies or blockchain technology. However, the broader definitions of terms like “funds” and “payment system” could potentially encompass digital assets like cryptocurrencies if the government deems it necessary.

In many countries, including Australia, cryptocurrencies are primarily used for speculative trading, with limited adoption for consumer purchases. These regulations may signal a shift in how cryptocurrencies are treated within the regulatory landscape.

The motivations behind the government’s decision to enact these regulatory changes have sparked several theories.

One suggests that governments naturally seek increased surveillance and control, extending these powers to encompass payments outside the traditional banking system. This could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency sector, as it operates outside the traditional financial framework.

Another perspective points to the banking sector’s desire for greater transparency regarding technology giants’ fee structures and transaction statistics. As digital payments become more prevalent, large banks are looking to maintain their competitive edge.

However, it is to be noted that Australia’s approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain has historically been favorable, with cryptocurrencies like recognized as legal and treated as property. Cryptocurrencies can be traded, spent, received, and stored in the country. It is also accepted as a means of payment for personal and business transactions. However, merchants are not obligated to accept them.

Additionally, the government is taking steps to develop a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector. The main focus is on consumer protection and market integrity."

UBS’ data tracking iPhone availability in 30 countries reveals that wait times for high-end models have shortened in most regions in recent weeks. However, in China, wait times for the Pro model have increased by about 4 days to approximately 23 days.

Wait times for the Pro model have decreased by about 1 day in the U.S., 2 days in Europe, and 6 days in Japan since the last check. Similarly, for the Pro Max, wait times have reduced by approximately 2 days in the U.S. and China, 5 days in Europe, and 6 days in Japan.

In comparison to the previous year, wait times for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in the US and China are longer than for the 14 Pro and Pro Max models.

“The elevated wait times for the high-end segment are now essentially flattish YoY both in Europe and Japan, a risk as these two geographies had demonstrated some strength in demand. As a result, with the US and China tracking below last year's models and any potential upside in Europe now relatively muted, we think that any upside to our estimates in the segment is limited,” the analysts added.

Given that the high-end segment accounts for 63% of total iPhone 15 procurement and with demand showing signs of softening, the analysts see a risk to their 49 million iPhone projection for the September quarter.

On the other hand, demand for the iPhone15 Base/Plus is “showing some resilience globally.”

Wait times for the Pro have declined ~1 day in the US, ~2 days in Europe, and ~6 days in Japan since Thursday. Then for the Pro Max, wait times have shortened ~2 days in the US and China, ~5 days in Europe, and ~6 days in Japan. Compared to last year, however, wait times for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models lag that of the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the US and China. Further, the elevated wait times for the high-end segment are now essentially flattish YoY both in Europe and Japan, a risk as these two geographies had demonstrated some strength in demand. As a result, with the US and China tracking below last year's models and any potential upside in Europe now relatively muted, we think that any upside to our estimates in the segment is limited.

Kuo believes these features are at least two years away from being added to the Apple Watch.

He also predicted that this year's Apple Watch shipments are expected to decline by approximately 15 per cent (year-on-year) to 36-38 million units.

""The Apple Watch is a classic example of a product that succeeded through repositioning. However, based on current shipment momentum, it may need to be repositioned again if there’s an unfortunate year-over-year decline again in 2024,"" Kuo stated.

According to the analyst, integrating Vision Pro headsets with the Apple Watch can create an unparalleled and innovative health management experience to drive shipment momentum for both products further.

Meanwhile, Apple's 3nm chipsets, which are just beginning to hit the market, with the Apple A17 Pro being the first, are expected to see a decline in demand in 2024.

According to Kuo, demand for this emerging technology may be weak next year, prompting major players to take a step back.

Apple is expected to reduce orders for 3nm chips next year, forcing the Netherlands-based semiconductor company ASML to reduce EUV equipment shipment by 20 to 30 per cent.

This significant shift has been observed on Wednesday.

The retaliatory measures from China have had a profound impact on companies such as Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) and led to an iPhone ban, resulting in a sales decline for US brands since 2018. Notably, GM experienced a significant market share drop due to these developments.

De-risking efforts have inadvertently increased operational risks such as supply chain complexity and lack of transparency. Companies like South Korea’s SK Hynix and Boeing (NYSE: ) have been affected by these challenges. Boeing's 787 aircraft production has faced setbacks due to these complications.

To mitigate the potential fallouts of this shift, several measures have been put in place. Government support has been extended in the form of the $52.7 billion US Chips Act subsidies. International agreements like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and CPTPP have also been implemented to help navigate these changes.

Another significant factor influencing supply chain decisions is the US Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act. The legislation has further complicated the global supply chain landscape, adding another layer of consideration for companies as they make strategic decisions about their operations.

The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, endorsed by Newsom on Friday, requires U.S. companies with annual revenues surpassing $1 billion to disclose both direct and indirect emissions from 2026 onwards. The Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, meanwhile, mandates firms earning $500 million or more to reveal financial risks associated with climate change and risk mitigation strategies.

The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act surpasses the scope of current federal and state reporting requirements. It demands companies operating in California to report even indirect greenhouse gas emissions, including those from supply chains, business travel, employees' commutes, and the use of their products by consumers. For example, Chevron (NYSE: ) will need to account for emissions from vehicles using their gasoline, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) will have to consider emissions from materials used in their products like iPhones.

The new laws also cover scope 3 emissions, which are supervised by the California Air Resources Board with a degree of leniency. Many firms listed on the voluntarily report to the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), and some comply with the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.

Research suggests that disclosure mandates similar to the U.K.'s 2013 one can lead to operational emission reductions, thus combatting greenwashing. Despite opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce, major corporations such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Salesforce (NYSE: ), and Patagonia have endorsed these laws. This introduction is expected to have far-reaching global implications.

The newly introduced rules go beyond the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed corporate climate disclosure rules. Companies like Apple have been actively working with suppliers to reduce emissions, indicating a proactive approach towards environmental sustainability within the corporate sector.

Three such apps, including Xuexi Xinde Zimu, were discovered by a local media outlet on Apple's App Store in China.

The report noted that these apps -- which lead users to either online gambling or pornographic websites -- have now been taken down.

The malicious apps were discovered despite Apple's strict policies against such content.

However, this wasn't the first time a malicious programme has been discovered in Apple's China App Store. There was a Small Fat Answer app found there in July that directed users to pornographic websites, according to the report.

Apple's China App Store has been under scrutiny since local regulations required app distribution platforms to register apps and developers with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

The tech giant recently updated its app developer website to reflect the latest registration policies. In its guidelines, Apple specified that developers must submit an “internet content provider filing” when they publish new apps on its China App Store.

Additionally, before the general public could download specific apps, the company required them to receive the right licensing from Chinese authorities.

Though demand and the global economy remain subdued, PC shipments have increased in each of the last two quarters, slowing the rate of annual decline and indicating that the market has moved past the bottom of the trough, the report mentioned.

While most of the top five vendors experienced double-digit declines during the quarter, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s outsized decline was the result of unfavorable year-over-year comparisons as the company recovered from a Covid-related halt in production during the third quarter last year.

Meanwhile, HP's growth was largely due to the normalising of inventory, said the report.

""The PC industry is on a slow path to recovery as a device refresh cycle and end of support for Windows 10 will help drive sales in the second half of 2024 and beyond. In the meantime, the PC industry will unfortunately experience more pain,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers.

The slowness in the industry is giving the supply chain an opportunity to explore procurement and production options outside China and this will likely remain a key issue going forward, second only to the advancement of AI within PCs, he added.

Generative AI could be a watershed moment for the PC industry.

“AI PCs promise organisations the ability to personalize the user experience at a deeper level all while being able to preserve data privacy and sovereignty.

Our analysis suggests that Licensing (34% of F23E Services revs, +11% y/y) and Subscription Services (34% of F23E Services revs, +13% y/y) will likely drive the bulk of n-t rev growth (Fig 1). For Licensing, revs tied to Safari payments (Google (NASDAQ: ) TAC) remains the main contributor (75% of Licensing rev in F23); however, we note that there is some risk from litigation as Google’s payments to Apple are under scrutiny. Within Licensing, we expect search Ad rev to accelerate. Maintain Neutral on balanced risk/reward. Our PO stays at $208 on 32x our C24E EPS of $6.45."""

2022-10-10, IANS,ChatGPT’s revenue growth slows down as mobile app downloads grow,https://in.investing.com/news/chatgpts-revenue-growth-slows-down-as-mobile-app-downloads-grow-3842905,"New Delhi, Oct 10 (IANS) OpenAI’s ChatGPT is seeing a slow down in its revenue growth, an indication that the AI chatbot is nearing saturation in terms of how many users are willing to pay for its paid service.According to data from market intelligence firm Appfigures, ChatGPT was witnessing more than 30 per cent revenue growth in the last couple of months but now, the rate at which revenue grew is actually the lowest to date at just 20 per cent (as of September).

Although 20 per cent growth is still “amazing especially when we're looking at millions, it's lower than the previous months which were in the 30s,” the report noted.

The upgraded ChatGPT+ subscription service costs $19.99 per month that offers faster response times, priority access at peak times and early access to new features and improvements.

“Our estimates show ChatGPT earned $3.2 million in September from the App Store and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play. That is net which means what OpenAI gets to keep after Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google take their fees,” Appfigures said in its report.

Around 15.6 million people downloaded OpenAI's ChatGPT app in September.

The official ChatGPT app from OpenAI has been on the App Store since May and Google Play since July.

The report said that with a few small tweaks, OpenAI can easily increase that conversion rate and see much faster revenue growth.

Last month, OpenAI said it expected to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2022.

The cost of running ChatGPT is prohibitively high for the company. According to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, each enquiry costs about 4 US cents.

If ChatGPT queries grew to a tenth the size of Google searches, it would require about $48.1 billion in GPUs initially and around $16 billion in chips per year to remain functioning.

Sam Altman-run OpenAI is also reportedly raising funds at a valuation of $80-$90 billion via sale of existing shares.

2022-10-12, Investing.com,"Qualcomm to Launch Snapdragon X Series, Eyeing Competition With Apple and Intel",https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-to-launch-snapdragon-x-series-eyeing-competition-with-apple-and-intel-93CH-3847911,"In an ambitious move, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), a prominent player in the Semiconductors and semiconductor Equipment industry according to InvestingPro Tips, is set to unveil its Snapdragon X series, a new line of high-performance chips aimed at competing with industry giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ). The much-anticipated launch, slated for the annual Snapdragon Summit on October 24, marks a significant shift in Qualcomm's product strategy.

The Snapdragon X series, powered by a custom Oryon CPU, is designed to surpass the performance and power efficiency of its predecessor, the Snapdragon 8cx processors. The new series will be incorporated into a diverse range of products including PCs, smartphones, digital cockpits, extended reality devices, and advanced driver assistance systems.

This strategic move comes as a response to substantial consumer feedback and market trends. Qualcomm is renaming its Windows on ARM chips to avoid overlap with its Android-centric Snapdragon chips. The 'X' identifier in the new series segregates PC platforms from other Snapdragon categories, simplifying the company's product tiering structure.

The visual rebranding extends to the iconic Snapdragon fireball logo which will be replaced by the Snapdragon X branding. This change aims to assist users in distinguishing between mobile and desktop processors.

The introduction of the Oryon CPU last year marked a significant turning point for Qualcomm. The acquisition of chip design startup Nuvia has enabled Qualcomm to design its own chips from scratch, escalating competition with System-on-Chip (SoC) leaders like Apple and Intel.

The Snapdragon X series is poised to challenge high-performance chips such as Apple's M2 or Intel's i9 series. This move signifies Qualcomm's ambitious entry into the PC revolution, as it aims to strengthen its position in the PC chip market.

Despite leading in the Android industry, Qualcomm faces stiff competition from Intel in the PC market. The performance-oriented Snapdragon X Series pledges a ""quantum leap forward in performance and power efficiency"", positioning the company to compete more aggressively in the PC chip domain.

According to InvestingPro, Qualcomm operates with a current market cap of 125.18B USD and a P/E ratio of 14.5, indicating a healthy financial standing. The company has consistently demonstrated a high return on invested capital and has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years, as highlighted by InvestingPro Tips. This financial stability is likely to support Qualcomm's ambitious plans for the Snapdragon X series.

The market launch of devices equipped with X Series System-on-Chips (SoCs) is anticipated in 2024. Following the initial entry into the chip series, Qualcomm plans to develop a successor to further bolster the X Series line-up.

This move could lead to a decrease in deliveries of Arm-based notebooks next year. The tech giant first introduced its M2 Macs in June 2022, later expanding the lineup with high-end Mac Studio and Mac Pro models.

The same reports suggest that Apple is poised to release its first MacBooks integrated with TSMC's 3nm fabrication process in 2024. This coincides with a recent forecast predicting a 4.7% boost in global notebook shipments that year, owing to deflation and the debut of innovative products.

However, the market anticipates a drop in the share for notebooks utilizing Arm-based processors in 2022, aligning with Apple's shift from these processors to CPUs manufactured by a 3nm node at TSMC.

The highly anticipated M3 chip is predicted to replace the current 5nm-based M2 chip and is expected to be fabricated using TSMC's 3nm process, which is likely to offer superior performance and energy efficiency.

In addition, Apple is expected to announce new entry-level MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and iMac models that come equipped with the M3 chip. Also, an upgrade for the microLED display of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models is expected soon.

2022-10-12, AMBCrypto,Can Australia’s new digital payment rules influence crypto sector,https://in.investing.com/news/can-australias-new-digital-payment-rules-influence-crypto-sector-3847036,"The proposal was in response to the rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

The Australian government seeks to regulate non-bank digital payment wallets and transactions in the country to modern standards.

This development was in response to the remarkable rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and WeChat Pay. Notably, these proposed regulations could have a profound impact on the cryptocurrency landscape in Australia.

Digital payment platforms have experienced exponential growth, witnessing a surge in transaction volumes from 29.2 million in 2018 to a staggering 2.4 billion in 2022.

As the country grapples with this evolving financial landscape, the government is looking to modernize the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act (PSRA) of 1988. The proposed changes look to expand the definitions of essential terms like “payment system” and “participant.”

Traditional financial systems to gain more push Under the current regulatory framework, Australia’s Reserve Bank is the sole authority. However, the proposed modifications introduce civil penalty provisions, “enforceable undertakings,” and an increase in maximum criminal penalties where applicable. What makes this development particularly noteworthy is its potential implications for the cryptocurrency sector.

Although digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay generally require connections to regulated bank accounts and credit cards, transactions involving digital wallets currently exist outside the realm of Australia’s financial regulations and banking systems.

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

A game changer for the Australian crypto market? The revised regulatory framework does not explicitly mention digital currencies or blockchain technology. However, the broader definitions of terms like “funds” and “payment system” could potentially encompass digital assets like cryptocurrencies if the government deems it necessary.

In many countries, including Australia, cryptocurrencies are primarily used for speculative trading, with limited adoption for consumer purchases. These regulations may signal a shift in how cryptocurrencies are treated within the regulatory landscape.

The motivations behind the government’s decision to enact these regulatory changes have sparked several theories.

One suggests that governments naturally seek increased surveillance and control, extending these powers to encompass payments outside the traditional banking system. This could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency sector, as it operates outside the traditional financial framework.

Another perspective points to the banking sector’s desire for greater transparency regarding technology giants’ fee structures and transaction statistics. As digital payments become more prevalent, large banks are looking to maintain their competitive edge.

However, it is to be noted that Australia’s approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain has historically been favorable, with cryptocurrencies like recognized as legal and treated as property. Cryptocurrencies can be traded, spent, received, and stored in the country. It is also accepted as a means of payment for personal and business transactions. However, merchants are not obligated to accept them.

Additionally, the government is taking steps to develop a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector. The main focus is on consumer protection and market integrity."

UBS’ data tracking iPhone availability in 30 countries reveals that wait times for high-end models have shortened in most regions in recent weeks. However, in China, wait times for the Pro model have increased by about 4 days to approximately 23 days.

Wait times for the Pro model have decreased by about 1 day in the U.S., 2 days in Europe, and 6 days in Japan since the last check. Similarly, for the Pro Max, wait times have reduced by approximately 2 days in the U.S. and China, 5 days in Europe, and 6 days in Japan.

In comparison to the previous year, wait times for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models in the US and China are longer than for the 14 Pro and Pro Max models.

“The elevated wait times for the high-end segment are now essentially flattish YoY both in Europe and Japan, a risk as these two geographies had demonstrated some strength in demand. As a result, with the US and China tracking below last year's models and any potential upside in Europe now relatively muted, we think that any upside to our estimates in the segment is limited,” the analysts added.

Given that the high-end segment accounts for 63% of total iPhone 15 procurement and with demand showing signs of softening, the analysts see a risk to their 49 million iPhone projection for the September quarter.

On the other hand, demand for the iPhone15 Base/Plus is “showing some resilience globally.”

Kuo believes these features are at least two years away from being added to the Apple Watch.

He also predicted that this year's Apple Watch shipments are expected to decline by approximately 15 per cent (year-on-year) to 36-38 million units.

""The Apple Watch is a classic example of a product that succeeded through repositioning. However, based on current shipment momentum, it may need to be repositioned again if there’s an unfortunate year-over-year decline again in 2024,"" Kuo stated.

According to the analyst, integrating Vision Pro headsets with the Apple Watch can create an unparalleled and innovative health management experience to drive shipment momentum for both products further.

Meanwhile, Apple's 3nm chipsets, which are just beginning to hit the market, with the Apple A17 Pro being the first, are expected to see a decline in demand in 2024.

According to Kuo, demand for this emerging technology may be weak next year, prompting major players to take a step back.

Apple is expected to reduce orders for 3nm chips next year, forcing the Netherlands-based semiconductor company ASML to reduce EUV equipment shipment by 20 to 30 per cent.

This significant shift has been observed on Wednesday.

The retaliatory measures from China have had a profound impact on companies such as Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) and led to an iPhone ban, resulting in a sales decline for US brands since 2018. Notably, GM experienced a significant market share drop due to these developments.

De-risking efforts have inadvertently increased operational risks such as supply chain complexity and lack of transparency. Companies like South Korea’s SK Hynix and Boeing (NYSE: ) have been affected by these challenges. Boeing's 787 aircraft production has faced setbacks due to these complications.

To mitigate the potential fallouts of this shift, several measures have been put in place. Government support has been extended in the form of the $52.7 billion US Chips Act subsidies. International agreements like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and CPTPP have also been implemented to help navigate these changes.

Another significant factor influencing supply chain decisions is the US Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act. The legislation has further complicated the global supply chain landscape, adding another layer of consideration for companies as they make strategic decisions about their operations.

However, it appears that even in a rising market, certain sectors or companies can experience declines, demonstrating the complex and multifaceted nature of stock market movements.

While this decline marks the end of a four-day winning streak for Apple, it remains to be seen how the company's stock will perform in the coming days and weeks ahead. With tech stocks showing some volatility despite broader market gains, investors will likely be keeping a close eye on these developments.

2022-10-10, Investing.com,"California enforces stringent climate laws, demanding large corporations to report greenhouse gas emissions",https://in.investing.com/news/california-enforces-stringent-climate-laws-demanding-large-corporations-to-report-greenhouse-gas-emissions-93CH-3844003,"Governor Gavin Newsom of California has recently implemented two crucial climate laws, pushing large corporations to closely monitor and report their greenhouse gas emissions. The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act, endorsed by Newsom on Friday, requires U.S. companies with annual revenues surpassing $1 billion to disclose both direct and indirect emissions from 2026 onwards. The Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, meanwhile, mandates firms earning $500 million or more to reveal financial risks associated with climate change and risk mitigation strategies.

The Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act surpasses the scope of current federal and state reporting requirements. It demands companies operating in California to report even indirect greenhouse gas emissions, including those from supply chains, business travel, employees' commutes, and the use of their products by consumers. For example, Chevron (NYSE: ) will need to account for emissions from vehicles using their gasoline, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) will have to consider emissions from materials used in their products like iPhones.

The new laws also cover scope 3 emissions, which are supervised by the California Air Resources Board with a degree of leniency. Many firms listed on the voluntarily report to the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), and some comply with the European Union’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.

Research suggests that disclosure mandates similar to the U.K.'s 2013 one can lead to operational emission reductions, thus combatting greenwashing. Despite opposition from the California Chamber of Commerce, major corporations such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Salesforce (NYSE: ), and Patagonia have endorsed these laws. This introduction is expected to have far-reaching global implications.

The newly introduced rules go beyond the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed corporate climate disclosure rules. Companies like Apple have been actively working with suppliers to reduce emissions, indicating a proactive approach towards environmental sustainability within the corporate sector.

Three such apps, including Xuexi Xinde Zimu, were discovered by a local media outlet on Apple's App Store in China.

The report noted that these apps -- which lead users to either online gambling or pornographic websites -- have now been taken down.

The malicious apps were discovered despite Apple's strict policies against such content.

However, this wasn't the first time a malicious programme has been discovered in Apple's China App Store. There was a Small Fat Answer app found there in July that directed users to pornographic websites, according to the report.

Apple's China App Store has been under scrutiny since local regulations required app distribution platforms to register apps and developers with the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC).

The tech giant recently updated its app developer website to reflect the latest registration policies. In its guidelines, Apple specified that developers must submit an “internet content provider filing” when they publish new apps on its China App Store.

Additionally, before the general public could download specific apps, the company required them to receive the right licensing from Chinese authorities.

Though demand and the global economy remain subdued, PC shipments have increased in each of the last two quarters, slowing the rate of annual decline and indicating that the market has moved past the bottom of the trough, the report mentioned.

While most of the top five vendors experienced double-digit declines during the quarter, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s outsized decline was the result of unfavorable year-over-year comparisons as the company recovered from a Covid-related halt in production during the third quarter last year.

Meanwhile, HP's growth was largely due to the normalising of inventory, said the report.

""The PC industry is on a slow path to recovery as a device refresh cycle and end of support for Windows 10 will help drive sales in the second half of 2024 and beyond. In the meantime, the PC industry will unfortunately experience more pain,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers.

The slowness in the industry is giving the supply chain an opportunity to explore procurement and production options outside China and this will likely remain a key issue going forward, second only to the advancement of AI within PCs, he added.

Generative AI could be a watershed moment for the PC industry.

“AI PCs promise organisations the ability to personalize the user experience at a deeper level all while being able to preserve data privacy and sovereignty. As more of these devices launch next year, we expect a significant boost to overall selling prices,” said Linn Huang, research vice president, Devices & Displays at IDC.

""Survey says Microsoft followed by Google are early leaders...while Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) are expected to narrow the gap,"" the analysts revealed.

""One of the top takeaways from the survey was Microsoft taking the early lead in the race with its OpenAI acquisition as the company has a significant AI monetization opportunity within Azure through Microsoft Co-Pilot while Google is also being viewed as a major Generative AI player now and down the road as it further improves Bard and its PaLM/LaMDA LLMs,"" the analysts added.

For Licensing, revs tied to Safari payments (Google (NASDAQ: ) TAC) remains the main contributor (75% of Licensing rev in F23); however, we note that there is some risk from litigation as Google’s payments to Apple are under scrutiny.

2022-10-10, IANS,ChatGPT’s revenue growth slows down as mobile app downloads grow,https://in.investing.com/news/chatgpts-revenue-growth-slows-down-as-mobile-app-downloads-grow-3842905,"New Delhi, Oct 10 (IANS) OpenAI’s ChatGPT is seeing a slow down in its revenue growth, an indication that the AI chatbot is nearing saturation in terms of how many users are willing to pay for its paid service.According to data from market intelligence firm Appfigures, ChatGPT was witnessing more than 30 per cent revenue growth in the last couple of months but now, the rate at which revenue grew is actually the lowest to date at just 20 per cent (as of September).

Although 20 per cent growth is still “amazing especially when we're looking at millions, it's lower than the previous months which were in the 30s,” the report noted.

The upgraded ChatGPT+ subscription service costs $19.99 per month that offers faster response times, priority access at peak times and early access to new features and improvements.

“Our estimates show ChatGPT earned $3.2 million in September from the App Store and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play. That is net which means what OpenAI gets to keep after Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google take their fees,” Appfigures said in its report.

Around 15.6 million people downloaded OpenAI's ChatGPT app in September.

The official ChatGPT app from OpenAI has been on the App Store since May and Google Play since July.

The report said that with a few small tweaks, OpenAI can easily increase that conversion rate and see much faster revenue growth.

Last month, OpenAI said it expected to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2022.

The cost of running ChatGPT is prohibitively high for the company. According to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, each enquiry costs about 4 US cents.

If ChatGPT queries grew to a tenth the size of Google searches, it would require about $48.1 billion in GPUs initially and around $16 billion in chips per year to remain functioning.

Sam Altman-run OpenAI is also reportedly raising funds at a valuation of $80-$90 billion via sale of existing shares.

The iPhone 15 Pro combines the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front.

The Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight; activating Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or using Shortcuts for more options.

A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback and visual cues in the Dynamic Island ensure the new button launches the intended action.

iPhone and third-party solutions like Capture One also help photographers create a pro studio, allowing them to shoot and instantly transfer 48MP ProRAW images from iPhone to Mac.

ProRes video can be recorded directly to external storage, enabling higher recording options up to 4K at 60 fps, and greater flexibility on set when using iPhone as the main camera.

iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Colour Encoding System, a global standard for colour workflows.

Coming later this year, iPhone 15 Pro will add a new dimension to video capture with the ability to record spatial video for Apple Vision Pro.

Both tech giants are leveraging their unique strengths to attract customers, with Apple emphasizing technical excellence and Meta capitalizing on its expansive gaming ecosystem.

Apple's latest offering, the Vision Pro, has been designed with a focus on comfort. This move comes in response to feedback regarding neck strain issues experienced by users of its predecessor. The Vision Pro is equipped with a high-resolution camera and a powerful M2 chip, reflecting Apple's commitment to technical superiority.

On the other hand, Meta has set an aggressive pricing strategy for its upcoming Quest 3, which will retail at $499. In addition to this competitive pricing, the company is considering further cost reductions. These could be achieved by unbundling hand controllers or introducing hand gesture controls. The strategy appears to be aimed at making the Quest 3 more accessible to a wider audience.

These developments indicate a strategic divergence between Apple and Meta in their approach to capturing market share in the mixed-reality headset sector. While Apple is banking on its technological prowess to draw customers, Meta is betting on its extensive gaming ecosystem and affordability.

Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cuts

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.

On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2022 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""

Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.

""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.

Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.

The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.

Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.

Netflix eyes price bump after actors strike: report

According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price bumps in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.

The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.

Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.





Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbers

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.

The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.

The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.

Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations & represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”

They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”

Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.

Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens grip

Starting recently, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.

The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.

Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.

2022-10-08, IANS,China’s smartphone market sees decline in 1st 8-month of 2022: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-smartphone-market-sees-decline-in-1st-8month-of-2022-report-3840911,"New Delhi, Oct 8 (IANS) The smartphone market in China has witnessed a decline in the first eight months of this year, manufacturing only 679 million devices from January to August, down 7.5 per cent from the same period in 2022, according to data published by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

As per Counterpoint Research, smartphone sales in the country also slowed down, falling 4 per cent (year on year) in the first eight months of 2022, reports South China Morning Post.

In the quarter to June, China's smartphone consumption fell to its lowest second-quarter sales figure since 2014, as macroeconomic headwinds weighed on consumer sentiment.

However, there is hope for improvement in the market’s outlook for the rest of 2022.

The upcoming winter sales season, as well as the release of new 5G smartphones by Huawei and Apple (NASDAQ: ), are expected to boost the industry.

Huawei's Mate 60 Pro series 5G handsets, in particular, have boosted the Chinese smartphone market's confidence, the report said.

According to Counterpoint, sales of Huawei's latest 5G smartphones will total between five and six million units by the end of the year.

Huawei's large domestic HarmonyOS user base is one factor contributing to this optimistic forecast. The company's new 5G devices are expected to attract new customers and entice former users who switched to other brands to return.

Huawei's smartphone sales increased 41 per cent in the first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year.

This upswing was primarily driven by large-cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ). The surge in stocks came in the wake of successful negotiations with the autoworkers union.

While the stock market was bouncing back, yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries showed signs of calming after reaching near highs of 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively. This occurred amidst a global bond decline that has been ongoing for five consecutive weeks.

In labor market news, the nonfarm payrolls report indicated an accelerated pace of hiring with 336,000 jobs added in September, more than double what economists had estimated. Despite this positive development, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8%.

Amid these conflicting signals from the U.S. labor data, traders are betting big on volatility ahead of November's Federal Reserve meeting.

In commodities news, oil posted its biggest weekly drop since March while gold slumped for the second week in a row. However, there was some positive momentum in digital currencies with rising 1.8% to US$27,977 and Ether increasing by 1.9% to US$1,647.22.

2022-10-06, Investing.com,Tech Giants See Premarket Shares Decline Following Strong September Jobs Report,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-see-premarket-shares-decline-following-strong-september-jobs-report-93CH-3839822,"The Magnificent 7 tech giants, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), witnessed a decline in their premarket trading shares on Friday. The downturn was triggered by a robust September jobs report, which exceeded expectations and reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve terminating its interest rate hike policy.

The stronger-than-expected jobs data has increased pressure on equity valuations, a factor that has been influencing the stock market for some time. This is because a strong labor market could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than previously anticipated, which could potentially make borrowing more expensive and slow down economic growth.

This downward trend was not confined to individual stocks but also impacted index trackers. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: ) and Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the , both reversed from initial gains to losses following the release of the jobs data. These ETFs are often seen as barometers for broader market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be reevaluating their positions in light of the latest economic indicators.

The Friday downturn comes amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties and concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves and any further economic data that could influence market trends.

Other categories like domestic stock funds, taxable bonds, and internationally oriented stock funds weren't spared either, witnessing declines of 3.5%, 1.1%, and 4.7%.

Tech giants Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) were among the most affected. Nvidia's shares fell nearly 12%, while Apple, contributing to a quarter of the S&P 500's decline, saw its shares drop by 11.7%. These figures were calculated by Birinyi Associates.

The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in an attempt to combat inflation was a significant factor behind these losses across stocks and bonds.

However, it wasn't all doom and gloom in the market. The energy sector saw some notable gains amid rising energy prices. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) enjoyed a surge of 9.6%, while Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: ) saw an impressive increase of 29.8%. This upward trend in energy stocks was not universal though, as Solar Edge suffered a substantial loss of 51.9%.

Interestingly, the higher fossil fuel prices turned out to be beneficial for certain funds. Despite the overall negative market performance, the Vanguard Energy Index Fund managed to capitalize on this situation, further highlighting the current volatility and sector-specific dynamics at play in the market.

They added that the major upgrades include a 50MP main camera for both models, a brighter display that could reach 2,400 nits for 8 Pro, and AI software features in photos/videos.

In August 2022, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) launched a probe into Google Play and App Store for their enforcement of certain in-app payment methods and other irregularities against app developers.

Wrapping up the probe, the commission decided to impose a fine of 47.5 billion won on Google and 20.5 billion won on Apple based on the judgment that they violated the country's revised Telecommunications Business Act by abusing their monopoly power to force local publishers to use specific billing systems and unfairly postponing due app review, reports Yonhap news agency.

The commission also found that Apple's policy imposing fees for domestic app developers constitutes a discriminatory act.

The KCC called on the two companies to implement corrective measures, saying that their practices are a ""grave issue"" as it could highly likely hamper fair market competition.

The commission plans to finalise the fine after listening to the opinions of the companies and going through due deliberation procedures.

In 2021, the National Assembly passed a law that bans app store operators from forcing in-app payment systems on developers, making South Korea the first country in the world to introduce such curbs on in-app billing policies of Apple and Google.

""Since the start of the fact finding investigation in August 2022, we have worked closely with KCC to explain how we are complying with the new law whilst ensuring that through our alternative billing, we continue to provide a safe and high quality experience for all,"" Google said in a statement.

""What KCC has shared today is the 'pre-notice' and we will carefully review and submit our response. Once the final written decision is shared with us we will carefully review to evaluate the next course of action,"" it added.

Apple refuted the commission's conclusions, stressing that it has long worked closely with local app developers and played a role in building a sound local app ecosystem in South Korea.

""We disagree with the conclusions made by the KCC in their Examiner's Report, and believe the changes we have implemented to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. As we have always done, we will continue to engage with the KCC to share our views,"" Apple said in a release.

""Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea's laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country's talented app developers, having helped build a vibrant local app ecosystem in the country that supports more than 18,000 developers with tools, resources, access to 175 storefronts globally, and a newly-opened Apple Developer Academy in Pohang,"" it added.

2022-10-05, The News Crypto,Stock-Exchange Platforms Bring Music Royalties as an Investable Asset Class to Everyone,https://in.investing.com/news/stockexchange-platforms-bring-music-royalties-as-an-investable-asset-class-to-everyone-3838384,"Music is often perceived as a form of entertainment, relaxation, and leisure. However, today the relationship between music and finance has become intricate with new platforms and emerging markets creating investment opportunities that both musicians and investors should be aware of. Generating income with music is now more exciting than ever.

Throughout history, music and business have always been interlinked. In order to live, musicians and composers need to find ways to make money from their compositions. Many centuries ago, classical artists would work under a patronage system with wealthy aristocrats or charge for music pieces commissioned for specific events.

Over time, this has evolved into a royalties system and incomes through merchandising and stadium concerts. This link between business and music has never been more true than over the past two decades, in more ways than any of us could have imagined.

One of the significant transformations in the music industry over the past three decades has been the appearance of streaming services. Platforms, such as Spotify, Apple (NASDAQ: ) Music, Soundcloud, and YouTube, have appeared and now offer an extensive variety of artists, songs, and podcasts to serve a worldwide audience. This solution offers a reliable source of income for established artists.

The advantages of these platforms are clear, they generate cash flow from individual streams, subscriptions from premium accounts, and advertisements. As a retail investor, one can also engage in this business model by investing in the stocks of streaming services like Spotify.

The question is: What do songs such as Justin Bieber’s “Purpose”, “Nobody Else” by Backstreet Boys, or Little Mix’s “Power” have in common? Well, every time you listen to or stream them, somebody is getting paid and it might as well be you! A recent trend is for renowned artists to sell their music rights to private equity companies like Blackstone (NYSE: ), and KKR Apollo, or stock-exchange platforms such as ANote Music.

The overall spending on music catalogues increased from 1.9 billion to 5.4 billion USD between 2020 and 2021. Music rights as an asset class have been traded since the creation of copyright laws, but they have never been available to retail investors to trade at scale. ANote wants to transform the music industry by unlocking access to this asset class, and by offering shares in music royalties of hit songs and popular artists from all eras on its platform via catalogues. The trading platform has successfully raised over €3.3 million to date, with nearly 90% of its investors enjoying profitability, boasting an average annual return exceeding 10%. Furthermore, the trading platform has disbursed over €500,000 in total royalties.

“Our goal is to unlock the hidden value in music for both investors and artists by creating Europe’s leading marketplace for music investments,” Marzio Schena, CEO of ANote Music told Investing.

So what’s in it for the parties involved? For artists, it allows getting a relatively large lump sum immediately instead of waiting for revenues gradually emerging from streaming or radio stations. For investors, it boils down to a simple diversification story. Investing in music catalogues provides a steady and consistent cash flow, and is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as fixed income or equity. Moreover, they may offer the additional advantage of being intellectual property and, thus, intangible assets.

Music is also not subject to the usual risky fluctuations of the financial markets. The most-heard hits of all time are truly timeless in that sense. A song that has sold millions of copies over the decades will most likely continue to be heard in the future and generate corresponding returns. These are therefore concrete assets with a proven track record. Such music catalogues ratings also often increase consistently. The music industry assumes annual net returns of between 5%-16%.

The music rights industry, traditionally, has been a walled garden, accessible only to a select few. The inherent complexities of music rights ownership and royalty collection have been major roadblocks for many. ANote’s platform allows music rights holders to auction fractional music royalty interests, artists gain both monetary benefits and retain their artistic freedom. For music enthusiasts, this platform is a golden opportunity to earn passive income from their favourite tracks’ royalties and for music creators, it’s a chance to monetize their art without compromising their creative integrity. This innovative approach enhances current global music business revenue streams and adds a multi-billion-dollar opportunity on top.

Marzio Schena, also added “Our mission is to make music even more valuable to even more people.”

Music may not only be deemed an attractive alternative investment but also indirectly affect the public by shifting market sentiments. Behavioural economists have also long advocated the use of psychology and human behaviour to explain the drivers of stock markets and how our behavioural biases and emotions affect our choices in financial markets."

Their advice comes at a time when Wall Street is showing signs of apprehension, evidenced by a rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield and a 7% dip in the since July. Despite this, he advises bullish investors to disregard the panic induced by bearish investors emerging from hibernation mode and to concentrate on acquiring premium tech stocks.

The analyst predicts favorable outcomes from the Federal Reserve's planned interest rate cuts in 2024, a robust tech earnings season, and a potential economic soft landing. Although tech stocks often bear the brunt during periods of macroeconomic fears and Federal Reserve jawboning, they recognize these periods as opportunities to buy top-quality growth tech stocks.

Among their preferred picks are Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), MongoDB (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ). Wedbush anticipates a significant rebound in the tech sector's growth in 2024 due to trends in AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.

“5G will continue to push smartphone demand in the coming years. Its presence has now reached lower price bands (Rs 10,000 and below). Further, it is interesting to see that 20 per cent of the respondents prefer switching to online platforms from offline modes, with the top reason for 43 per cent of this segment being the availability of the latest devices,” said Research Director Tarun Pathak.

The report also found that 22 per cent of the respondents consider cashbacks/rewards as their top preferred offer when making the smartphone purchase. This is followed by bank offers (21 per cent) and no-cost EMI (16 per cent).

iPhone 15 Pro also introduces a new option for Log encoding and is the first smartphone in the world to support ACES, the Academy Colour Encoding System, a global standard for colour workflows.

2022-10-08, Investing.com,Apple and Meta intensify competition in mixed-reality headset market,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-meta-intensify-competition-in-mixedreality-headset-market-93CH-3841141,"The mixed-reality headset market is witnessing a surge in competition with the entry of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Vision Pro and Meta (NASDAQ: )'s Quest 3, as observed on Sunday. Both tech giants are leveraging their unique strengths to attract customers, with Apple emphasizing technical excellence and Meta capitalizing on its expansive gaming ecosystem.

Apple's latest offering, the Vision Pro, has been designed with a focus on comfort. This move comes in response to feedback regarding neck strain issues experienced by users of its predecessor. The Vision Pro is equipped with a high-resolution camera and a powerful M2 chip, reflecting Apple's commitment to technical superiority.

On the other hand, Meta has set an aggressive pricing strategy for its upcoming Quest 3, which will retail at $499. In addition to this competitive pricing, the company is considering further cost reductions. These could be achieved by unbundling hand controllers or introducing hand gesture controls. The strategy appears to be aimed at making the Quest 3 more accessible to a wider audience.

These developments indicate a strategic divergence between Apple and Meta in their approach to capturing market share in the mixed-reality headset sector. While Apple is banking on its technological prowess to draw customers, Meta is betting on its extensive gaming ecosystem and affordability. As both companies gear up for their respective product launches, the industry awaits the impact of these strategies on the dynamics of the mixed-reality headset market.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Tesla's miss and price cut; Netflix's price bump; Apple's new China App Store policy; Rivian's debt offering.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cuts

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.

On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2022 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""

Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.

""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.

Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.

The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.

Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.

Netflix eyes price bump after actors strike: report

According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price bumps in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.

The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.

Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.





Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbers

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.

The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.

The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.

Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations & represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”

They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”

Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.

Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens grip

Starting recently, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.

The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.

Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.

2022-10-08, IANS,China’s smartphone market sees decline in 1st 8-month of 2022: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-smartphone-market-sees-decline-in-1st-8month-of-2022-report-3840911,"New Delhi, Oct 8 (IANS) The smartphone market in China has witnessed a decline in the first eight months of this year, manufacturing only 679 million devices from January to August, down 7.5 per cent from the same period in 2022, according to data published by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

As per Counterpoint Research, smartphone sales in the country also slowed down, falling 4 per cent (year on year) in the first eight months of 2022, reports South China Morning Post.

In the quarter to June, China's smartphone consumption fell to its lowest second-quarter sales figure since 2014, as macroeconomic headwinds weighed on consumer sentiment.

However, there is hope for improvement in the market’s outlook for the rest of 2022.

The upcoming winter sales season, as well as the release of new 5G smartphones by Huawei and Apple (NASDAQ: ), are expected to boost the industry.

Huawei's Mate 60 Pro series 5G handsets, in particular, have boosted the Chinese smartphone market's confidence, the report said.

According to Counterpoint, sales of Huawei's latest 5G smartphones will total between five and six million units by the end of the year.

Huawei's large domestic HarmonyOS user base is one factor contributing to this optimistic forecast. The company's new 5G devices are expected to attract new customers and entice former users who switched to other brands to return.

Huawei's smartphone sales increased 41 per cent in the first eight months of this year compared to the same period last year.

This upswing was primarily driven by large-cap tech stocks such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ). The surge in stocks came in the wake of successful negotiations with the autoworkers union.

While the stock market was bouncing back, yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries showed signs of calming after reaching near highs of 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively. This occurred amidst a global bond decline that has been ongoing for five consecutive weeks.

In labor market news, the nonfarm payrolls report indicated an accelerated pace of hiring with 336,000 jobs added in September, more than double what economists had estimated. Despite this positive development, the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.8%.

2022-10-06, Investing.com,Tech Giants See Premarket Shares Decline Following Strong September Jobs Report,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-see-premarket-shares-decline-following-strong-september-jobs-report-93CH-3839822,"The Magnificent 7 tech giants, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), witnessed a decline in their premarket trading shares on Friday. The downturn was triggered by a robust September jobs report, which exceeded expectations and reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve terminating its interest rate hike policy.

The stronger-than-expected jobs data has increased pressure on equity valuations, a factor that has been influencing the stock market for some time. This is because a strong labor market could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than previously anticipated, which could potentially make borrowing more expensive and slow down economic growth.

This downward trend was not confined to individual stocks but also impacted index trackers. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: ) and Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the , both reversed from initial gains to losses following the release of the jobs data. These ETFs are often seen as barometers for broader market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be reevaluating their positions in light of the latest economic indicators.

The Friday downturn comes amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties and concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves and any further economic data that could influence market trends.

Other categories like domestic stock funds, taxable bonds, and internationally oriented stock funds weren't spared either, witnessing declines of 3.5%, 1.1%, and 4.7%.

Tech giants Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) were among the most affected. Nvidia's shares fell nearly 12%, while Apple, contributing to a quarter of the S&P 500's decline, saw its shares drop by 11.7%. These figures were calculated by Birinyi Associates.

The Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates in an attempt to combat inflation was a significant factor behind these losses across stocks and bonds.

However, it wasn't all doom and gloom in the market. The energy sector saw some notable gains amid rising energy prices. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) enjoyed a surge of 9.6%, while Marathon Petroleum (NYSE: ) saw an impressive increase of 29.8%. This upward trend in energy stocks was not universal though, as Solar Edge suffered a substantial loss of 51.9%.

Interestingly, the higher fossil fuel prices turned out to be beneficial for certain funds. Despite the overall negative market performance, the Vanguard Energy Index Fund managed to capitalize on this situation, further highlighting the current volatility and sector-specific dynamics at play in the market.

In August 2022, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) launched a probe into Google Play and App Store for their enforcement of certain in-app payment methods and other irregularities against app developers.

Wrapping up the probe, the commission decided to impose a fine of 47.5 billion won on Google and 20.5 billion won on Apple based on the judgment that they violated the country's revised Telecommunications Business Act by abusing their monopoly power to force local publishers to use specific billing systems and unfairly postponing due app review, reports Yonhap news agency.

The commission also found that Apple's policy imposing fees for domestic app developers constitutes a discriminatory act.

The KCC called on the two companies to implement corrective measures, saying that their practices are a ""grave issue"" as it could highly likely hamper fair market competition.

The commission plans to finalise the fine after listening to the opinions of the companies and going through due deliberation procedures.

In 2021, the National Assembly passed a law that bans app store operators from forcing in-app payment systems on developers, making South Korea the first country in the world to introduce such curbs on in-app billing policies of Apple and Google.

""Since the start of the fact finding investigation in August 2022, we have worked closely with KCC to explain how we are complying with the new law whilst ensuring that through our alternative billing, we continue to provide a safe and high quality experience for all,"" Google said in a statement.

""What KCC has shared today is the 'pre-notice' and we will carefully review and submit our response. Once the final written decision is shared with us we will carefully review to evaluate the next course of action,"" it added.

Apple refuted the commission's conclusions, stressing that it has long worked closely with local app developers and played a role in building a sound local app ecosystem in South Korea.

""We disagree with the conclusions made by the KCC in their Examiner's Report, and believe the changes we have implemented to the App Store comply with the Telecommunications Business Act. As we have always done, we will continue to engage with the KCC to share our views,"" Apple said in a release.

""Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea's laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country's talented app developers, having helped build a vibrant local app ecosystem in the country that supports more than 18,000 developers with tools, resources, access to 175 storefronts globally, and a newly-opened Apple Developer Academy in Pohang,"" it added.

We miss you, Steve,” Cook said in a post on X on Thursday.

The post was accompanied by a portrait of Jobs who passed away on October 5, 2011, at the age of 56, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

A number of users also paid tribute to the Apple founder on his 12th death anniversary.

Steve Jobs is the one who inspired me to explore the technology world. It's the reason why I became a ux designer. I remember designing my first app in 2016 and learning the iOS ecosystem and Swift. He's truly a generational figure,"" a user wrote.

""What a legend! He was in touch with humanity and understanding how things work,"" another user said.

One more user mentioned: ""Steve was always an inspiration. He is greatly missed.""

Following Jobs' death, Apple hosted a ""Celebrating Steve"" event at its Infinite Loop campus, with speeches by Cook, Jony Ive, and others, according to 9to5Mac.

The Steve Jobs Archive, which serves as a time capsule of Jobs' life, debuted in September of last year.

The archive contains a curated collection of exhibits and publications that recognise his unwavering focus on the future by bringing his commitment to excellence and his epic sense of possibility to new generations.

The archive also debuted a book in April, entitled ""Make Something Wonderful"".

Wrapping up the probe, the commission decided to impose a fine of 47.5 billion won on Google and 20.5 billion won on Apple based on the judgment that they violated the country's revised Telecommunications Business Act by abusing their monopoly power to force local publishers to use their in-app billing system and unfairly postponing due evaluation of apps.

The commission also found that Apple's policy imposing fees for domestic app developers constitutes a discriminatory act.

The KCC called on the two companies to implement corrective measures, saying that their practices are a ""grave issue"" as it could highly likely hamper fair market competition.

The commission plans to finalise the fine after listening to the opinions of the companies and going through due deliberation procedures.

Last year, the National Assembly passed a law that bans app store operators from forcing in-app payment systems on developers, making South Korea the first country in the world to introduce such curbs on in-app billing policies of Apple and Google.

2022-10-05, The News Crypto,Stock-Exchange Platforms Bring Music Royalties as an Investable Asset Class to Everyone,https://in.investing.com/news/stockexchange-platforms-bring-music-royalties-as-an-investable-asset-class-to-everyone-3838384,"Music is often perceived as a form of entertainment, relaxation, and leisure. However, today the relationship between music and finance has become intricate with new platforms and emerging markets creating investment opportunities that both musicians and investors should be aware of. Generating income with music is now more exciting than ever.

Throughout history, music and business have always been interlinked. In order to live, musicians and composers need to find ways to make money from their compositions. Many centuries ago, classical artists would work under a patronage system with wealthy aristocrats or charge for music pieces commissioned for specific events.

Over time, this has evolved into a royalties system and incomes through merchandising and stadium concerts. This link between business and music has never been more true than over the past two decades, in more ways than any of us could have imagined.

One of the significant transformations in the music industry over the past three decades has been the appearance of streaming services. Platforms, such as Spotify, Apple (NASDAQ: ) Music, Soundcloud, and YouTube, have appeared and now offer an extensive variety of artists, songs, and podcasts to serve a worldwide audience. This solution offers a reliable source of income for established artists.

The advantages of these platforms are clear, they generate cash flow from individual streams, subscriptions from premium accounts, and advertisements. As a retail investor, one can also engage in this business model by investing in the stocks of streaming services like Spotify.

The question is: What do songs such as Justin Bieber’s “Purpose”, “Nobody Else” by Backstreet Boys, or Little Mix’s “Power” have in common? Well, every time you listen to or stream them, somebody is getting paid and it might as well be you! A recent trend is for renowned artists to sell their music rights to private equity companies like Blackstone (NYSE: ), and KKR Apollo, or stock-exchange platforms such as ANote Music.

The overall spending on music catalogues increased from 1.9 billion to 5.4 billion USD between 2020 and 2021. Music rights as an asset class have been traded since the creation of copyright laws, but they have never been available to retail investors to trade at scale. ANote wants to transform the music industry by unlocking access to this asset class, and by offering shares in music royalties of hit songs and popular artists from all eras on its platform via catalogues. The trading platform has successfully raised over €3.3 million to date, with nearly 90% of its investors enjoying profitability, boasting an average annual return exceeding 10%. Furthermore, the trading platform has disbursed over €500,000 in total royalties.

“Our goal is to unlock the hidden value in music for both investors and artists by creating Europe’s leading marketplace for music investments,” Marzio Schena, CEO of ANote Music told Investing.

So what’s in it for the parties involved? For artists, it allows getting a relatively large lump sum immediately instead of waiting for revenues gradually emerging from streaming or radio stations. For investors, it boils down to a simple diversification story. Investing in music catalogues provides a steady and consistent cash flow, and is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as fixed income or equity. Moreover, they may offer the additional advantage of being intellectual property and, thus, intangible assets.

Music is also not subject to the usual risky fluctuations of the financial markets. The most-heard hits of all time are truly timeless in that sense. A song that has sold millions of copies over the decades will most likely continue to be heard in the future and generate corresponding returns. These are therefore concrete assets with a proven track record. Such music catalogues ratings also often increase consistently. The music industry assumes annual net returns of between 5%-16%.

The music rights industry, traditionally, has been a walled garden, accessible only to a select few. The inherent complexities of music rights ownership and royalty collection have been major roadblocks for many. ANote’s platform allows music rights holders to auction fractional music royalty interests, artists gain both monetary benefits and retain their artistic freedom. For music enthusiasts, this platform is a golden opportunity to earn passive income from their favourite tracks’ royalties and for music creators, it’s a chance to monetize their art without compromising their creative integrity. This innovative approach enhances current global music business revenue streams and adds a multi-billion-dollar opportunity on top.

Marzio Schena, also added “Our mission is to make music even more valuable to even more people.”

Music may not only be deemed an attractive alternative investment but also indirectly affect the public by shifting market sentiments. Behavioural economists have also long advocated the use of psychology and human behaviour to explain the drivers of stock markets and how our behavioural biases and emotions affect our choices in financial markets."

August's figure was revised up to show job gains of 180,000 from the gain of 177,000 that was initially reported.

Waverock previously generated a return of 22.8% and ₹400 crore ($53 million) in dividends from tenants including tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and global clothing retailer Gap.

As a result, Apple stock traded 1.2% lower in early New York trading on Wednesday.

The downgrade call on Apple stock is based on several factors:

Valuation: AAPL is currently trading at near-all-time high multiples and carries a significant premium compared to historical levels and the . This valuation level raises concerns, the analysts write; U.S. Sales Challenges: There are expectations that U.S. sales of Apple products may face difficulties. This assessment is based on KeyBanc’s data, predictions about U.S. upgrade rates, and initial iPhone promotions by U.S. carriers, which are seen as restrictive; International Growth Expectations: The anticipation of a rapid acceleration in international growth may be overly optimistic, according to the analysis; and Full Estimates: From both top-line and bottom-line perspectives, it is believed that Apple's estimates appear to be fully valued.

“We believe in order to justify upside to AAPL shares, peak valuations need to be applied or its growth profile needs to inflect higher,” the analysts said in a client note.

Moreover, key regions like the Americas are likely to see “soft growth.”

“~37% of AAPL's revenue comes from the U.S., making the U.S. APPL's largest geographic segment. We expect the U.S. to experience its fourth consecutive y/y decline in F4Q23, potentially carrying into F1Q24,” they added.

KeyBanc projects FY24 revenue growth of 3.5%, while the Street consensus sits at >6%.

“We also expect margins to improve at a slower pace in the next couple of years given: 1) product introduction and mix shift; 2) incremental hardware and services contribution margin pressure; 3) higher R&D and S&M for new product launches; and 4) potential for higher capex,” the analysts concluded."

2022-10-04, IANS,Apple testing iOS 17.0.3 to fix overheating bug in iPhone 15 Pro,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-testing-ios-1703-to-fix-overheating-bug-in-iphone-15-pro-3835218,"New Delhi, Oct 4 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is internally testing the next iOS 17 update to fix overheating issues in iPhone 15 Pro phones which is likely to be available either later this week or next week.The iOS 17.0.3 will not reduce the performance of the A17 Pro chip, according to MacRumors.

The same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is currently in beta and is expected to be released in late October.

Not all iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many users have been impacted by the issue.

Apple has identified a few conditions which can cause new iPhones to run warmer than expected, including a bug in the iOS 17 software update and some third-party apps like Instagram.

The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity, the company said in a statement earlier this month.

“We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update,” the iPhone maker said.

The new titanium material on iPhone 15 Pro, paired with its aluminum substructure and new system design, result in better heat dissipation than any prior stainless steel Pro models.

iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max do not suffer from overheating due to their design, contrary to some reports.

Third-party apps that Apple is currently aware of that overload the CPU and cause the iPhone to run warmer than normal include Asphalt 9, Instagram and Uber.

Instagram already issued a fix on September 27 (v302) to address its issue.

However, China’s manufacturing and supply chain will still maintain its essential role in the longer run,” said senior research analyst Ivan Lam.

In a fillip to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, India saw mobile phones exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the ongoing fiscal year (FY24), government and industry data showed recently.

As per the estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year, with Apple (NASDAQ: ) leading the market with more than 50 per cent in FY24.

Meanwhile, according to the report, smartphone shipments from original design manufacturers (ODMs) and Independent Design Houses (ODMs/IDHs) declined six per cent (year-on-year) in the first half this year, according to the report.

“The YoY decline in ODM/IDH companies’ H1 2022 shipments was driven by Samsung (KS: ), Xiaomi and Lenovo Group’s weak performance. However, Vivo, HONOR and Transsion Group’s rise offset part of the decline,” said senior research analyst Shenghao Bai.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Apple is implementing changes to its App Store rules as China tightens grip,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-is-implementing-changes-to-its-app-store-rules-as-china-tightens-grip-432SI-3833775,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has implemented a new requirement for app developers wishing to release their apps on the China App Store, Reuters reported Tuesday.

Starting recently, Apple now mandates that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform. This move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

The requirement specifically asks app developers to submit an ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" when publishing new apps on the App Store in China. The ICP filing is a well-established registration system in China, necessary for websites to operate legally within the country.

Many local app stores, including those operated by Tencent (HK: ) and Huawei, have adhered to this requirement since at least 2017.

Obtaining an ICP filing license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher. This requirement has posed challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals. This approach contributed to Apple's popularity in China, which is its third-largest market, following the Americas and Europe.

This change in Apple's policy is a response to China's increased regulatory scrutiny of mobile apps. In August, China introduced a new rule mandating that all app stores and app developers submit an ""app filing"" containing business details to regulators."
2022-10-03, Investing.com,Alphabet's search division faces antitrust allegations over default search engine monopoly,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabets-search-division-faces-antitrust-allegations-over-default-search-engine-monopoly-93CH-3833510,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s search division, Google, is currently under scrutiny in a US antitrust trial. The company is accused of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless carriers to ensure its search engine remains the default option on mobile devices and web browsers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is leading the charge against Google, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). CEO Satya Nadella testifying on Monday.

Nadella dismissed Google's assertion that it is easy for users to change default search engine settings on mobile devices. He described the notion of choice in the search market as ""bogus,"" stating that Microsoft's efforts to make Bing the default search engine on iPhones encountered numerous roadblocks.

Last week, Jonathan Tinter, Microsoft's business development executive, testified that despite offering more favorable terms than Google and being willing to incur significant losses, Microsoft failed to secure a deal to make Bing the default search app on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s products. Instead, Apple renewed its agreement with Google. Tinter also revealed that Microsoft's Surface Duo smartphone was obligated to use Google search as part of its Android mobile operating system license agreement, limiting its ability to use Bing.

Nadella, who played a key role in developing Bing, testified about Microsoft's struggle to break into the online advertising market dominated by Google. Despite Bing gaining some ground on desktop computers through integration with Microsoft's Internet Explorer and later Edge browser, it has struggled on mobile devices where users predominantly use Google. Nadella stated: ""It's a hard game to make any breakthroughs, but no one can accuse us of not being persistent.""

The US government argues that Google has engaged in illegal payments of $10 billion annually to entities like Apple and wireless service providers such as AT&T (NYSE: ) to secure its position as the default search engine on their devices. Google, which controls approximately 90% of the search market and is valued at over $1 trillion, has denied these allegations. The company maintains that its dominance in the lucrative advertising sector is a result of product quality, not illegal practices.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Microsoft's struggle to compete with Google in search market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-struggle-to-compete-with-google-in-search-market-dominance-93CH-3833453,"The ongoing antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has brought to light the struggle of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: ) Bing search engine to compete with Google's dominance in the market. The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, testified on Monday, shedding light on the company's efforts and challenges.

Despite investing $100 billion into Bing, Nadella acknowledged its position as a ""very, very low share player"" in the search market. He explained that Microsoft continues to persist with Bing because they view it as a software category they can contribute to, even though it has been challenging to make significant breakthroughs.

Adding to the complexity of the competition is the role of artificial intelligence (AI). Google began incorporating its AI software, Bard, into its search engine in March. Nadella stated that Google could extend its lead by using the substantial profits from its search business to secure exclusive rights to content that could enhance its search AI, thereby outperforming rivals.

The U.S. Department of Justice accuses Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) search division of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to ensure that its search engine remains the default option. Google denies these allegations. The government is using Microsoft's struggle with Bing as evidence that even with substantial resources, it is difficult to challenge Google's dominance.

Nadella also revealed that Microsoft was unable to secure a deal to make Bing the default search engine on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) products, despite reportedly offering better terms than Google. Furthermore, Microsoft's own phone is required to use Google search due to licensing agreements with the Android mobile operating system.

The CEO of Microsoft also testified about the significant influence Apple's selection of its default search engine holds. He stated that Microsoft was open to obscuring Bing's brand on Apple devices to unseat Google from its default search engine status. Despite making progress between 2013 and 2017, when Apple opted to replace Google as the search engine for Siri and the Spotlight feature, Apple ultimately reverted to Google for the default search engine in its Safari web browser.

During a testimony in the landmark US vs Google antitrust trial late on Monday, Nadella said that he sees search as the largest software category out there by far, reports The Verge.

""I used to think of Windows and Office as attractive businesses until I saw the search,"" he said during the testimony.

He said that Microsoft was prepared to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) all of the economic upside of the deal if Apple were to switch to Bing, and ""he was prepared to lose up to $15 billion a year in the process"".

Nadella said he was willing to hide the Bing brand in Apple users' search engines and respect any of the company's privacy wishes. ""Defaults are the only thing that matter, in terms of changing user behaviour,"" he was quoted as saying.

For Nadella, becoming Apple’s default search engine wouldn't be about the money, at least not directly.

""We needed to be less greedy and more competitive,"" he said during the testimony.

Asked if Microsoft tried to become Apple’s default search engine, Nadella said yes but the effort did not go well. Not only are the economics of the Google deal hugely favourable for Apple, he said, but Apple may also be afraid of what Google would do if it lost default status, according to the report.

Google also has immensely popular services like Gmail and YouTube. Nadella said AI has the potential to shake up the market a bit but he also believes it could ""further entrench Google’s dominance"".

The US Justice Department alleges that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Apple works to resolve iPhone 15 overheating issues tied to software bug and apps,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-works-to-resolve-iphone-15-overheating-issues-tied-to-software-bug-and-apps-93CH-3833013,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the Cupertino-based tech giant, has acknowledged that a software bug and issues with popular apps like Instagram and Uber (NYSE: ) have been causing its recently released iPhone 15 models to overheat. The news came to light on Saturday, following various complaints from users that the phones were uncomfortably hot to handle.

Apple stated it is working on an update for iOS17, the operating system powering the entire iPhone 15 lineup, aiming to alleviate the overheating issue and manage apps causing system overload. Earlier in the week, Meta-owned Instagram had adjusted its app to prevent it from excessively heating up the phone on the latest operating system. As for Uber and other apps such as the video game Asphalt 9, updates are still being rolled out.

The company has not yet provided a timeline for its own software patch release but assured that no security issues would prevent iPhone 15 owners from using their devices while awaiting the update. ""We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,"" Apple stated in response to media reports of overheating complaints appearing on online message boards.

Apple also clarified that the overheating problem in the new models was not related to changes in charging hardware. The company recently switched from its proprietary Lightning charging cable to a more widely used USB-C port, in compliance with European Union regulations.

While Apple remains confident that the overheating issue can be swiftly resolved through upcoming software updates, this problem has emerged at a challenging time for the company. Apple has reported three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in overall sales, partly due to a slowdown in iPhone sales. According to InvestingPro Data, the revenue growth for Apple in the last twelve months till the third quarter of 2022 was -0.93%. In the last three fiscal quarters, iPhone sales have fallen by a total of 4% compared to the previous year.

Apple has dismissed speculation linking the overheating issue with changes in housing materials for its new models. The company emphasized that the problem was not related to the new titanium casing used for the iPhone 15 models, as opposed to the stainless steel used on older smartphones.

However, it's important to note that despite these challenges, Apple has shown resilience. According to InvestingPro Tips, the company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years. Moreover, Apple has been profitable over the last twelve months and the company's management has been aggressively buying back shares, reflecting their confidence in the company's future prospects.

The group, which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is currently trading at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.3, compared to 1.9 for the median stock. This marks the most significant discount since January 2017.

Despite a challenging year marked by rising interest rates and growing concerns about Federal Reserve policy, these tech giants have demonstrated resilience. Notably, shares of Nvidia have more than tripled since the beginning of the year, while Meta Platforms and Tesla shares have more than doubled. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google shares have risen roughly 50%, with Apple and Microsoft up more than a third.

This performance contrasts with last year's bear market when tech stocks led the declines. However, thanks to consistent earnings growth and the artificial intelligence revolution, tech stocks have become some of the market's biggest gainers this year, despite soaring interest rates.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their research note that the divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors. They anticipate an additional boost for these tech giants during the Q3 earnings period, as profit upgrades are expected to outnumber downgrades.

Despite this optimistic outlook, not all analysts share Goldman Sachs' bullish stance. RBC Capital expects weakness in US stocks to continue, citing data from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed a steep drop in net bullishness since mid-August.

Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs remains confident about the prospects of the US stock market. The firm now expects the S&P 500 to end 2022 at around 4,500 points, implying a potential upside of approximately 5% compared to current levels. This optimistic forecast is partly driven by expectations of falling Treasury yields, which could provide a boost to these mega-cap tech stocks.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Apple to Appeal Dutch Regulator’s Decision in Ongoing App Store Dispute,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-appeal-dutch-regulators-decision-in-ongoing-app-store-dispute-93CH-3832876,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is set to challenge a decision made by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) in its ongoing legal battles over App Store policies. This move follows the publication of a decision on July 13, 2022, in which the ACM rejected an administrative appeal made by Apple.

The tech giant had been fined EUR50 million by the ACM in August 2021 due to its dominance in the App Store. Despite Apple making adjustments to two conditions and allowing alternative payment methods in dating apps, it failed to meet a third undisclosed condition set by the regulator.

The ACM maintained its stance, arguing that its order was designed to protect investment incentives as well as user privacy and data security. The regulator's refusal to budge on this matter prompted Apple's announcement of plans to appeal to the Netherlands courts.

The forthcoming appeal marks a new chapter in Apple's ongoing legal confrontations concerning its App Store policies, with implications for tech companies and their control over digital marketplaces.

In the midst of these legal battles, Apple's performance in the market remains robust. According to InvestingPro data, the company's Market Cap stands at a staggering 2720.0B USD. The P/E Ratio is 29.01, indicating investors are willing to pay a high price for the company's earnings. Furthermore, Apple's revenue for LTM2022.Q3 is reported at 383.93B USD.

Despite a minor decline in revenue growth by -0.93%, Apple's Gross Profit Margin LTM2022.Q3 stands at an impressive 43.45%. The company's Return on Assets is also substantial at 28.23%, demonstrating effective management in generating profit from its assets.

InvestingPro Tips also shed light on Apple's financial health. The company has consistently raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, and strong earnings should allow management to continue these dividend payments. Moreover, Apple operates with a high return on assets, and the stock generally trades with low price volatility, making it a potentially reliable investment.

For those interested in more detailed analysis and insights, additional InvestingPro Tips are available, offering a comprehensive understanding of Apple's financial standing. For instance, did you know that Apple has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years or that it operates with a moderate level of debt?

Stocks in focus are mega-caps Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

The strategists highlight that the group collectively accounts for 27% of the . While sales and earnings expectations for the biggest tech stocks have seen upward revisions since August began, this group has lagged behind the other 493 S&P 500 companies by 4 percentage points during this period, with a performance of -7% compared to -3%.

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists and rates strategists anticipate that yields will decrease to 4.3% in the fourth quarter but will reach a peak of 4.6% in the first half of 2024, eventually settling back to 4.3% by the end of that year. If yields remain contained in 2024 at these levels, it would imply that most of the de-rating has already occurred.

""The divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors: On a growth-adjusted basis, the mega caps trade at the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock in over six years,"" the strategists commented.

Further, historical patterns indicate that the upcoming third-quarter results could potentially trigger a shift in momentum for the largest tech stocks. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, these mega-cap stocks have exceeded consensus sales growth expectations in 81% of instances and have outperformed during about two-thirds of earnings seasons, typically by a margin of 3 percentage points."

Wednesday's positive news on the labor market was in contrast to a stronger-than-expected report on job openings on Tuesday, which sent Wall Street's three main indexes lower for the day as bond yields surged. Yields typically move inversely to prices.

U.S. private sector adds fewer-than-expected roles

The U.S. private sector added far smaller-than-forecast 89,000 jobs in September, according to a by payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, in what was the slowest pace of growth since January 2021, when private employers shed jobs.

Economists had expected the private sector to have added 153,000 jobs last month.

August's figure was revised up to show job gains of 180,000 from the gain of 177,000 that was initially reported. September's steep decline may indicate that the job market in the world's largest economy is beginning to weaken, a trend that could relieve upward pressure on wages, help cool inflation, and give the Federal Reserve more headroom to back away from further policy tightening.

The all-important monthly report at the end of the trading week will likely flesh out the jobs picture. The U.S. economy is expected to have added 163,000 jobs last month, slipping from 187,000 in August.

The asset was acquired from SPREF II Pte, a joint venture between Allianz (ETR: ) and Shapoorji Pallonji.

Waverock previously generated a return of 22.8% and ₹400 crore ($53 million) in dividends from tenants including tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and global clothing retailer Gap. The commercial property acquisition is seen as a reflection of GIC's optimism about the growth potential of India's office market.

SPREF II Pte, the previous owner of the Waverock property, had secured a $500 million commitment from investors such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The successful transfer of ownership to GIC underscores the continued interest in India's commercial real estate sector.

GIC's bullish stance on India's office market is further demonstrated by its partnership with Brookfield India REIT. This relationship is expected to bolster GIC's presence in the Indian office sector, which is anticipated to grow due to increased digital adoption across various industries.

The analysts expressed their skepticism about the Wall Street consensus of international market growth for Apple, pointing to stagnant user growth. They also cited the disappointing results of Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter, weak credit/debit card spending data, and soft U.S. carrier sales as reasons for the downgrade.

The company's stock trades at peak multiples of enterprise value versus operating profitability and free cash flow, a significant premium to the . The analysts warned investors off Apple Inc., suggesting that the stock's 0.9% premarket plunge on Wednesday could signal a fifth weekly drop if it closes under $171.21 on Friday. This is despite the fact that Apple has a P/E ratio of 28.74 and an adjusted P/E ratio for LTM2022.Q3 of 29.05, as per InvestingPro data.

After maintaining an overweight rating for two years, the analysts' downgrade reflects growing investor concern over Apple's high valuation and potential sales slump in the U.S. market. Yet, Apple's strong earnings have allowed it to continue dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, and the company has even raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, as highlighted by InvestingPro Tips. This, along with the fact that Apple operates with a moderate level of debt and its cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, could be reassuring for investors.

As a result, Apple stock traded 1.2% lower in early New York trading on Wednesday.

The downgrade call on Apple stock is based on several factors:

Valuation: AAPL is currently trading at near-all-time high multiples and carries a significant premium compared to historical levels and the . This valuation level raises concerns, the analysts write; U.S. Sales Challenges: There are expectations that U.S. sales of Apple products may face difficulties. This assessment is based on KeyBanc’s data, predictions about U.S. upgrade rates, and initial iPhone promotions by U.S. carriers, which are seen as restrictive; International Growth Expectations: The anticipation of a rapid acceleration in international growth may be overly optimistic, according to the analysis; and Full Estimates: From both top-line and bottom-line perspectives, it is believed that Apple's estimates appear to be fully valued.

“We believe in order to justify upside to AAPL shares, peak valuations need to be applied or its growth profile needs to inflect higher,” the analysts said in a client note.

Moreover, key regions like the Americas are likely to see “soft growth.”

“~37% of AAPL's revenue comes from the U.S., making the U.S. APPL's largest geographic segment. We expect the U.S. to experience its fourth consecutive y/y decline in F4Q23, potentially carrying into F1Q24,” they added.

KeyBanc projects FY24 revenue growth of 3.5%, while the Street consensus sits at >6%.

“We also expect margins to improve at a slower pace in the next couple of years given: 1) product introduction and mix shift; 2) incremental hardware and services contribution margin pressure; 3) higher R&D and S&M for new product launches; and 4) potential for higher capex,” the analysts concluded."

The same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is currently in beta and is expected to be released in late October.

Not all iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many users have been impacted by the issue.

Apple has identified a few conditions which can cause new iPhones to run warmer than expected, including a bug in the iOS 17 software update and some third-party apps like Instagram.

The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity, the company said in a statement earlier this month.

“We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update,” the iPhone maker said.

The new titanium material on iPhone 15 Pro, paired with its aluminum substructure and new system design, result in better heat dissipation than any prior stainless steel Pro models.

iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max do not suffer from overheating due to their design, contrary to some reports.

Third-party apps that Apple is currently aware of that overload the CPU and cause the iPhone to run warmer than normal include Asphalt 9, Instagram and Uber.

Instagram already issued a fix on September 27 (v302) to address its issue.

However, China’s manufacturing and supply chain will still maintain its essential role in the longer run,” said senior research analyst Ivan Lam.

In a fillip to the ‘Make in India’ initiative, India saw mobile phones exports worth $5.5 billion (over Rs 45,000 crore) in the April-August period in the ongoing fiscal year (FY24), government and industry data showed recently.

As per the estimates by the Department of Commerce and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the April-August period saw mobile phone exports worth $5.5 billion, against $3 billion (about Rs 25,000 crore) in the same period in FY22-23.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Apple is implementing changes to its App Store rules as China tightens grip,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-is-implementing-changes-to-its-app-store-rules-as-china-tightens-grip-432SI-3833775,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has implemented a new requirement for app developers wishing to release their apps on the China App Store, Reuters reported Tuesday.

Starting recently, Apple now mandates that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform. This move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

The requirement specifically asks app developers to submit an ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" when publishing new apps on the App Store in China. The ICP filing is a well-established registration system in China, necessary for websites to operate legally within the country.

Many local app stores, including those operated by Tencent (HK: ) and Huawei, have adhered to this requirement since at least 2017.

Obtaining an ICP filing license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher. This requirement has posed challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals. This approach contributed to Apple's popularity in China, which is its third-largest market, following the Americas and Europe.

This change in Apple's policy is a response to China's increased regulatory scrutiny of mobile apps. In August, China introduced a new rule mandating that all app stores and app developers submit an ""app filing"" containing business details to regulators."
2022-10-03, Investing.com,Alphabet's search division faces antitrust allegations over default search engine monopoly,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabets-search-division-faces-antitrust-allegations-over-default-search-engine-monopoly-93CH-3833510,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s search division, Google, is currently under scrutiny in a US antitrust trial. The company is accused of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless carriers to ensure its search engine remains the default option on mobile devices and web browsers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is leading the charge against Google, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). CEO Satya Nadella testifying on Monday.

Nadella dismissed Google's assertion that it is easy for users to change default search engine settings on mobile devices. He described the notion of choice in the search market as ""bogus,"" stating that Microsoft's efforts to make Bing the default search engine on iPhones encountered numerous roadblocks.

Last week, Jonathan Tinter, Microsoft's business development executive, testified that despite offering more favorable terms than Google and being willing to incur significant losses, Microsoft failed to secure a deal to make Bing the default search app on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s products. Instead, Apple renewed its agreement with Google. Tinter also revealed that Microsoft's Surface Duo smartphone was obligated to use Google search as part of its Android mobile operating system license agreement, limiting its ability to use Bing.

Nadella, who played a key role in developing Bing, testified about Microsoft's struggle to break into the online advertising market dominated by Google. Despite Bing gaining some ground on desktop computers through integration with Microsoft's Internet Explorer and later Edge browser, it has struggled on mobile devices where users predominantly use Google. Nadella stated: ""It's a hard game to make any breakthroughs, but no one can accuse us of not being persistent.""

The US government argues that Google has engaged in illegal payments of $10 billion annually to entities like Apple and wireless service providers such as AT&T (NYSE: ) to secure its position as the default search engine on their devices. Google, which controls approximately 90% of the search market and is valued at over $1 trillion, has denied these allegations. The company maintains that its dominance in the lucrative advertising sector is a result of product quality, not illegal practices.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Microsoft's struggle to compete with Google in search market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-struggle-to-compete-with-google-in-search-market-dominance-93CH-3833453,"The ongoing antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has brought to light the struggle of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: ) Bing search engine to compete with Google's dominance in the market. The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, testified on Monday, shedding light on the company's efforts and challenges.

Despite investing $100 billion into Bing, Nadella acknowledged its position as a ""very, very low share player"" in the search market. He explained that Microsoft continues to persist with Bing because they view it as a software category they can contribute to, even though it has been challenging to make significant breakthroughs.

Adding to the complexity of the competition is the role of artificial intelligence (AI). Google began incorporating its AI software, Bard, into its search engine in March. Nadella stated that Google could extend its lead by using the substantial profits from its search business to secure exclusive rights to content that could enhance its search AI, thereby outperforming rivals.

The U.S. Department of Justice accuses Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) search division of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to ensure that its search engine remains the default option. Google denies these allegations. The government is using Microsoft's struggle with Bing as evidence that even with substantial resources, it is difficult to challenge Google's dominance.

Nadella also revealed that Microsoft was unable to secure a deal to make Bing the default search engine on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) products, despite reportedly offering better terms than Google. Furthermore, Microsoft's own phone is required to use Google search due to licensing agreements with the Android mobile operating system.

The CEO of Microsoft also testified about the significant influence Apple's selection of its default search engine holds. He stated that Microsoft was open to obscuring Bing's brand on Apple devices to unseat Google from its default search engine status. Despite making progress between 2013 and 2017, when Apple opted to replace Google as the search engine for Siri and the Spotlight feature, Apple ultimately reverted to Google for the default search engine in its Safari web browser.

2022-10-03, IANS,Bing not good as Google Search and Apple could fix this: Satya Nadella,https://in.investing.com/news/bing-not-good-as-google-search-and-apple-could-fix-this-satya-nadella-3833366,"Washington, Oct 3 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the company's Bing search engine is not as good as Google (NASDAQ: ), and becoming Apple’s default search engine could actually help Bing grow in the global search market. During a testimony in the landmark US vs Google antitrust trial late on Monday, Nadella said that he sees search as the largest software category out there by far, reports The Verge.

""I used to think of Windows and Office as attractive businesses until I saw the search,"" he said during the testimony.

He said that Microsoft was prepared to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) all of the economic upside of the deal if Apple were to switch to Bing, and ""he was prepared to lose up to $15 billion a year in the process"".

Nadella said he was willing to hide the Bing brand in Apple users' search engines and respect any of the company's privacy wishes. ""Defaults are the only thing that matter, in terms of changing user behaviour,"" he was quoted as saying.

For Nadella, becoming Apple’s default search engine wouldn't be about the money, at least not directly.

""We needed to be less greedy and more competitive,"" he said during the testimony.

Asked if Microsoft tried to become Apple’s default search engine, Nadella said yes but the effort did not go well. Not only are the economics of the Google deal hugely favourable for Apple, he said, but Apple may also be afraid of what Google would do if it lost default status, according to the report.

Google also has immensely popular services like Gmail and YouTube. Nadella said AI has the potential to shake up the market a bit but he also believes it could ""further entrench Google’s dominance"".

The US Justice Department alleges that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Apple works to resolve iPhone 15 overheating issues tied to software bug and apps,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-works-to-resolve-iphone-15-overheating-issues-tied-to-software-bug-and-apps-93CH-3833013,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., the Cupertino-based tech giant, has acknowledged that a software bug and issues with popular apps like Instagram and Uber (NYSE: ) have been causing its recently released iPhone 15 models to overheat. The news came to light on Saturday, following various complaints from users that the phones were uncomfortably hot to handle.

Apple stated it is working on an update for iOS17, the operating system powering the entire iPhone 15 lineup, aiming to alleviate the overheating issue and manage apps causing system overload. Earlier in the week, Meta-owned Instagram had adjusted its app to prevent it from excessively heating up the phone on the latest operating system. As for Uber and other apps such as the video game Asphalt 9, updates are still being rolled out.

The company has not yet provided a timeline for its own software patch release but assured that no security issues would prevent iPhone 15 owners from using their devices while awaiting the update. ""We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected,"" Apple stated in response to media reports of overheating complaints appearing on online message boards.

Apple also clarified that the overheating problem in the new models was not related to changes in charging hardware. The company recently switched from its proprietary Lightning charging cable to a more widely used USB-C port, in compliance with European Union regulations.

While Apple remains confident that the overheating issue can be swiftly resolved through upcoming software updates, this problem has emerged at a challenging time for the company. Apple has reported three consecutive quarters of year-on-year declines in overall sales, partly due to a slowdown in iPhone sales. According to InvestingPro Data, the revenue growth for Apple in the last twelve months till the third quarter of 2022 was -0.93%. In the last three fiscal quarters, iPhone sales have fallen by a total of 4% compared to the previous year.

Apple has dismissed speculation linking the overheating issue with changes in housing materials for its new models. The company emphasized that the problem was not related to the new titanium casing used for the iPhone 15 models, as opposed to the stainless steel used on older smartphones.

However, it's important to note that despite these challenges, Apple has shown resilience. According to InvestingPro Tips, the company has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years and has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years. Moreover, Apple has been profitable over the last twelve months and the company's management has been aggressively buying back shares, reflecting their confidence in the company's future prospects.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,,https://in.investing.com/news/magnificent-seven-tech-stocks-primed-for-turnaround-goldman-sachs-suggests-93CH-3832980,"The seven largest US tech stocks, colloquially known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" are trading at notably discounted valuations and could be poised for a turnaround, according to new analysis by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ). The group, which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is currently trading at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.3, compared to 1.9 for the median stock. This marks the most significant discount since January 2017.

Despite a challenging year marked by rising interest rates and growing concerns about Federal Reserve policy, these tech giants have demonstrated resilience. Notably, shares of Nvidia have more than tripled since the beginning of the year, while Meta Platforms and Tesla shares have more than doubled. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google shares have risen roughly 50%, with Apple and Microsoft up more than a third.

This performance contrasts with last year's bear market when tech stocks led the declines. However, thanks to consistent earnings growth and the artificial intelligence revolution, tech stocks have become some of the market's biggest gainers this year, despite soaring interest rates.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their research note that the divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors. They anticipate an additional boost for these tech giants during the Q3 earnings period, as profit upgrades are expected to outnumber downgrades.

Despite this optimistic outlook, not all analysts share Goldman Sachs' bullish stance. RBC Capital expects weakness in US stocks to continue, citing data from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed a steep drop in net bullishness since mid-August.

Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs remains confident about the prospects of the US stock market. The firm now expects the S&P 500 to end 2022 at around 4,500 points, implying a potential upside of approximately 5% compared to current levels. This optimistic forecast is partly driven by expectations of falling Treasury yields, which could provide a boost to these mega-cap tech stocks.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Apple to Appeal Dutch Regulator’s Decision in Ongoing App Store Dispute,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-appeal-dutch-regulators-decision-in-ongoing-app-store-dispute-93CH-3832876,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is set to challenge a decision made by the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) in its ongoing legal battles over App Store policies. This move follows the publication of a decision on July 13, 2022, in which the ACM rejected an administrative appeal made by Apple.

The tech giant had been fined EUR50 million by the ACM in August 2021 due to its dominance in the App Store. Despite Apple making adjustments to two conditions and allowing alternative payment methods in dating apps, it failed to meet a third undisclosed condition set by the regulator.

The ACM maintained its stance, arguing that its order was designed to protect investment incentives as well as user privacy and data security. The regulator's refusal to budge on this matter prompted Apple's announcement of plans to appeal to the Netherlands courts.

The forthcoming appeal marks a new chapter in Apple's ongoing legal confrontations concerning its App Store policies, with implications for tech companies and their control over digital marketplaces.

In the midst of these legal battles, Apple's performance in the market remains robust. According to InvestingPro data, the company's Market Cap stands at a staggering 2720.0B USD. The P/E Ratio is 29.01, indicating investors are willing to pay a high price for the company's earnings. Furthermore, Apple's revenue for LTM2022.Q3 is reported at 383.93B USD.

Despite a minor decline in revenue growth by -0.93%, Apple's Gross Profit Margin LTM2022.Q3 stands at an impressive 43.45%. The company's Return on Assets is also substantial at 28.23%, demonstrating effective management in generating profit from its assets.

InvestingPro Tips also shed light on Apple's financial health. The company has consistently raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, and strong earnings should allow management to continue these dividend payments. Moreover, Apple operates with a high return on assets, and the stock generally trades with low price volatility, making it a potentially reliable investment.

For those interested in more detailed analysis and insights, additional InvestingPro Tips are available, offering a comprehensive understanding of Apple's financial standing. For instance, did you know that Apple has maintained dividend payments for 12 consecutive years or that it operates with a moderate level of debt?

As the appeal unfolds, investors will be keenly watching how this legal development impacts Apple's market performance.

2022-10-01, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3831542,"Investing.com -- With an eleventh-hour deal reached to avert a U.S. government shutdown investors will be focusing on U.S. jobs data and speeches by Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in the week ahead. Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

Analysts cheered by Meta's freshest AI innovations

Wall Street analysts are positive on Meta (NASDAQ: ) after the company unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) features and showcased its latest range of head-worn devices at its annual “Connect” developers conference this past week.

The new products include AI-enabled Ray-Ban smart glasses that can livestream what a user is seeing directly to Facebook and Instagram, as well as a newly updated virtual-reality headset. The company also presented a new AI chatbot and a studio for developers to create brand-specific chatbots.

Analysts are particularly optimistic about the AI potential.

Oppenheimer wrote that the updates show that the company ""understands investors want more focus on AI vs. the Metaverse,"" reiterating its Outperform rating on the company, and Evercore analysts said of the smart glasses: ""All in, this is a solid update, and we believe an important step towards mass adoption of AR/VR technology.""

UBS said it was ""positively surprised by the level of innovation going on at Meta, the series of products likely to boost engagement, and a clear path to medium-term monetization potential of genAI products.""

And Bank of America (NYSE: ) said the event ""offered early signs on how Meta will use AI to help drive user engagement (chat and image creation) and new business services,"" adding, ""We expect a number of AI based advertiser tools to help with ad creation and campaign management as well.”

Meta shares gained 1.6% for the week to $300.21.

Amazon accused of wielding 'monopoly power' by FTC in new antitrust lawsuit; invests in ChatGPT rival

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) took a fall Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant, but some analysts have maintained their positive outlook on the company.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of the lawsuit.

CFRA likewise maintained its Buy rating on Amazon and said it believes the lawsuit ""will be a lengthy and uphill battle for the FTC."" Along with Wedbush, it believes major structural changes in the company are unlikely. Wedbush added, ""Consistent with our view ahead of the lawsuit’s filing, we would be buyers of the pullback in shares.""

Amazon ultimately recovered some of its Tuesday losses and ended down 1.8% for the week to $127.12.

Separately, Amazon also announced in the past week that it is aiming to invest up to $4B in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, rival to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, aiming to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon says an initial investment of $1.25B could expand to $4B depending on certain conditions. Anthropic will then have access to Amazon's cloud computing platform to help optimize its AI systems, known as large language models.





Micron loses ground on shaky outlook

Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported Wednesday better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter , but a mixed picture on the outlook for the first quarter amid a challenging backdrop as the chip supply glut continued to keep a lid on demand.

Micron reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 a share, $0.08 better than anticipated, on above-par revenue of $4.01 billion.

For the fiscal first quarter, however, the company guided for a loss in a range of $1 to $1.14 a share versus consensus for $0.92 in the red, and revenue of $4.2B to $4.6B that comes in well below the $4.22B consensus.

JPMorgan raised the price target by $5 to $80 per share on MU, maintaining its Overweight rating, citing the beginning of an ""upturn"" in the memory industry and saying it believes Micron shares will rise through the rest of the year and into next ""as the market continues to discount improving revenue/pricing/margin/earnings power.""

Goldman Sachs commented in a similar manner:

""Despite what now appears to be a slower than previously expected recovery in gross margins and EPS, our constructive thesis on the stock predicated on improving demand and supply discipline (i.e. reduction in Wafer Fab Equipment spending and wafer starts) remains unchanged and, as such, we would view any pullback in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.""

Shares lost 4.4% on Thursday after the report, but clawed back those losses on Friday and ended down just fractionally for the week to $68.03.

Apple iPhones overheating: report

The new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The concerns, which echo similar ones for iPhone14 Pro, have been raised in consumer social media posts as well as reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ - the latter of which showed the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging, and up to 112 degrees (44C), when charging coincides with processor-intensive activities such as gaming.

Apple may need to address these overheating issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

2022-10-01, IANS,"Apple blames iOS 17 bug, apps like Instagram for making new iPhones run warmer",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-blames-ios-17-bug-apps-like-instagram-for-making-new-iphones-run-warmer-3831391,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Sunday said it has identified a few conditions which can cause new iPhones to run warmer than expected, including a bug in the iOS 17 software update and some third-party apps like Instagram.The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity, the company said in a statement.

“We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update,” the iPhone maker said.

The new titanium material on iPhone 15 Pro, paired with its aluminum substructure and new system design, result in better heat dissipation than any prior stainless steel Pro models.

iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max do not suffer from overheating due to their design, contrary to some reports. Apple said that another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system.

“We’re working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out,” said the company.

Third-party apps that Apple is currently aware of that overload the CPU and cause the iPhone to run warmer than normal include Asphalt 9, Instagram and Uber.

The tech giant will continue to investigate to see if there are others and work with those developers to implement fixes.

Instagram already issued a fix on September 27 (v302) to address its issue.

However, the bug fix coming in iOS 17 does not involve reducing performance to address iPhone temperature.

The new iPhones feel warmer when users set up their devices for the first time, restore from a backup, wirelessly charge their device, use graphics-intensive or processor-intensive apps, games, or features, including augmented-reality apps; and/or stream high-quality video.

These conditions are normal, and the device will return to a regular temperature when the process is complete or when a user finishes their activity.

If a user's device doesn't display a temperature warning, they can keep using their device.

Those who use a larger USB-C power adapter (20W +) should expect iPhone temperature to temporarily increase while fast charging, according to the company.

The iPhone still regulates power into the device at up to 27W so long as the adapter is compliant with the USB-C PD (Power Delivery) standard.

This temporary increase in temperature will not impact the long term performance of the iPhone and is not a safety or injury risk.

2022-09-30, IANS,Warning signs suggest this year’s Wall Street rally is on shaky legs,https://in.investing.com/news/warning-signs-suggest-this-years-wall-street-rally-is-on-shaky-legs-3831091,"New York, Sep 30 (IANS) Stocks rebounded this year after a bruising 2022, as artificial intelligence excitement led investors to fuel a powerful tech-driven surge. Seemingly abating inflation also raised hopes on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would soon curb its interest rate hiking cycle, helping equities edge higher, media reports said.Now, markets aren’t looking so picturesque. The economy’s resilience against numerous interest rate hikes, a tick up in inflation data this month, and the Fed’s indication that it could raise rates once more this year and keep them higher for longer than expected has started to chip away at the market’s gains, CNN reported.

While the benchmark is not in correction territory, defined in this case as a 10 per cent fall from its most recent peak on July 31, that means stocks have more room to fall, says Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi (NASDAQ: ).

""There’s more risk to the downside, at least in the near term,"" said Young, CNN reported.

While shares of tech behemoths have led the market’s surge this year, the rally had begun to broaden out in early summer.

But it's since narrowed over the past few months. The percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 index trading above their 200-day moving averages, a commonly watched indicator of market breadth, fell this week to its lowest level since March.

A narrow rally doesn’t bode well for the market’s health, since having just a small share of stocks holding it up means that it’s more susceptible to a downturn. This year, shares of tech giants have been responsible for the lion’s share of the market’s run — but even those have taken a hit in recent weeks. Nvidia shares have tumbled roughly 13 per cent this month, Apple (NASDAQ: ) shed 9 per cent and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) lost 4 per cent, CNN reported.

Yields have surged in recent weeks as investors assess the state of the economy and the Fed’s higher-for-longer signal. While yields receded somewhat on Thursday, they remain near a decade high. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note was at 4.597 per cent, down from 4.626 per cent the day before, which marked the highest close since October 2007.

High yields often mean bad news for stocks, since investors tend to gravitate toward virtually risk-free Treasury bonds when they offer high returns over stocks, CNN reported.

Oil prices have rallied this summer, as several output cuts announced by OPEC+ have started to take hold on markets. US crude prices on Wednesday climbed to their highest level since last year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked fears about a supply constraint and sent oil prices skyrocketing. While prices dipped on Thursday, they remain elevated and within striking distance of $100 a barrel, CNN reported.

2022-09-30, IANS,Apple's 3nm chip demand to drop in 2024: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-3nm-chip-demand-to-drop-in-2024-report-3831010,"San Francisco, Sep 30 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: )'s 3nm chipsets, which are just beginning to hit the market, with the Apple A17 Pro being the first, are expected to see a decline in demand in 2024. According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, demand for this emerging technology may be weak next year, prompting major players to take a step back.

Apple is expected to reduce orders for 3nm chips next year, forcing the Netherlands-based semiconductor company ASML to reduce EUV equipment shipment by 20 to 30 per cent.

""The sharp decline is attributed to the end of work-from-home (WFH) demand and diminishing user appeal for the new specifications (Apple Silicon and Mini-LED). Looking ahead to 2024, Apple’s 3nm demand is negatively impacted by the lack of growth drivers for MacBook and iPad,"" Kuo wrote in a blog on Medium.

In 2022, Apple's MacBook and iPad shipments declined significantly by approximately 30 per cent and 22 per cent to 17 million and 48 million units, respectively.

Moreover, the report suggested that chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s 3nm demand for 2024 is also expected to be lower due to Huawei's decision to stop sourcing chips from Qualcomm, as well as the higher-than-anticipated penetration rate of Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) smartphones.

Huawei has recently made significant advances in chip development by outfitting its flagship Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro with its own 7nm Kirin 9000S 5G processor. Previously, the Chinese company relied on Qualcomm's 4G flagship processors.

In addition, Samsung, which used Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chips in all Galaxy S23 models this year, plans to significantly reduce its orders.

The report further mentioned that Samsung, Micron (NASDAQ: ), and SK Hynix aren't expected to launch memory expansion plans until 2025-2027.

2022-09-30, IANS,Can Google rule super-competitive smartphone market with Pixel?,https://in.investing.com/news/can-google-rule-supercompetitive-smartphone-market-with-pixel-3830890,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which has been a market leader in online search and other product categories for decades, is yet to cement its place in the global smartphone industry despite the popularity of the Google Pixel brand.According to Statista Consumer Insights released in May, Google remains a niche player in the smartphone market, with less than five per cent of smartphone users calling a Google device their main phone in most major markets.

However, a recent report by Counterpoint Research showed that the Google smartphone market grew in Japan, making the brand number two in the country.

Google achieved 9 per cent of the market share in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, surpassing local brands to secure the second position after Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has historically dominated the market with over 50 per cent share.

The recently launched Pixel 7a showed a 74 per cent increase in sales when compared to its predecessor.

According to industry experts, when it comes to India, the smartphone market offers significant headroom for growth in the country.

To succeed in this hypercompetitive market and win over demanding consumers requires an intricate dance between cutting-edge innovation and a deep understanding of the heartbeat of the market.

""Google’s upcoming Pixel phones are poised to build on the exceptional camera capabilities and seamless software experience of previous generation Pixel phones. If competitively priced and supported by aggressive go-to-market initiatives, the new Pixel phones have the potential to make significant strides in India,"" Prabhu Ram, Head of Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

""With good after-sales support, they can carve a niche amid the demands of India's discerning consumers. The strong premiumisation wave provides good tailwinds,"" he added.

Google debuted the ‘Made by Google’ Pixel smartphones in 2016 globally, including India. In the coming years, it launched Pixel 2 series, and Pixel 3 series in the country.

In 2019, Google decided not to release the Pixel 4 and instead released the Pixel 3A in May of that year.

In 2021, Google launched the Pixel 6 series and last year launched the Pixel 7 series.

Now, Google is set to launch Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices globally on October 4. The Pixel 8 is expected to feature a 6.2-inch display, Tensor G3 processor, and 50MP+12MP rear camera set-up, while the Pixel 8 Pro may come with a large 6.7-inch display, Tensor G3 processor and feature a triple camera set-up with a 64MP and a 48MP ultra-wide-angle camera.

In Q4 2022, Google overtook Samsung (KS: ) to become the number two brand in the global smartwatch market, showing significant growth while competing with market leaders. Apple continued to lead and dominate the market globally, according to Canalys report.

A flood watch is in effect through 6 a.m. Saturday for the entire tri-state - New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with rainfall rates of one to two inches per hour expected at times.

Strong storms have shut down swaths of the Big Apple (NASDAQ: )'s subway system, flooded some streets and highways, and cut off access to at least one terminal at the LaGuardia Airport.

A number of subway lines were suspended Friday morning with other lines suspending service through flooded stations, especially in Brooklyn.

""There is only extremely limited subway service available because of heavy flooding. Service is suspended at many stations,"" the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s subway account posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Hochul's announcement on Friday was followed by a similar order from New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who asked residents to shelter in place during the worst of the storm.

""I want to say to all New Yorkers, this is time for heightened alertness and extreme caution. If you are home, stay home. If you are at work or school, shelter in place for now,"" Adams said.

Parts of New York City saw five inches of rain as of 11 a.m. Friday. In Central Park, it was the most rainfall seen since the remnants of Ida swept through two years ago.

Video footage showed cars stuck in the flooded streets at the Red Hook neighbourhood in the Brooklyn borough. Some people were working to clear a drain in flood water.

A game set for Friday night between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets was postponed due to severe weather.

Officials conveyed to Apple the necessity of enforcing rules that prohibit unregistered foreign apps. Apple employees expressed apprehension about the potential impact of these rules on its user base.

China's intent to restrict these apps is aimed at closing a loophole in its Great Firewall that enables Chinese iPhone users to download popular Western social media apps like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

Although China has blocked web access to these platforms for years, users can access them through their apps when using a virtual private network (VPN) to connect to servers outside the country, despite China's ban on unauthorized VPNs.

These five social media apps have collectively been downloaded more than 170 million times in China through Apple's app store in the past decade, according to estimates by Sensor Tower.

Under new rules issued by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in July, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China app store after next July unless the app operators are registered with the government."
2022-09-29, Investing.com,iPhone 15 charging issues linked to USB-C power banks,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-15-charging-issues-linked-to-usbc-power-banks-93CH-3829225,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15 models, released this year with a USB-C port enabling compatibility with USB-C cables and power banks, are reportedly experiencing charging issues with certain USB-C battery packs. The problem was first highlighted on Friday on Reddit and the MacRumors forums.

The charging issue seems to stem from the iPhone's reverse charging feature, which allows the device to charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or another iPhone through its USB-C port. This feature is possibly causing some existing USB-C power banks to be incompatible with the iPhone 15 models. In some instances, the iPhone fails to charge or ends up charging the power bank instead.

The issue impacts a range of power banks, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list of non-functional models due to the vast number of them in the market. It has been confirmed that one version that does not work is the Anker PowerCore Slim 10K PD.

A customer who contacted Anker was informed that the only way to get the power bank to charge the iPhone is to use the USB-A port. Anker's statement suggested that the reverse charging function of the iPhone 15 series influences the USB C's port charging of their PowerCore Slim 10K PD model. The company has pledged to conduct further tests on all their power banks to determine if this is an issue with specific models and seek a solution.

Despite these concerns, most USB-C power banks with Power Delivery seem to be functioning as expected. Several models tested by MacRumors confirmed this. iPhone 15 owners should be aware of potential incompatibility issues with some power banks.

While this issue is being addressed, it's important to note that Apple, with a market capitalization of $2670.0 billion as provided by InvestingPro data, continues to be a significant player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. The company's performance has been impressive, yielding high returns on invested capital and a high return on assets of 28.23%, as per InvestingPro Tips. This strong performance has allowed Apple to maintain dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, with a growth rate of 4.35% as per InvestingPro's real-time metrics.

Despite a slight decline in revenue growth of -0.93%, Apple's revenue for the last twelve months (LTM2022.Q3) stood at a staggering $383.93 billion. The company also operates with a moderate level of debt, ensuring that cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments.

Big Tech rebounds as Treasury yields pause rally ahead of inflation data

Big tech including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) helped the broader market rebound from its recent malaise as U.S. eased from recent highs.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, ended the day marginally higher, as sentiment on the stock continues to be challenged by reports that users of its newly launched iPhone 15 are experiencing multiple issues including overheating.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a at a town hall meeting with educators at 4pm ET. The chief will be fielding questions from the audience, with investors eager to see whether he may walk back his hawkish comments from a week ago.

Powell's remarks will arrive just a day ahead of key inflation data, expected to show that core inflation remained steady last month, and continued to slow in the 12 months through August.

AMD pushes chips higher to shrug off Micron slump

Chip stocks also supported the broader move higher in tech following a rally in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) that offset a slump in Micron.

This development comes shortly after the launch of the iPhone 15 series, which marked a significant transition for the company as it adopted a universal Type-C interface, replacing its proprietary Lightning cables.

The shift to a universal Type-C interface was intended to benefit both existing iPhone users and those switching from Android devices. Reports of overheating when using Android chargers have emerged, however. Multiple media outlets have reported instances of iPhone 15 models becoming uncomfortably hot to touch during charging.

Apple Stores in China have responded by cautioning customers against using Android USB-C chargers with their new iPhones. This warning was first reported by Gizmo China at an Apple Store in Foshan, Guangdong Province, where staff cited concerns about the different pin arrangements between the two interfaces potentially leading to overheating. Similar advisories have been issued by multiple Apple-exclusive stores across China, as reported by Chinese portal CNMO.

Despite online rumors suggesting that using Android USB-C cables could potentially damage the new iPhones, AppleInsider reported on Thursday that this is not the case. The concern appears to primarily revolve around overheating issues that some users have experienced while charging their devices with these cables.

While Apple has not officially commented on this issue, these advisories have sparked discussions about whether they genuinely reflect device safety concerns or are part of a strategy to encourage iPhone 15 users to purchase Apple's own USB-C cables.

Apple's official guide does recommend using the company's own cables and charging adapters but also notes that third-party cables and power adapters can be used if they comply with specific criteria. These include compliance with USB 2.0 or later standards and adherence to relevant safety regulations. Apple has also warned that not all third-party adapters meet these safety standards and using such adapters could pose serious risks.

Amid these discussions, AppleInsider has clarified that using Android USB-C cables for the iPhone 15 series does not pose any risk of damage to the devices. The report explains that every USB-C cable typically comes with 24 pins, with 12 of those pins located on the side of the internal tongue to make it bi-directional, suitable for data and power transfer, charging, and alternate modes between a host and a client.

The report further suggests that rather than worrying about the adaptability of Android USB-C cables, iPhone 15 owners should be more concerned about the durability of their devices. A recent drop test revealed that despite using a titanium frame, the iPhone 15 Pro is less resistant than the iPhone 14 Pro.

Despite these concerns, it's worth noting that Apple has been performing strongly in the market. According to InvestingPro data, the company has a market capitalization of 2680.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 28.72. Its revenue stands at 383.93B USD, and it has maintained a positive growth trajectory. This financial stability has allowed Apple to maintain its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, as noted in InvestingPro Tips.

Moreover, as per InvestingPro Tips, Apple operates with a high return on assets and has been aggressively buying back shares, indicating the management's confidence in the company's future. This trend, combined with the fact that the company is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, suggests that Apple's position in the market remains strong despite the current discussions surrounding the iPhone 15 series.

2022-10-01, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3831542,"Investing.com -- With an eleventh-hour deal reached to avert a U.S. government shutdown investors will be focusing on U.S. jobs data and speeches by Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in the week ahead. Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Meta AI wows analysts, Micron forecasts a big loss, Amazon is sued by the FTC, Apple dealing with scorching iPhone temps.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Analysts cheered by Meta's freshest AI innovations

Wall Street analysts are positive on Meta (NASDAQ: ) after the company unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) features and showcased its latest range of head-worn devices at its annual “Connect” developers conference this past week.

The new products include AI-enabled Ray-Ban smart glasses that can livestream what a user is seeing directly to Facebook and Instagram, as well as a newly updated virtual-reality headset. The company also presented a new AI chatbot and a studio for developers to create brand-specific chatbots.

Analysts are particularly optimistic about the AI potential.

Oppenheimer wrote that the updates show that the company ""understands investors want more focus on AI vs. the Metaverse,"" reiterating its Outperform rating on the company, and Evercore analysts said of the smart glasses: ""All in, this is a solid update, and we believe an important step towards mass adoption of AR/VR technology.""

UBS said it was ""positively surprised by the level of innovation going on at Meta, the series of products likely to boost engagement, and a clear path to medium-term monetization potential of genAI products.""

And Bank of America (NYSE: ) said the event ""offered early signs on how Meta will use AI to help drive user engagement (chat and image creation) and new business services,"" adding, ""We expect a number of AI based advertiser tools to help with ad creation and campaign management as well.”

Meta shares gained 1.6% for the week to $300.21.

Amazon accused of wielding 'monopoly power' by FTC in new antitrust lawsuit; invests in ChatGPT rival

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) took a fall Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant, but some analysts have maintained their positive outlook on the company.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of the lawsuit.

CFRA likewise maintained its Buy rating on Amazon and said it believes the lawsuit ""will be a lengthy and uphill battle for the FTC."" Along with Wedbush, it believes major structural changes in the company are unlikely. Wedbush added, ""Consistent with our view ahead of the lawsuit’s filing, we would be buyers of the pullback in shares.""

Amazon ultimately recovered some of its Tuesday losses and ended down 1.8% for the week to $127.12.

Separately, Amazon also announced in the past week that it is aiming to invest up to $4B in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, rival to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, aiming to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon says an initial investment of $1.25B could expand to $4B depending on certain conditions. Anthropic will then have access to Amazon's cloud computing platform to help optimize its AI systems, known as large language models.





Micron loses ground on shaky outlook

Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported Wednesday better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter , but a mixed picture on the outlook for the first quarter amid a challenging backdrop as the chip supply glut continued to keep a lid on demand.

Micron reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 a share, $0.08 better than anticipated, on above-par revenue of $4.01 billion.

For the fiscal first quarter, however, the company guided for a loss in a range of $1 to $1.14 a share versus consensus for $0.92 in the red, and revenue of $4.2B to $4.6B that comes in well below the $4.22B consensus.

JPMorgan raised the price target by $5 to $80 per share on MU, maintaining its Overweight rating, citing the beginning of an ""upturn"" in the memory industry and saying it believes Micron shares will rise through the rest of the year and into next ""as the market continues to discount improving revenue/pricing/margin/earnings power.""

Goldman Sachs commented in a similar manner:

""Despite what now appears to be a slower than previously expected recovery in gross margins and EPS, our constructive thesis on the stock predicated on improving demand and supply discipline (i.e. reduction in Wafer Fab Equipment spending and wafer starts) remains unchanged and, as such, we would view any pullback in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.""

Shares lost 4.4% on Thursday after the report, but clawed back those losses on Friday and ended down just fractionally for the week to $68.03.

Apple iPhones overheating: report

The new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The concerns, which echo similar ones for iPhone14 Pro, have been raised in consumer social media posts as well as reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ - the latter of which showed the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging, and up to 112 degrees (44C), when charging coincides with processor-intensive activities such as gaming.

Apple may need to address these overheating issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

2022-10-01, IANS,"Apple blames iOS 17 bug, apps like Instagram for making new iPhones run warmer",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-blames-ios-17-bug-apps-like-instagram-for-making-new-iphones-run-warmer-3831391,"New Delhi, Oct 1 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) on Sunday said it has identified a few conditions which can cause new iPhones to run warmer than expected, including a bug in the iOS 17 software update and some third-party apps like Instagram.The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity, the company said in a statement.

“We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update,” the iPhone maker said.

The new titanium material on iPhone 15 Pro, paired with its aluminum substructure and new system design, result in better heat dissipation than any prior stainless steel Pro models.

iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max do not suffer from overheating due to their design, contrary to some reports. Apple said that another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system.

“We’re working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out,” said the company.

Third-party apps that Apple is currently aware of that overload the CPU and cause the iPhone to run warmer than normal include Asphalt 9, Instagram and Uber.

The tech giant will continue to investigate to see if there are others and work with those developers to implement fixes.

Instagram already issued a fix on September 27 (v302) to address its issue.

However, the bug fix coming in iOS 17 does not involve reducing performance to address iPhone temperature.

The new iPhones feel warmer when users set up their devices for the first time, restore from a backup, wirelessly charge their device, use graphics-intensive or processor-intensive apps, games, or features, including augmented-reality apps; and/or stream high-quality video.

These conditions are normal, and the device will return to a regular temperature when the process is complete or when a user finishes their activity.

If a user's device doesn't display a temperature warning, they can keep using their device.

Those who use a larger USB-C power adapter (20W +) should expect iPhone temperature to temporarily increase while fast charging, according to the company.

The iPhone still regulates power into the device at up to 27W so long as the adapter is compliant with the USB-C PD (Power Delivery) standard.

This temporary increase in temperature will not impact the long term performance of the iPhone and is not a safety or injury risk.

2022-09-30, IANS,Warning signs suggest this year’s Wall Street rally is on shaky legs,https://in.investing.com/news/warning-signs-suggest-this-years-wall-street-rally-is-on-shaky-legs-3831091,"New York, Sep 30 (IANS) Stocks rebounded this year after a bruising 2022, as artificial intelligence excitement led investors to fuel a powerful tech-driven surge. Seemingly abating inflation also raised hopes on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve would soon curb its interest rate hiking cycle, helping equities edge higher, media reports said.Now, markets aren’t looking so picturesque. The economy’s resilience against numerous interest rate hikes, a tick up in inflation data this month, and the Fed’s indication that it could raise rates once more this year and keep them higher for longer than expected has started to chip away at the market’s gains, CNN reported.

While the benchmark is not in correction territory, defined in this case as a 10 per cent fall from its most recent peak on July 31, that means stocks have more room to fall, says Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi (NASDAQ: ).

""There’s more risk to the downside, at least in the near term,"" said Young, CNN reported.

While shares of tech behemoths have led the market’s surge this year, the rally had begun to broaden out in early summer.

But it's since narrowed over the past few months. The percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 index trading above their 200-day moving averages, a commonly watched indicator of market breadth, fell this week to its lowest level since March.

A narrow rally doesn’t bode well for the market’s health, since having just a small share of stocks holding it up means that it’s more susceptible to a downturn. This year, shares of tech giants have been responsible for the lion’s share of the market’s run — but even those have taken a hit in recent weeks. Nvidia shares have tumbled roughly 13 per cent this month, Apple (NASDAQ: ) shed 9 per cent and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) lost 4 per cent, CNN reported.

Yields have surged in recent weeks as investors assess the state of the economy and the Fed’s higher-for-longer signal. While yields receded somewhat on Thursday, they remain near a decade high. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note was at 4.597 per cent, down from 4.626 per cent the day before, which marked the highest close since October 2007.

High yields often mean bad news for stocks, since investors tend to gravitate toward virtually risk-free Treasury bonds when they offer high returns over stocks, CNN reported.

Oil prices have rallied this summer, as several output cuts announced by OPEC+ have started to take hold on markets. US crude prices on Wednesday climbed to their highest level since last year, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked fears about a supply constraint and sent oil prices skyrocketing. While prices dipped on Thursday, they remain elevated and within striking distance of $100 a barrel, CNN reported.

2022-09-30, IANS,Apple's 3nm chip demand to drop in 2024: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-3nm-chip-demand-to-drop-in-2024-report-3831010,"San Francisco, Sep 30 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: )'s 3nm chipsets, which are just beginning to hit the market, with the Apple A17 Pro being the first, are expected to see a decline in demand in 2024. According to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, demand for this emerging technology may be weak next year, prompting major players to take a step back.

Apple is expected to reduce orders for 3nm chips next year, forcing the Netherlands-based semiconductor company ASML to reduce EUV equipment shipment by 20 to 30 per cent.

""The sharp decline is attributed to the end of work-from-home (WFH) demand and diminishing user appeal for the new specifications (Apple Silicon and Mini-LED). Looking ahead to 2024, Apple’s 3nm demand is negatively impacted by the lack of growth drivers for MacBook and iPad,"" Kuo wrote in a blog on Medium.

In 2022, Apple's MacBook and iPad shipments declined significantly by approximately 30 per cent and 22 per cent to 17 million and 48 million units, respectively.

Moreover, the report suggested that chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: )'s 3nm demand for 2024 is also expected to be lower due to Huawei's decision to stop sourcing chips from Qualcomm, as well as the higher-than-anticipated penetration rate of Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) smartphones.

Huawei has recently made significant advances in chip development by outfitting its flagship Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro with its own 7nm Kirin 9000S 5G processor. Previously, the Chinese company relied on Qualcomm's 4G flagship processors.

In addition, Samsung, which used Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chips in all Galaxy S23 models this year, plans to significantly reduce its orders.

The report further mentioned that Samsung, Micron (NASDAQ: ), and SK Hynix aren't expected to launch memory expansion plans until 2025-2027.

2022-09-30, IANS,Can Google rule super-competitive smartphone market with Pixel?,https://in.investing.com/news/can-google-rule-supercompetitive-smartphone-market-with-pixel-3830890,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which has been a market leader in online search and other product categories for decades, is yet to cement its place in the global smartphone industry despite the popularity of the Google Pixel brand.According to Statista Consumer Insights released in May, Google remains a niche player in the smartphone market, with less than five per cent of smartphone users calling a Google device their main phone in most major markets.

However, a recent report by Counterpoint Research showed that the Google smartphone market grew in Japan, making the brand number two in the country.

Google achieved 9 per cent of the market share in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, surpassing local brands to secure the second position after Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has historically dominated the market with over 50 per cent share.

The recently launched Pixel 7a showed a 74 per cent increase in sales when compared to its predecessor.

According to industry experts, when it comes to India, the smartphone market offers significant headroom for growth in the country.

To succeed in this hypercompetitive market and win over demanding consumers requires an intricate dance between cutting-edge innovation and a deep understanding of the heartbeat of the market.

""Google’s upcoming Pixel phones are poised to build on the exceptional camera capabilities and seamless software experience of previous generation Pixel phones. If competitively priced and supported by aggressive go-to-market initiatives, the new Pixel phones have the potential to make significant strides in India,"" Prabhu Ram, Head of Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

""With good after-sales support, they can carve a niche amid the demands of India's discerning consumers. The strong premiumisation wave provides good tailwinds,"" he added.

Google debuted the ‘Made by Google’ Pixel smartphones in 2016 globally, including India. In the coming years, it launched Pixel 2 series, and Pixel 3 series in the country.

In 2019, Google decided not to release the Pixel 4 and instead released the Pixel 3A in May of that year.

In 2021, Google launched the Pixel 6 series and last year launched the Pixel 7 series.

Now, Google is set to launch Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices globally on October 4. The Pixel 8 is expected to feature a 6.2-inch display, Tensor G3 processor, and 50MP+12MP rear camera set-up, while the Pixel 8 Pro may come with a large 6.7-inch display, Tensor G3 processor and feature a triple camera set-up with a 64MP and a 48MP ultra-wide-angle camera.

In Q4 2022, Google overtook Samsung (KS: ) to become the number two brand in the global smartwatch market, showing significant growth while competing with market leaders. Apple continued to lead and dominate the market globally, according to Canalys report.

A flood watch is in effect through 6 a.m. Saturday for the entire tri-state - New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, with rainfall rates of one to two inches per hour expected at times.

Strong storms have shut down swaths of the Big Apple (NASDAQ: )'s subway system, flooded some streets and highways, and cut off access to at least one terminal at the LaGuardia Airport.

A number of subway lines were suspended Friday morning with other lines suspending service through flooded stations, especially in Brooklyn.

""There is only extremely limited subway service available because of heavy flooding. Service is suspended at many stations,"" the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)'s subway account posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Hochul's announcement on Friday was followed by a similar order from New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who asked residents to shelter in place during the worst of the storm.

""I want to say to all New Yorkers, this is time for heightened alertness and extreme caution. If you are home, stay home. If you are at work or school, shelter in place for now,"" Adams said.

Parts of New York City saw five inches of rain as of 11 a.m. Friday. In Central Park, it was the most rainfall seen since the remnants of Ida swept through two years ago.

Video footage showed cars stuck in the flooded streets at the Red Hook neighbourhood in the Brooklyn borough. Some people were working to clear a drain in flood water.

A game set for Friday night between the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets was postponed due to severe weather.

2022-09-29, Investing.com,Apple met with China government to discuss new restrictive regulations - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-met-with-china-government-to-discuss-new-restrictive-regulations--wsj-432SI-3829635,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) executives held meetings with Chinese officials in recent months to address concerns related to new regulations that will restrict the company from offering numerous foreign apps currently available on its iPhone app store in China, the Wall Street Journal reported today.

Officials conveyed to Apple the necessity of enforcing rules that prohibit unregistered foreign apps. Apple employees expressed apprehension about the potential impact of these rules on its user base.

China's intent to restrict these apps is aimed at closing a loophole in its Great Firewall that enables Chinese iPhone users to download popular Western social media apps like Instagram, X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp.

Although China has blocked web access to these platforms for years, users can access them through their apps when using a virtual private network (VPN) to connect to servers outside the country, despite China's ban on unauthorized VPNs.

These five social media apps have collectively been downloaded more than 170 million times in China through Apple's app store in the past decade, according to estimates by Sensor Tower.

Under new rules issued by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in July, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China app store after next July unless the app operators are registered with the government."
2022-09-29, Investing.com,iPhone 15 charging issues linked to USB-C power banks,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-15-charging-issues-linked-to-usbc-power-banks-93CH-3829225,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15 models, released this year with a USB-C port enabling compatibility with USB-C cables and power banks, are reportedly experiencing charging issues with certain USB-C battery packs. The problem was first highlighted on Friday on Reddit and the MacRumors forums.

The charging issue seems to stem from the iPhone's reverse charging feature, which allows the device to charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or another iPhone through its USB-C port. This feature is possibly causing some existing USB-C power banks to be incompatible with the iPhone 15 models. In some instances, the iPhone fails to charge or ends up charging the power bank instead.

The issue impacts a range of power banks, making it challenging to compile a comprehensive list of non-functional models due to the vast number of them in the market. It has been confirmed that one version that does not work is the Anker PowerCore Slim 10K PD.

A customer who contacted Anker was informed that the only way to get the power bank to charge the iPhone is to use the USB-A port. Anker's statement suggested that the reverse charging function of the iPhone 15 series influences the USB C's port charging of their PowerCore Slim 10K PD model. The company has pledged to conduct further tests on all their power banks to determine if this is an issue with specific models and seek a solution.

Despite these concerns, most USB-C power banks with Power Delivery seem to be functioning as expected. Several models tested by MacRumors confirmed this. iPhone 15 owners should be aware of potential incompatibility issues with some power banks.

While this issue is being addressed, it's important to note that Apple, with a market capitalization of $2670.0 billion as provided by InvestingPro data, continues to be a significant player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. The company's performance has been impressive, yielding high returns on invested capital and a high return on assets of 28.23%, as per InvestingPro Tips.

Big Tech rebounds as Treasury yields pause rally ahead of inflation data

Big tech including Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) helped the broader market rebound from its recent malaise as U.S. eased from recent highs.

Apple (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, ended the day marginally higher, as sentiment on the stock continues to be challenged by reports that users of its newly launched iPhone 15 are experiencing multiple issues including overheating.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a at a town hall meeting with educators at 4pm ET. The chief will be fielding questions from the audience, with investors eager to see whether he may walk back his hawkish comments from a week ago.

Powell's remarks will arrive just a day ahead of key inflation data, expected to show that core inflation remained steady last month, and continued to slow in the 12 months through August.

AMD pushes chips higher to shrug off Micron slump

Chip stocks also supported the broader move higher in tech following a rally in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) that offset a slump in Micron.

Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 4% after its forecast for bigger losses for its fiscal first quarter overshadowed better-than-expected .

Analysts, however, continued to back the memory chipmaker amid signs that the supply glut overhang is easing.

CarMax feels pain from waning used car demand; Peloton, Lululemon team up

CarMax Inc (NYSE: ) fell more than 13% after the used-car retailer reported second-quarter that fell short of Wall Street estimates as pressure on consumers hurt demand for used cars.

The company flagged ongoing “vehicle affordability challenges” as a headwind amid “widespread inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, tightened lending standards.”

Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, struck a partnership with Lululemon (NASDAQ: ) to supply its fitness-related content to athletic apparel company. Under the partnership, Lululemon will become Peloton’s primary athletic apparel partner.

The deal furthers Peloton’s goal to simplify its business, UBS says, by outsourcing the apparel business.

2022-09-28, Investing.com,Apple advises against using Android USB-C cables for iPhone 15 in China,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-advises-against-using-android-usbc-cables-for-iphone-15-in-china-93CH-3828575,"In a move that has sparked debates among consumers and tech enthusiasts, Apple (NASDAQ: ) Stores across China have been advising iPhone 15 users against using Android USB-C cables to charge their devices due to concerns about overheating. This development comes shortly after the launch of the iPhone 15 series, which marked a significant transition for the company as it adopted a universal Type-C interface, replacing its proprietary Lightning cables.

The shift to a universal Type-C interface was intended to benefit both existing iPhone users and those switching from Android devices. Reports of overheating when using Android chargers have emerged, however. Multiple media outlets have reported instances of iPhone 15 models becoming uncomfortably hot to touch during charging.

Apple Stores in China have responded by cautioning customers against using Android USB-C chargers with their new iPhones. This warning was first reported by Gizmo China at an Apple Store in Foshan, Guangdong Province, where staff cited concerns about the different pin arrangements between the two interfaces potentially leading to overheating. Similar advisories have been issued by multiple Apple-exclusive stores across China, as reported by Chinese portal CNMO.

Despite online rumors suggesting that using Android USB-C cables could potentially damage the new iPhones, AppleInsider reported on Thursday that this is not the case. The concern appears to primarily revolve around overheating issues that some users have experienced while charging their devices with these cables.

While Apple has not officially commented on this issue, these advisories have sparked discussions about whether they genuinely reflect device safety concerns or are part of a strategy to encourage iPhone 15 users to purchase Apple's own USB-C cables.

Apple's official guide does recommend using the company's own cables and charging adapters but also notes that third-party cables and power adapters can be used if they comply with specific criteria. These include compliance with USB 2.0 or later standards and adherence to relevant safety regulations. Apple has also warned that not all third-party adapters meet these safety standards and using such adapters could pose serious risks.

Amid these discussions, AppleInsider has clarified that using Android USB-C cables for the iPhone 15 series does not pose any risk of damage to the devices. The report explains that every USB-C cable typically comes with 24 pins, with 12 of those pins located on the side of the internal tongue to make it bi-directional, suitable for data and power transfer, charging, and alternate modes between a host and a client.

The report further suggests that rather than worrying about the adaptability of Android USB-C cables, iPhone 15 owners should be more concerned about the durability of their devices. A recent drop test revealed that despite using a titanium frame, the iPhone 15 Pro is less resistant than the iPhone 14 Pro.

Despite these concerns, it's worth noting that Apple has been performing strongly in the market. According to InvestingPro data, the company has a market capitalization of 2680.0B USD and a P/E ratio of 28.72. Its revenue stands at 383.93B USD, and it has maintained a positive growth trajectory. This financial stability has allowed Apple to maintain its dividend payments for 12 consecutive years, as noted in InvestingPro Tips.

Moreover, as per InvestingPro Tips, Apple operates with a high return on assets and has been aggressively buying back shares, indicating the management's confidence in the company's future. This trend, combined with the fact that the company is a prominent player in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, suggests that Apple's position in the market remains strong despite the current discussions surrounding the iPhone 15 series.

For those interested in more insights, InvestingPro offers numerous additional tips for AAPL and other companies.

Altman and Ive have held brainstorming sessions, the people told the paper, but the process of developing the product is still in its early stages. The collaboration intends to create a more intuitive way for users to interact with AI, the FT added.

SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has also reportedly been involved in some of the talks, the FT said. He has floated both providing financial backing to the project and bringing in Arm, the chip designer that is more than 90% owned by the Japanese tech investment management group. SoftBank is reportedly considering an investment of over $1 billion in the venture.

OpenAI, LoveFrom, and SoftBank all declined to comment, the FT noted. Aspects of the discussions were first reported in The Information."

2022-09-28, Investing.com,Apple stock dips amid reports that iPhone 15 owners complain about overheating,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-stock-dips-amid-reports-that-iphone-15-owners-complain-about-overheating-432SI-3828063,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares are trading modestly lower in premarket Thursday following the Wall Street Journal report that the new iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues.

These concerns have been raised in reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ and through social media posts from customers. This is not a novelty as iPhone 14 Pro owners also complained about hotter-than-usual temperatures.

The tests showed that overheating occurs during activities like charging and running resource-intensive applications. Apple may need to address these issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

In a review by the WSJ’s Joanna Stern, it was observed that the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging. Subsequent testing revealed that the phone's temperature could climb even higher, up to 112 degrees (44C), when engaged in simultaneous charging and processor-intensive activities, such as gaming.

Apple analysts at TF International Securities, known for closely monitoring the company's supply chain, have attributed the heat-related problems in the iPhone 15 Pro models to several factors.

One key factor is the new lightweight design of the iPhone 15 Pro, which may not efficiently dissipate heat compared to previous models. Additionally, the introduction of a titanium frame in only the Pro models is seen as a potential issue."
2022-09-28, Investing.com,Apple's upcoming iPhone SE 4 may outperform iPhone 14 with promising features,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-upcoming-iphone-se-4-may-outperform-iphone-14-with-promising-features-93CH-3827829,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly testing significant upgrades for the fourth generation of its iPhone SE model, potentially making it a more attractive option than the Apple iPhone 14. Reports suggest that the new model, internally referred to as 'Ghost', will feature advanced specifications including a 48-megapixel rear camera, USB-C port, and an action button, according to information leaked on Thursday.

The iPhone SE line has traditionally been considered less feature-rich and more affordable compared to other models. However, the latest leaks indicate a shift in this trend, with the upcoming iPhone SE 4 expected to bring in a new design inspired by the base model iPhone 14.

The iPhone SE 4 will maintain iPhone 14 test parameters for internal testing and will include an action button, a feature introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro models. It will also be equipped with a USB-C port, replacing the traditional lightning port used in previous models. The smartphone's single camera with flash is expected to align in an arrangement similar to the third-generation iPhone SE.

This would mark the first time an SE model will include Face ID feature. The display of the Apple iPhone SE 4 is also expected to be on par with the Apple iPhone 14. ""Preliminary information suggests that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 may feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, providing for a significant upgrade from the current model"", according to MacRumors.

While these upgrades seem ambitious for a budget model like the iPhone SE, it is suggested that these features will become cost-effective by the time of launch. The exact release date remains unclear, but reports indicate it could be in either 2024 or 2025.

The rumors around these features have not yet been confirmed by Apple and it remains uncertain which features will be available at launch. As such, consumers and tech enthusiasts are advised to stay tuned for further updates.

2022-09-28, IANS,World Heart Day: How heart health tools on Apple Watch can save many lives,https://in.investing.com/news/world-heart-day-how-heart-health-tools-on-apple-watch-can-save-many-lives-3827805,"New Delhi, Sep 28 (IANS) Ahead of World Heart Day on September 29, the World Heart Federation is encouraging people around the world to take care of their heart and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch, which has alerted several users around the world of potential signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), is one digital device that can be your health companion.Apple Watch Series 9, and previous models too, check for unusually high or low heart rates in the background, which could be signs of a serious underlying condition. This could help users identify situations that may warrant further evaluation.

If a user's heart rate is above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm while they appear to have been inactive for 10 minutes, they will receive a notification.

Users can adjust the threshold bpm or turn these notifications on or off. All heart rate notifications — along with date, time, and heart rate — can be viewed in the Health app on iPhone.

The irregular rhythm notification feature on your Apple Watch will occasionally look at your heartbeat to check for an irregular rhythm that might be suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AFib).

AFib is a type of irregular heart rhythm where the upper chambers of the heart beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Some individuals with AFib don’t experience any symptoms.

Others experience symptoms that could include rapid heartbeat, palpitations, fatigue, or shortness of breath.

Irregular rhythm notifications use the optical heart sensor on Apple Watch to detect the pulse wave at the wrist and look for variability in beat‑to‑beat intervals when the user is at rest.

If the algorithm repeatedly detects an irregular rhythm suggestive of AFib, you will receive a notification and the date, time, and beat‑to‑beat heart rate will be recorded in the Health app.

With the ECG app, users who experience symptoms, such as rapid or skipped heartbeat, can capture an ECG and record their symptoms.

The ECG app uses the electrical heart sensor built into the Digital Crown and the back crystal to record a single-lead ECG. The ECG app then provides a result of sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with high heart rate, inconclusive, or poor recording, and prompts the user to enter any symptoms such as rapid or pounding heartbeat, dizziness, or fatigue.

The recorded waveform, results, date, time, and any symptoms are recorded and can be exported from the Health app as a PDF to share with a clinician.

The Cardio Fitness feature provides an estimate of VO2 Max, or your body's ability to intake oxygen during exercise.

Heart health experts recognize VO2 Max as a powerful predictor of overall health and Apple has brought this technology to all users as Apple Watch can give you a scientifically validated estimate of VO2 Max.

Users can even opt in to receive a notification if their classification drops to ""low,"" which is associated with risks of serious longterm health conditions. Fortunately, it is something you can improve by exercising more frequently or more rigorously, and something you can easily track along the way.

AFib History gives you an estimate of the amount to time your heart shows signs of AFib. This is important because research has shown the amount of time spent in AFib can relate to severity of symptoms, quality of life issues and risk of complications.

AFib History also allows users to track specific life factors like sleep, exercise and weight, which may influence the amount of time spent AFib.

Historically, there hasn't been an easy way to track AFib overtime or to compare them to important life factors. Now you can do this simply by wearing an Apple Watch.

2022-09-28, IANS,iPhone 15 Pro Max redefines luxury in a smartphone with top-notch features,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-15-pro-max-redefines-luxury-in-a-smartphone-with-topnotch-features-3827529,"New Delhi, Sep 28 (IANS) The iPhone Pro Max series has always been a dream for millions of Indians to own and flaunt it in their circles, and a high price point only justifies what comes with a super-premium smartphone that continues to stay at the very top. The new iPhone 15 Pro Max has just elevated premium smartphone experience with several industry-first features.With trade-in, no-cost EMIs and instant savings at Apple (NASDAQ: ) Store Online, its own branded retails stores or at authorised resellers, an iPhone 15 Pro Max can actually land in your hands, featuring a strong and lightweight titanium design with new contoured edges, a new Action button, powerful camera upgrades, and A17 Pro for next-level performance and mobile gaming.

Why does an iPhone Pro Max always attracts the most eyeballs? Let’s find out why.

This time, the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max has been designed with aerospace-grade titanium — a first for an iPhone.

This premium alloy -- the same used in spacecraft -- has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever.

The device features a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone.

Moreover, the toughest back glass in a smartphone has the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front.

The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.

Now the all-new Action button that has replaced the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent.

You can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activating Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or using Shortcuts for more options.

You can even unlock the car or switch on the heated seats with the Action Button.

By default, the new Action button can switch between ring and silent, but you can choose from a set of actions for even more convenience and versatility.

The A17 Pro silicon is the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip, heralding improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history.

The new CPU is up to 10 per cent faster and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17.

For gamers, the pro-class GPU is up to 20 per cent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency.

With hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro Max offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences.

A17 Pro includes a dedicated AV1 decoder, enabling more efficient, high-quality video experiences for streaming services.

Additionally, a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR.

You can now get up to 20x faster transfer speeds with an optional USB 3 cable.

The preferred smartphone for creative pros and filmmakers has become better with new pro workflows.

Through a deep integration of hardware and software, the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro Max packs the equivalent of seven pro lenses — all enabled by A17 Pro.

With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing.

The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default.

The iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm.

Moreover, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module — Apple’s most advanced stabilisation system yet for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances.

Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colours, and better low-light performance.

For the first time, you can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode.

Night mode gets better with sharper details and more vivid colours, now powered by the Photonic Engine, including Night mode portraits, enabled by the LiDAR scanner.

New Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app.

This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online.

iPhone 15 Pro Max are now available in black titanium, white titanium, blue titanium, and natural titanium finishes, starting at Rs 159,900 in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacities.

Apple has also extended its support for ISRO-created navigation system called NavIC for iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which is a significant achievement for the country.

Conclusion: iPhone 15 Pro Max is undoubtedly the most pro smartphone ever created, representing the best of Apple design and industry-first innovations to help you work, play, create and innovate.

2022-09-28, Investing.com,Google Pixel chips away at iPhone's dominance in Japan,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pixel-chips-away-at-iphones-dominance-in-japan-93CH-3827483,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google Pixel has made significant strides in the Japanese market, eroding the dominance of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s iPhone, according to data released on Thursday. The Google-owned smartphone brand has achieved a record 12% market share in the June quarter, marking a sixfold improvement from the same period last year.

The surge in Google Pixel's popularity comes after years of underwhelming performance and misfires in the Japanese market. Counterpoint Research, which provided the data, did not detail what led to this sudden upswing. It is clear that Google Pixel's gain has come at the expense of iPhone's market share.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which has long been a dominant player in Japan, saw its market share drop almost equivalently from 58% to 46%. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's market cap stands at a staggering $2.66 trillion with a P/E ratio of 28.48, indicating a strong market performance despite the recent decline in Japan. This decline coincides with the increasing price tags of iPhone models, although it remains unclear whether there is a direct correlation between these two events.

InvestingPro Tips reveals that Apple has been aggressively buying back shares and yields a high return on invested capital. Additionally, the company's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be an attractive feature for investors.

This shift in market dynamics indicates a changing landscape in Japan's smartphone industry. Although Apple still retains a significant portion of the market, the rise of Google Pixel suggests that Japanese consumers are exploring other options.

Google, with a market cap of $1.65 trillion and a P/E ratio of 27.66 according to InvestingPro data, has seen a large price uptick over the last six months. The company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has been a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry.

InvestingPro Tips for Google highlights that the company yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets. However, it's worth noting that Google does not pay a dividend to shareholders, unlike Apple.

ChatGPT developer OpenAI, building large language models and art-generating AI, now wants to get into hardware, reports The Information.

For this, Ive who is the renowned designer of the iPhone is reportedly in talks with Altman about an AI hardware project.

“SoftBank CEO and investor Masayoshi Son has talked to both about the idea,” the report mentioned, citing people aware of the matter.

OpenAI’s hardware efforts are in the very earliest stages, as per the report.

Altman and Ive have only begun what kind of hardware could do or look like.

OpenAI once had a robotics research division but it was disbanded in July 2021 after encountering technical roadblocks.

In 2019, Ive announced he would leave Apple after 27 years to start his own design firm, LoveFrom, together with industrial designer Marc Newson.

In July 2022, Apple ended its consulting agreement with Ive.

Ive was also hired by the Agnelli family to work on Ferrari (NYSE: ) vehicles.

Meanwhile, OpenAI is reportedly raising funds at a valuation of $80-$90 billion via sale of existing shares.

In April, OpenAI OpenAI closed a more than $300 million share sale at a valuation of $29 billion.

Earlier this year, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) invested around $10 billion in the AI startup. The tech giant owns 49 per cent in OpenAI.

Last month, OpenAI said it is expected to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2022.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,Overheating issues plague iPhone 15 Pro due to internal design and titanium finish,https://in.investing.com/news/overheating-issues-plague-iphone-15-pro-due-to-internal-design-and-titanium-finish-93CH-3825858,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s latest flagship smartphones, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, have been reportedly experiencing overheating issues since their recent release. Initially, speculations pointed towards the new A17 Pro chip as the potential cause of the problem. However, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has clarified that changes made to the internal design of the models are responsible for the overheating.

Kuo explained that Apple compromised on the thermal system this year to maintain the weight of the device. The company might have used fewer heat dissipation techniques or materials to prevent an increase in the phone's weight. This alteration in the internal design is believed to be a significant factor behind the overheating issue.

Furthermore, Apple's decision to use titanium for the frame of these models has also contributed to the problem. Despite its durability and ability to withstand high drops, titanium has a detrimental impact on thermal efficiency. This material choice has led to an increase in device temperatures, with some users reporting temperatures as high as 46 degrees Celsius (116 degrees Fahrenheit).

In addition to these design factors, another potential cause for overheating has been identified. Apple stores in China have advised against using ""Android USB-C"" versions due to differences in pin arrangement between Android and Apple interfaces. The narrower spacing in the 9-pin and 11-pin connections may cause overheating when attached to the iPhone 15, potentially damaging the device's USB-C port.

Despite these issues, Kuo believes that software updates from Apple will likely only make a minor difference. These updates could restrict the processor's performance to prevent overheating but may not completely resolve the problem. The analyst further warns that these unresolved issues could negatively impact shipments of iPhone 15 Pro models.

Apple has not yet commented on these concerns. As of now, it remains unclear how customer warranties will be fulfilled if these overheating issues lead to device damage.

Treasury yields remain at multi-year highs as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon of 7% interest rates

Treasury yields remained at their highest level in more than decade, with the at close to 4.54%, after JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warned that the Federal Reserve could lift rates to 7%.

“I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%,” Dimon told The Times of India in an interview. “I ask people in business, ‘Are you prepared for something like 7%?’ The worst case is 7% with stagflation.

Tech resumes slide as higher rates bite

Big tech resumed its slide after brief respite on Monday as investors continue to price in the pain for growth stocks amid the prospect of higher for longer interest rate regime.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 2% to lead big tech lower, followed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) as higher rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

Amazon drops after FTC, 17 state AGs file lawsuit

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 3% after the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against the online retailer, alleging that it has used anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegal maintain a monopoly.

The FTC was joined in the lawsuit by 17 state attorney generals, alleging Amazon's actions stopped rivals and sellers from lower prices, stifled competition and degraded quality for shoppers.

Amazon’s general counsel and senior vice president of global public policy, David Zapolsky, refuted the allegations against the company, saying in a statement that ""the lawsuit filed by the FTC today is wrong on the facts and the law, and we look forward to making that case in court.”

Lawmakers in scramble to avert government shutdown

Lawmakers in Washington appear to be stepping up the pace to avert a government shutdown by the Oct. 1 deadline that would force the federal government to stop non-essential operations.

The Senate plans Tuesday to vote on a bill to extend government funding for 45 days, which if passed, would then proceed to the House for Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy to decide whether to bring it up for a vote.

But there isn’t a guarantee that it will pass the House as a group of conservative lawmakers are opposed to short-term funding extension."
2022-09-28, Investing.com,Apple stock dips amid reports that iPhone 15 owners complain about overheating,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-stock-dips-amid-reports-that-iphone-15-owners-complain-about-overheating-432SI-3828063,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares are trading modestly lower in premarket Thursday following the Wall Street Journal report that the new iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues.

These concerns have been raised in reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ and through social media posts from customers. This is not a novelty as iPhone 14 Pro owners also complained about hotter-than-usual temperatures.

The tests showed that overheating occurs during activities like charging and running resource-intensive applications. Apple may need to address these issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

In a review by the WSJ’s Joanna Stern, it was observed that the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging. Subsequent testing revealed that the phone's temperature could climb even higher, up to 112 degrees (44C), when engaged in simultaneous charging and processor-intensive activities, such as gaming.

Apple analysts at TF International Securities, known for closely monitoring the company's supply chain, have attributed the heat-related problems in the iPhone 15 Pro models to several factors.

One key factor is the new lightweight design of the iPhone 15 Pro, which may not efficiently dissipate heat compared to previous models. Additionally, the introduction of a titanium frame in only the Pro models is seen as a potential issue."
2022-09-28, Investing.com,Apple's upcoming iPhone SE 4 may outperform iPhone 14 with promising features,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-upcoming-iphone-se-4-may-outperform-iphone-14-with-promising-features-93CH-3827829,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly testing significant upgrades for the fourth generation of its iPhone SE model, potentially making it a more attractive option than the Apple iPhone 14. Reports suggest that the new model, internally referred to as 'Ghost', will feature advanced specifications including a 48-megapixel rear camera, USB-C port, and an action button, according to information leaked on Thursday.

The iPhone SE line has traditionally been considered less feature-rich and more affordable compared to other models. However, the latest leaks indicate a shift in this trend, with the upcoming iPhone SE 4 expected to bring in a new design inspired by the base model iPhone 14.

The iPhone SE 4 will maintain iPhone 14 test parameters for internal testing and will include an action button, a feature introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro models. It will also be equipped with a USB-C port, replacing the traditional lightning port used in previous models. The smartphone's single camera with flash is expected to align in an arrangement similar to the third-generation iPhone SE.

This would mark the first time an SE model will include Face ID feature. The display of the Apple iPhone SE 4 is also expected to be on par with the Apple iPhone 14. ""Preliminary information suggests that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 may feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, providing for a significant upgrade from the current model"", according to MacRumors.

While these upgrades seem ambitious for a budget model like the iPhone SE, it is suggested that these features will become cost-effective by the time of launch. The exact release date remains unclear, but reports indicate it could be in either 2024 or 2025.

The rumors around these features have not yet been confirmed by Apple and it remains uncertain which features will be available at launch. As such, consumers and tech enthusiasts are advised to stay tuned for further updates.

2022-09-28, IANS,World Heart Day: How heart health tools on Apple Watch can save many lives,https://in.investing.com/news/world-heart-day-how-heart-health-tools-on-apple-watch-can-save-many-lives-3827805,"New Delhi, Sep 28 (IANS) Ahead of World Heart Day on September 29, the World Heart Federation is encouraging people around the world to take care of their heart and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch, which has alerted several users around the world of potential signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), is one digital device that can be your health companion.Apple Watch Series 9, and previous models too, check for unusually high or low heart rates in the background, which could be signs of a serious underlying condition. This could help users identify situations that may warrant further evaluation.

If a user's heart rate is above 120 bpm or below 40 bpm while they appear to have been inactive for 10 minutes, they will receive a notification.

Users can adjust the threshold bpm or turn these notifications on or off. All heart rate notifications — along with date, time, and heart rate — can be viewed in the Health app on iPhone.

The irregular rhythm notification feature on your Apple Watch will occasionally look at your heartbeat to check for an irregular rhythm that might be suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AFib).

AFib is a type of irregular heart rhythm where the upper chambers of the heart beat out of sync with the lower chambers. Some individuals with AFib don’t experience any symptoms.

Others experience symptoms that could include rapid heartbeat, palpitations, fatigue, or shortness of breath.

Irregular rhythm notifications use the optical heart sensor on Apple Watch to detect the pulse wave at the wrist and look for variability in beat‑to‑beat intervals when the user is at rest.

If the algorithm repeatedly detects an irregular rhythm suggestive of AFib, you will receive a notification and the date, time, and beat‑to‑beat heart rate will be recorded in the Health app.

With the ECG app, users who experience symptoms, such as rapid or skipped heartbeat, can capture an ECG and record their symptoms.

The ECG app uses the electrical heart sensor built into the Digital Crown and the back crystal to record a single-lead ECG. The ECG app then provides a result of sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, atrial fibrillation with high heart rate, inconclusive, or poor recording, and prompts the user to enter any symptoms such as rapid or pounding heartbeat, dizziness, or fatigue.

The recorded waveform, results, date, time, and any symptoms are recorded and can be exported from the Health app as a PDF to share with a clinician.

The Cardio Fitness feature provides an estimate of VO2 Max, or your body's ability to intake oxygen during exercise.

Heart health experts recognize VO2 Max as a powerful predictor of overall health and Apple has brought this technology to all users as Apple Watch can give you a scientifically validated estimate of VO2 Max.

Users can even opt in to receive a notification if their classification drops to ""low,"" which is associated with risks of serious longterm health conditions. Fortunately, it is something you can improve by exercising more frequently or more rigorously, and something you can easily track along the way.

AFib History gives you an estimate of the amount to time your heart shows signs of AFib. This is important because research has shown the amount of time spent in AFib can relate to severity of symptoms, quality of life issues and risk of complications.

AFib History also allows users to track specific life factors like sleep, exercise and weight, which may influence the amount of time spent AFib.

Historically, there hasn't been an easy way to track AFib overtime or to compare them to important life factors. Now you can do this simply by wearing an Apple Watch.

2022-09-28, Investing.com,Google Pixel chips away at iPhone's dominance in Japan,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pixel-chips-away-at-iphones-dominance-in-japan-93CH-3827483,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google Pixel has made significant strides in the Japanese market, eroding the dominance of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s iPhone, according to data released on Thursday. The Google-owned smartphone brand has achieved a record 12% market share in the June quarter, marking a sixfold improvement from the same period last year.

The surge in Google Pixel's popularity comes after years of underwhelming performance and misfires in the Japanese market. Counterpoint Research, which provided the data, did not detail what led to this sudden upswing. It is clear that Google Pixel's gain has come at the expense of iPhone's market share.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which has long been a dominant player in Japan, saw its market share drop almost equivalently from 58% to 46%. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's market cap stands at a staggering $2.66 trillion with a P/E ratio of 28.48, indicating a strong market performance despite the recent decline in Japan. This decline coincides with the increasing price tags of iPhone models, although it remains unclear whether there is a direct correlation between these two events.

InvestingPro Tips reveals that Apple has been aggressively buying back shares and yields a high return on invested capital. Additionally, the company's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be an attractive feature for investors.

This shift in market dynamics indicates a changing landscape in Japan's smartphone industry. Although Apple still retains a significant portion of the market, the rise of Google Pixel suggests that Japanese consumers are exploring other options.

Google, with a market cap of $1.65 trillion and a P/E ratio of 27.66 according to InvestingPro data, has seen a large price uptick over the last six months. The company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has been a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry.

InvestingPro Tips for Google highlights that the company yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets. However, it's worth noting that Google does not pay a dividend to shareholders, unlike Apple.

Initially, speculations pointed towards the new A17 Pro chip as the potential cause of the problem. However, industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has clarified that changes made to the internal design of the models are responsible for the overheating.

Kuo explained that Apple compromised on the thermal system this year to maintain the weight of the device. The company might have used fewer heat dissipation techniques or materials to prevent an increase in the phone's weight. This alteration in the internal design is believed to be a significant factor behind the overheating issue.

Furthermore, Apple's decision to use titanium for the frame of these models has also contributed to the problem. Despite its durability and ability to withstand high drops, titanium has a detrimental impact on thermal efficiency. This material choice has led to an increase in device temperatures, with some users reporting temperatures as high as 46 degrees Celsius (116 degrees Fahrenheit).

In addition to these design factors, another potential cause for overheating has been identified. Apple stores in China have advised against using ""Android USB-C"" versions due to differences in pin arrangement between Android and Apple interfaces. The narrower spacing in the 9-pin and 11-pin connections may cause overheating when attached to the iPhone 15, potentially damaging the device's USB-C port.

Despite these issues, Kuo believes that software updates from Apple will likely only make a minor difference. These updates could restrict the processor's performance to prevent overheating but may not completely resolve the problem. The analyst further warns that these unresolved issues could negatively impact shipments of iPhone 15 Pro models.

Apple has not yet commented on these concerns. As of now, it remains unclear how customer warranties will be fulfilled if these overheating issues lead to device damage.

Treasury yields remain at multi-year highs as JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon of 7% interest rates

Treasury yields remained at their highest level in more than decade, with the at close to 4.54%, after JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon warned that the Federal Reserve could lift rates to 7%.

“I am not sure if the world is prepared for 7%,” Dimon told The Times of India in an interview. “I ask people in business, ‘Are you prepared for something like 7%?’ The worst case is 7% with stagflation.

With the Fed funds rate at 5.4%, the extra 200 basis points to push rates to 7% would “be more painful than the 3% to 5%” move,” Dimon added.

Tech resumes slide as higher rates bite

Big tech resumed its slide after brief respite on Monday as investors continue to price in the pain for growth stocks amid the prospect of higher for longer interest rate regime.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 2% to lead big tech lower, followed by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) as higher rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

Amazon drops after FTC, 17 state AGs file lawsuit

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 3% after the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit against the online retailer, alleging that it has used anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegal maintain a monopoly.

The FTC was joined in the lawsuit by 17 state attorney generals, alleging Amazon's actions stopped rivals and sellers from lower prices, stifled competition and degraded quality for shoppers.

Amazon’s general counsel and senior vice president of global public policy, David Zapolsky, refuted the allegations against the company, saying in a statement that ""the lawsuit filed by the FTC today is wrong on the facts and the law, and we look forward to making that case in court.”

Lawmakers in scramble to avert government shutdown

Lawmakers in Washington appear to be stepping up the pace to avert a government shutdown by the Oct. 1 deadline that would force the federal government to stop non-essential operations.

The Senate plans Tuesday to vote on a bill to extend government funding for 45 days, which if passed, would then proceed to the House for Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy to decide whether to bring it up for a vote.

But there isn’t a guarantee that it will pass the House as a group of conservative lawmakers are opposed to short-term funding extension."

According to StockApps.com financial analyst Edith, ""China has been a vital market for Apple (NASDAQ: ), contributing significantly to the company’s global sales. The Chinese market has seen remarkable growth and challenges for Apple in the past decade"".

Apple entered the Chinese smartphone market in 2010, and its sales soared over 20 times within five years. It peaked at $58.7 billion in 2015.

However, economic headwinds and increased competition led to a gradual decline in sales, which dropped to $40.3 billion in 2020, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the report said.

Nonetheless, China has once again become Apple's growth engine in the last two years.

Moreover, the report mentioned that the ban on iPhones for Chinese government officials is concerning for Apple as China accounts for 20 per cent of its sales, but this situation is not Apple’s first challenge in the country.

The ban comes from Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro flagship smartphone launch, which introduces a Chinese-made 7-nanometer processor.

This move raised eyebrows internationally given the US export ban on advanced semiconductors to China.

Despite these obstacles, Apple's ability to navigate the Chinese market is noteworthy. The company has demonstrated resilience by constantly evolving its strategies, the report stated.

Apple has customised its products and services to suit local preferences by incorporating features like dual SIM card support, better selfie cameras, and region-specific content on services such as Apple Music and the App Store.

Furthermore, the company has extended its retail footprint in China, opening stores in major cities to offer customers a physical space to experience its products and obtain assistance, according to the report.

According to data from Counterpoint Research, consumers are having to wait almost double the time for delivery of the basic iPhone 15 compared to its predecessor.

In China, Apple's largest market outside of its home country, the waiting period for the iPhone 15 has seen a fourfold increase. This trend is not just limited to the basic model. The premium iPhone 15 Pro Max has also set new records for pre-order waiting times.

Counterpoint Research attributes this surge in demand to significant upgrades made to both models. However, this increased interest in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max appears to have impacted other models in Apple's lineup. Both the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro have seen reduced waiting times, suggesting a shift in consumer preference towards the latest handsets.

While Apple's newest handsets are enjoying high demand leading to extended delivery times, older models such as the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 15 Pro are experiencing shorter wait times as consumers gravitate towards the newer offerings. This is particularly true in overseas markets like China, where waiting times have quadrupled.

Giving an example of mobile manufacturing, he said that in 2014, the country had zero mobile export and today, we are exporting Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) smartphones’ worth Rs 1 lakh crore.

“The sheer transformation in the electronics sector is the reason our Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes in India becoming a semiconductor nation,” said Chandrasekhar.

In 2014, the country used to import 82 per cent mobile phones and now, 100 per cent smartphones are being manufactured/assembled here.

“Similarly, in the near future, we will see more positive data on semiconductors as we begin the journey with the Micron (NASDAQ: ) plant. I have no doubt that the state-of-the-art plant in Sanand, Gujarat, will become a beacon to all investors, manufacturers and participants in the global semiconductor ecosystem,” Chandrasekhar told IANS.

The chip for ISRO-created GPS navigation system called NavIC -- now part of Apple iPhone 15 Pro series -- has been designed by Bengaluru-based Accord Software and Systems.

They've built more than a million NAVIC IC chips using advanced 28-nanometer technology.

The government will soon make it a “standard practice that all devices using GPS technology should have NAVIC-powered chipsets or NAVIC chips inside”.

“When you look at the IT PLI scheme this time, it includes incentives for system designers and manufacturers who incorporate Indian-designed chips into their products,” said Chandrasekhar.

The first India-made chip from the Rs 22,500 crore Micron plant is likely to arrive in December 2024.

The Assembly, Test, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) of the company is being set up on 93 acres in Sanand GIDC-II industrial estate and is expected to be commissioned within 18 months.

As usual, you can make and receive calls and messages, control your music, set a timer, and even pay for things right from your wrist.

Let us find out why Apple Watch series 9 is your companion 24/7 -- at home and on-the-go.

The wearable runs watchOS 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new watch faces, new cycling and hiking features, and tools to support mental health.

One of the most talked-about feature is Double Tap (available in a software update next month) that controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm.

With this gesture, you can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display.

You need to tap the index finger and thumb of the watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9.

The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch.

Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.

This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm.

The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap.

For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device.

For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses.

Now, Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries.

For example, you can ask how many hours of sleep you had the previous night, for progress on closing Activity rings, or about your blood glucose level if you have a connected monitor.

You can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as weight, period, or medications taken.

Another interesting feature this time on Apple Watch is to find a lost iPhone.

The S9 SiP custom Apple silicon includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 series, which has the same chip.

Precision Finding on Apple Watch will provide distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room.

Also, when you get within 4 metres of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media.

This time, the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display is up to 2,000 nits -- double that of Series 8 -- which makes it easier to read text in bright sunlight.

For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people around.

The watchOS 10 brings a new visual language to apps to see more information at a glance, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces.

You also get the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia.

It allows Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors for cyclists, unlocks new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and utilise the full screen.

With watchOS 10, you also get new watch faces: Snoopy, Palette, and Solar Analog.

For the first time, you can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch.

Apple Watch Series 9 starts at Rs 41,900 and Apple Watch SE is available for Rs 29,900.

Apple Watch Series 9 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes in starlight, midnight, silver, (PRODUCT)RED, and a new pink aluminium case, as well as stainless steel in , silver, and graphite cases — along with new Sport Loop band.

Conclusion: With new capabilities and innovations, the Apple Watch Series 9 is no doubt a delight to experience, whether you are upgrading from an earlier Watch series model or buying your first.

Apple Watch is now an indispensable companion to help you with your health, fitness, communications and safety.

Japanese futures remained steady on Sunday, while Australian futures and Hong Kong stock contracts experienced slight declines. In contrast, an index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies saw an increase, following the announcement that Washington and Beijing are setting up working groups to discuss economic and financial matters.

In early Monday trading in Asia, rose by 0.2%, recovering from Friday's equivalent fall that marked its poorest week since March. also increased by 0.2%, buoyed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s latest product sales which contributed to the stability of the underlying index on Friday.

The upcoming week will see U.S. Treasuries once again under scrutiny due to scheduled public appearances by Federal Reserve officials. Investors are also awaiting key U.S. inflation data and assessing the potential implications of a possible U.S. government shutdown.

According to market analyst Fawad Razaqzada from City Index and Forex.com, traders remain wary about inflation and policy direction in light of the recent oil surge and the Fed's hint that interest rates will not decrease in the near future.

Two Federal Reserve officials suggested last week that at least one more rate hike could be forthcoming, with borrowing costs potentially needing to stay high for a longer period for inflation to return to its 2% target. Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.

San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE: )'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.

In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while remained steady around $26,500.

The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak.

For example, you can ask how many hours of sleep you had the previous night, for progress on closing Activity rings, or about your blood glucose level if you have a connected monitor.

You can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as weight, period, or medications taken.

Another interesting feature this time on Apple Watch is to find a lost iPhone.

The S9 SiP custom Apple silicon includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 series, which has the same chip.

Precision Finding on Apple Watch will provide distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room.

Also, when you get within 4 metres of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media.

This time, the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display is up to 2,000 nits -- double that of Series 8 -- which makes it easier to read text in bright sunlight.

For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people around.

The watchOS 10 brings a new visual language to apps to see more information at a glance, a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed, and delightful new watch faces.

You also get the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia.

It allows Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors for cyclists, unlocks new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts will automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and utilise the full screen.

With watchOS 10, you also get new watch faces: Snoopy, Palette, and Solar Analog.

For the first time, you can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch.

Apple Watch Series 9 starts at Rs 41,900 and Apple Watch SE is available for Rs 29,900.

Apple Watch Series 9 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes in starlight, midnight, silver, (PRODUCT)RED, and a new pink aluminium case, as well as stainless steel in , silver, and graphite cases — along with new Sport Loop band.

Conclusion: With new capabilities and innovations, the Apple Watch Series 9 is no doubt a delight to experience, whether you are upgrading from an earlier Watch series model or buying your first.

Apple Watch is now an indispensable companion to help you with your health, fitness, communications and safety.

2022-09-24, Investing.com,Asian markets anticipate cautious start amid U.S. Federal Reserve policy implications,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-markets-anticipate-cautious-start-amid-us-federal-reserve-policy-implications-93CH-3821714,"Asian stock markets are preparing for a cautious commencement to the week today, as investors evaluate the potential impact of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy stance. Japanese futures remained steady on Sunday, while Australian futures and Hong Kong stock contracts experienced slight declines. In contrast, an index of U.S.-listed Chinese companies saw an increase, following the announcement that Washington and Beijing are setting up working groups to discuss economic and financial matters.

In early Monday trading in Asia, rose by 0.2%, recovering from Friday's equivalent fall that marked its poorest week since March. also increased by 0.2%, buoyed by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s latest product sales which contributed to the stability of the underlying index on Friday.

The upcoming week will see U.S. Treasuries once again under scrutiny due to scheduled public appearances by Federal Reserve officials. Investors are also awaiting key U.S. inflation data and assessing the potential implications of a possible U.S. government shutdown.

According to market analyst Fawad Razaqzada from City Index and Forex.com, traders remain wary about inflation and policy direction in light of the recent oil surge and the Fed's hint that interest rates will not decrease in the near future.

Two Federal Reserve officials suggested last week that at least one more rate hike could be forthcoming, with borrowing costs potentially needing to stay high for a longer period for inflation to return to its 2% target. Boston Fed President Susan Collins did not rule out further tightening, while Governor Michelle Bowman suggested that more than one increase might be necessary, reinforcing her status as one of the Federal Open Market Committee's most hawkish members.

San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly stated last week that it is premature to claim victory over inflation, reaffirming the central bank's continued commitment to manage price pressures as smoothly as possible.

Bank of America Corp (NYSE: )'s rate strategists predict that the yield on 10-year Treasuries could reach 4.75% before softer risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions drive it down by year-end.

In other market news, oil prices are approaching their annual high, while remained steady around $26,500.

The week ahead is packed with key events including speeches by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and ECB's Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Monday. This will be followed by the release of U.S. new home sales data and Conference Board consumer confidence on Tuesday, with ECB's Philip Lane also scheduled to speak. Other highlights include China's industrial profits data and U.S. durable goods data on Wednesday, Eurozone economic and consumer confidence data on Thursday, and U.S. initial jobless claims and GDP data.

According to The Verge, Google last year launched a ""Get the Message"" campaign to put pressure on Apple to support RCS on the iPhone, which is still ongoing today with ""iPager"".

""iPager isn’t real, but the problems that Apple causes by using SMS are,"" said Google in the video description on YouTube.

""Let’s make texting better for everyone and help Apple #GetTheMessage and upgrade to RCS,"" it added.

RCS enhances messaging by providing end-to-end encryption, read receipts, and the ability to share high-resolution photos and videos.

iMessage provides similar features, but only for messages sent between other iMessage users, making Android users appear as green message bubble nuisances in group messages -- a real issue in countries like the US, where more than half of the population owns an iPhone, the report said.

Google ended the video with a link to Android.com/GetTheMessage and the new animated mascot.

The campaign has been underway for one year, and iOS 17 just became available as a new update to Apple's operating system. However, there’s no support for RCS there.

U.S. Federal Reserve officials said further rate hikes could be required as inflation remains too hot for comfort.

The analyst comments ""The iPhone 15 lineup has been available for pre-order in most geographies since Sep 15th , and lead times for the Pro model have jumped rather significantly, and to a lesser extent for the Plus model, relative to a week ago. All delivery times referenced are for delivery of a “sim-free” phone from the Apple website. We would also note that delivery times referenced here represent the free delivery option, though in the U.S., some iPhone 15 models can be delivered faster should the customer choose to pay an extra delivery fee. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are now seeing time to first delivery estimates of 35 days for both in the US, while China carries slightly lower lead times of 25 and 32 days respectively. Other countries we track are very similar to US lead times at >30 days on average for the Pro/Pro Max models, with Japan having the highest lead times at 39 days. We note that the Pro model lead times have accelerated from 7- 18 days previously to now 25-39 days. The lower-end models (15 Plus and 15 base) have significantly shorter delivery times across all regions (9-18 days), which points to a strong mix of higher priced iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. However, on an absolute basis, the lower-end model lead times have improved significantly vs. Sep 15th . As such, compared to last year, delivery times are comparable for the Pro Max, higher for the Pro and 15 base model, and slightly lower for the Plus. Finally, we would also caveat that delivery times could be a reflection of strong demand or weak supply – though we suspect given the variation in wait times that this data set more likely suggests higher demand. Net/net: The data points to robust demand for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, although slightly weaker on Plus vs. last year, which could have a positive impact on mix alongside higher volumes. Maintain Outperform and $210 target."""
2022-09-22, Investing.com,Qualcomm plans job cuts in Shanghai amid U.S.-China tech tensions and economic challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-plans-job-cuts-in-shanghai-amid-uschina-tech-tensions-and-economic-challenges-93CH-3820422,"The US chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly planning job cuts at its Shanghai office, amid escalating technology tensions between the US and China, as well as ongoing economic challenges. The company confirmed the layoffs but has not disclosed the exact number of job reductions. This move follows Qualcomm's previously announced expectations of ""workforce reductions"" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of its restructuring efforts to invest in key growth opportunities.

Despite the layoffs, Qualcomm has denied plans for an office closure or a complete withdrawal from Shanghai, according to China Business News. An anonymous employee also confirmed that the layoffs were underway, but suggested they were not extensive.

The company, which has a presence in over 12 Chinese cities primarily for its semiconductor and mobile telecommunications businesses, has emphasized its commitment to developing advanced technology in China. It is offering generous redundancy packages to affected employees.

Qualcomm's decision comes in the wake of a challenging financial period. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, it reported a 23% year-on-year drop in revenue and a 52% decline in net income due to weak demand for consumer electronics.

Additional pressure comes from ongoing US-China trade tensions and Beijing’s partial ban on iPhone usage by government staff, as Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ: ). However, the successful launch of the new iPhone 15 in Mainland China could alleviate some of these challenges.

The broader smartphone market in China has also faced difficulties, with a 4% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2022, marking the lowest second-quarter sales since 2014, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Other US chip companies have likewise announced job cuts in China amid these economic challenges and industrial downturns.

People bought India-made iPhone 15 along with high-end Pro models at Apple Saket in New Delhi and Apple BKC in Mumbai -- along with at other Apple Authorised resellers stores amid long queues since early morning.

At Apple Delhi and Mumbai retail stores, those who had pre-ordered their iPhones queued up early to get their devices.

""It’s amazing to be back in India celebrating the launch of our incredible new products with our teams and customers at Apple BKC,"" said Wendy Beckman, Senior Market Director, EMEIA.

""Our teams are so excited to be sharing the all new iPhone 15 lineup, and our new Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 featuring our first-ever carbon neutral models,"" Beckman said in a statement.

Several buyers were also seen with the high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max models in their hands, confirming the premiumisation trend that is now maturing in the country.

""It was great to get hold of a ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15. Such a proud feeling. I anxiously waited for this day after pre-booking my iPhone on Apple Online,"" said Divyam, 21, who came from Faridabad to the Apple Saket store.

Long queues were also seen at Apple BKC, with retail staff cheering the first buyers of the new iPhones and Watch Series 9.

Apple had received nearly 50 per cent surge in pre-orders this time for the iPhone 15 series. Apple doubling the pre-orders from last year’s iPhone 14 series indicates the company has made deeper inroads in the Indian smartphone market, also driven by an uptick in first-time users who are shifting from Android to the Apple ecosystem and a young, aspirational population.

According to insights from CyberMedia Research, over 85 per cent of shipments in the iPhone 14 series were non-Pro models.

""This year, the iPhone 15 stands out with substantial enhancements, such as the dynamic island and a 48MP camera, making it an attractive choice for upgraders and even potential switchers,"" Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

Easier access to financing and greater resale value is making premium iPhones more and more accessible to the mainstream users in the country. ""With iPhone 15 base version now being made in India from the onset, if Apple decides to make the pricing of the new iPhones more attractive in coming months, it could have a blockbuster Diwali season,"" said Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research.

iPhone being one of the most aspirational smartphones, coupled with big features upgrade for the iPhone 15 series, is attracting those increasingly ‘smartphone dependent’ users to upgrade to the best, Shah added.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Accordingly, Google is mulling transitioning to an in-house design by as early as 2027. This decision was influenced by pricing disputes between Google and Broadcom regarding TPUs.

Wells Fargo analysts commented that AVGO losing Google “would be a multi-billion dollar annual impact”.

“The company's Custom Silicon business which includes the TPU, YouTube video encoding chips, Meta's MTIA, and more has been one of the fastest-growing segments of Broadcom's business which represents several billion dollars a year in revenue; Google TPUs making up the majority,” analysts wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA analysts believe this article could be a part of the campaign to lower prices and a contract negotiation tactic, rather than something investors should be worried about.

“Developing internal chips completely internally by systems/cloud customers is easy to say, but often really hard to do in its practice as Apple recently discovered when it unsuccessfully tried to replace Qualcomm’s 5G modem,” analysts noted.

“The choice is either to Buy off the shelf (merchant silicon) from NVDA or others and/or or engage in multiyear custom internal designs (ASIC) in partnerships with the likes of AVGO, MRVL and their Taiwanese peers. Either way, there is no low-cost short cut given the significant design IP and manufacturing scale/expertise that mainstream chip companies bring to the table.”"

Meanwhile, the Centre has also asked the PC and laptop companies to share their import data for the last three years, according to an industry source.

The process of import authorisation for laptops and tablets, etc will be online via the ""import management system"" website, managed by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).

The portal that will cater to mobile phones, IT and telecom products.will go live by the end of September, according to sources.

The government, meanwhile, reiterated its stand at the meeting that the restrictions are not to ban imports but to promote exports via domestic manufacturing, according to sources.

Top consumer electronics companies had earlier urged the government to extend the November 1 deadline for the licences required for PCs, laptops and tablets by at least an year, as it will take time to configure and set up manufacturing/assembling units as per new guidelines.

Earlier this month, PC and laptop makers met the IT Ministry officials to rethink its decision on import licensing requirements accompanied by a quota.

The meeting discussed proposed changes, like linking the import of IT hardware to the local manufacturing of a company value and its export value of electronic items, according to sources.

Last month, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) wrote to the IT Ministry, requesting the government to rethink its decision on import licensing requirement accompanied by a quota, which was extended by 3 months until October 31, fearing that this may lead to price rise in consumer electronics products as companies are not yet prepared for manufacturing PCs, laptops and servers domestically at scale.

The letter said that an overarching factor that should be taken into consideration in ""avoiding supply chain disruption till domestic production ramps up"" is that any ""reduction in supplies or even an indication will lead to hoarding and market distortion"".

This, in turn, can push up consumer prices, ""which will adversely impact not just key stakeholders such as students, but also those who are the core of growing the digital economy, i.e. start-ups, IT and ITES firms, BPOs"".

The Central government had deferred its decision to restrict the import of certain categories of laptops and computers until November 1, allowing companies three-months time to import these devices.

Post November 1, no entity was to be allowed to import laptops, computers, and related items without a license.

2022-09-22, IANS,Centre aims to meet 70% of India’s IT hardware demand through domestic production,https://in.investing.com/news/centre-aims-to-meet-70-of-indias-it-hardware-demand-through-domestic-production-3820013,"New Delhi, Sep 22 (IANS) The Central government plans to meet up to 70 per cent of the country's demand for IT hardware through domestic production within the next three years and cut dependence on imports from non-trusted sources, Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Friday.""At present, almost 80 per cent of our supplies to the digital ecosystem come from imports and only 8-10 per cent of our supply requirement comes from India. We want to make that 65-70 per cent in the next three years,"" the minister told journalists.

Close to 40 companies, including global giants such as HP and Dell, have applied under the IT hardware PLI (productivity linked incentive) scheme for setting up factories to manufacture personal computers, laptops, tablets, servers and other equipment. The value works out to around Rs 4.65 lakh crore during the scheme period. The restrictions that are being introduced on imports are expected to trigger a surge in domestic investment.

Chandrasekhar said a draft of IT hardware import rules will be discussed with industry players later in the day as part of the strategy to reduce dependence on imports from non-trusted sources, which is an oblique reference to China.

Senior officials also point out that India’s trade deficit with China has soared to unsustainable levels and in any case there is a need to reduce imports from the Asian neighbour.

The government has already announced a clamp down on imports and has given a transition period of about three months till October31, before a new licensing regime for imports of laptops, tablets and personal computers comes into effect.

The government has issued a notification that import consignments can be cleared till October 31 without a licence and a government permit would be required for clearance of import from November.

The import restrictions are also expected to affect technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) who are now expected to increase their investments in India.

Let us find out why iPhone 15 is your go-to device -- for an upgrade or a first-time experience.

First and foremost, it is iPhone 15 (of course!). Available in 6.1-inch, it now has the Dynamic Island functionality, an innovative way to interact with important alerts and Live Activities.

The experience fluidly expands and adapts so you can see the next direction in Maps, easily control music, and, with third-party app integrations, get real-time updates on food delivery, ride sharing, sports scores, travel plans, and more.

The Super Retina XDR display on the deice is great for watching content and playing games.

Peak HDR brightness now reaches up to 1,600 nits so HDR photos and videos look better than ever.

When it is sunny, peak outdoor brightness reaches up to 2,000 nits -- twice as bright as the previous generation.

Design-wise, the device features a sophisticated new look that’s built to last.

For the first time in a smartphone, colour is infused throughout the back glass, creating five beautiful colours, with a new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminium enclosure.

The back glass is strengthened with an optimised dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish.

The Ceramic Shield front cover continues to be tougher than any other smartphone glass.

With a water- and dust-resistant design and industry-leading durability features, iPhone 15 lasts and holds its value longer than any other smartphone.

Now, on the camera.

For the first time, the 48MP Main camera on an iPhone base model shoots sharp photos and videos while capturing fine details, with a quad-pixel sensor and 100 per cent Focus Pixels for fast autofocus.

Using the power of computational photography, the Main camera gives you a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing.

By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option will give you three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — also for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

Moreover, you can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode, also a first.

So you can click your dog or cat in the frame and turn those photos into portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken.

When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app.

This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online.

These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth front camera.

On the performance side, A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more.

The 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering much better battery life.

The 5-core GPU has 50 per cent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games.

iOS 17 makes your iPhone 15 even more personal and intuitive with major updates to communication apps — StandBy, a new way to experience iPhone when it is charging, easier sharing with AirDrop, and more intelligent input that improves the speed and accuracy of typing.

The Phone app has received a big update that makes the calls that matter stand out even more.

You can now leave a video or audio message on FaceTime to capture exactly what you want to say when someone you call is not available.

AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues.

NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, will let users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing iPhone devices together.

Available in 6.1-inch display size, iPhone 15 is now available in pink, yellow, green, blue and black finishes in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities, starting at Rs 79,900.

Conclusion: Apart from the ‘Make in India’ feel, iPhone 15 a huge leap forward for iPhone with a gorgeous design featuring a durable, colour-infused back glass and new contoured edge, the Dynamic Island, a 48MP Main camera with 2x Telephoto and USB‑C.

Several buyers were also seen with iPhone 15 Pro Max boxes in their hands, again confirming the premiumisation trend that is now maturing in the country.

Long queues were also seen at Apple BKC, with retail staff cheering the first buyers of the new iPhones and Watch Series 9.

Apple, which started handing over ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 as well as locally-assembled iPhone 15 Plus to the Indian users, received nearly 50 per cent surge in pre-orders this time for the iPhone 15 series.

Apple doubling the pre-orders from last year’s iPhone 14 series indicates the company has made deeper inroads in the Indian smartphone market, also driven by an uptick in first-time users who are shifting from Android to the Apple ecosystem and a young, aspirational population.

According to insights from CyberMedia Research, over 85 per cent of shipments in the iPhone 14 series were non-Pro models.

“This year, the iPhone 15 stands out with substantial enhancements, such as the dynamic island and a 48MP camera, making it an attractive choice for upgraders and even potential switchers,” Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

Easier access to financing and greater resale value is making premium iPhones more and more accessible to the mainstream users in the country.

“With iPhone 15 base version now being made in India from the onset, if Apple decides to make the pricing of the new iPhones more attractive in coming months, it could have a blockbuster Diwali season,” according to Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research.

iPhone being one of the most aspirational smartphones, coupled with big features upgrade for the iPhone 15 series, is attracting those increasingly ‘smartphone dependent’ users to upgrade to the best, Shah added.

iPhone maker Foxconn is assembling both iPhone 15 and 15 Plus at its Sriperumbudur plant in Tamil Nadu (NS: ).

Both the ‘Make in India’ iPhones will also be exported to other countries as well, which is also first for the country.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

According to The Verge, Google last year launched a ""Get the Message"" campaign to put pressure on Apple to support RCS on the iPhone, which is still ongoing today with ""iPager"".

""iPager isn’t real, but the problems that Apple causes by using SMS are,"" said Google in the video description on YouTube.

""Let’s make texting better for everyone and help Apple #GetTheMessage and upgrade to RCS,"" it added.

RCS enhances messaging by providing end-to-end encryption, read receipts, and the ability to share high-resolution photos and videos.

iMessage provides similar features, but only for messages sent between other iMessage users, making Android users appear as green message bubble nuisances in group messages -- a real issue in countries like the US, where more than half of the population owns an iPhone, the report said.

Google ended the video with a link to Android.com/GetTheMessage and the new animated mascot.

The campaign has been underway for one year, and iOS 17 just became available as a new update to Apple's operating system. However, there’s no support for RCS there.

The analyst comments ""The iPhone 15 lineup has been available for pre-order in most geographies since Sep 15th , and lead times for the Pro model have jumped rather significantly, and to a lesser extent for the Plus model, relative to a week ago. All delivery times referenced are for delivery of a “sim-free” phone from the Apple website. We would also note that delivery times referenced here represent the free delivery option, though in the U.S., some iPhone 15 models can be delivered faster should the customer choose to pay an extra delivery fee. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are now seeing time to first delivery estimates of 35 days for both in the US, while China carries slightly lower lead times of 25 and 32 days respectively. Other countries we track are very similar to US lead times at >30 days on average for the Pro/Pro Max models, with Japan having the highest lead times at 39 days. We note that the Pro model lead times have accelerated from 7- 18 days previously to now 25-39 days. The lower-end models (15 Plus and 15 base) have significantly shorter delivery times across all regions (9-18 days), which points to a strong mix of higher priced iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. However, on an absolute basis, the lower-end model lead times have improved significantly vs. Sep 15th . As such, compared to last year, delivery times are comparable for the Pro Max, higher for the Pro and 15 base model, and slightly lower for the Plus. Finally, we would also caveat that delivery times could be a reflection of strong demand or weak supply – though we suspect given the variation in wait times that this data set more likely suggests higher demand. Net/net: The data points to robust demand for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, although slightly weaker on Plus vs. last year, which could have a positive impact on mix alongside higher volumes. Maintain Outperform and $210 target."""
2022-09-22, Investing.com,Qualcomm plans job cuts in Shanghai amid U.S.-China tech tensions and economic challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-plans-job-cuts-in-shanghai-amid-uschina-tech-tensions-and-economic-challenges-93CH-3820422,"The US chip giant Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly planning job cuts at its Shanghai office, amid escalating technology tensions between the US and China, as well as ongoing economic challenges. The company confirmed the layoffs but has not disclosed the exact number of job reductions. This move follows Qualcomm's previously announced expectations of ""workforce reductions"" in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of its restructuring efforts to invest in key growth opportunities.

Despite the layoffs, Qualcomm has denied plans for an office closure or a complete withdrawal from Shanghai, according to China Business News. An anonymous employee also confirmed that the layoffs were underway, but suggested they were not extensive.

The company, which has a presence in over 12 Chinese cities primarily for its semiconductor and mobile telecommunications businesses, has emphasized its commitment to developing advanced technology in China. It is offering generous redundancy packages to affected employees.

Qualcomm's decision comes in the wake of a challenging financial period. In the third quarter of fiscal 2022, it reported a 23% year-on-year drop in revenue and a 52% decline in net income due to weak demand for consumer electronics.

Additional pressure comes from ongoing US-China trade tensions and Beijing’s partial ban on iPhone usage by government staff, as Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple (NASDAQ: ). However, the successful launch of the new iPhone 15 in Mainland China could alleviate some of these challenges.

The broader smartphone market in China has also faced difficulties, with a 4% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2022, marking the lowest second-quarter sales since 2014, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Other US chip companies have likewise announced job cuts in China amid these economic challenges and industrial downturns.

Accordingly, Google is mulling transitioning to an in-house design by as early as 2027. This decision was influenced by pricing disputes between Google and Broadcom regarding TPUs.

Wells Fargo analysts commented that AVGO losing Google “would be a multi-billion dollar annual impact”.

“The company's Custom Silicon business which includes the TPU, YouTube video encoding chips, Meta's MTIA, and more has been one of the fastest-growing segments of Broadcom's business which represents several billion dollars a year in revenue; Google TPUs making up the majority,” analysts wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA analysts believe this article could be a part of the campaign to lower prices and a contract negotiation tactic, rather than something investors should be worried about.

“Developing internal chips completely internally by systems/cloud customers is easy to say, but often really hard to do in its practice as Apple recently discovered when it unsuccessfully tried to replace Qualcomm’s 5G modem,” analysts noted.

“The choice is either to Buy off the shelf (merchant silicon) from NVDA or others and/or or engage in multiyear custom internal designs (ASIC) in partnerships with the likes of AVGO, MRVL and their Taiwanese peers. Either way, there is no low-cost short cut given the significant design IP and manufacturing scale/expertise that mainstream chip companies bring to the table.”"

2022-09-22, IANS,"India likely to defer import curbs on PC, laptop manufacturers by 9-12 months",https://in.investing.com/news/india-likely-to-defer-import-curbs-on-pc-laptop-manufacturers-by-912-months-3820191,"New Delhi, Sep 22 (IANS) In a respite for global PC and laptop manufacturers, the government is likely to defer import duty curbs on PCs, laptops and tablets by at least 9-12 months from the October 30 deadline, while asking them to register for the new import process, industry people close to the development told IANS on Friday.The move is set to be a breather for companies like HP, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Dell, Lenovo and others who rely on imports to meet the surge in demand in the country for their PCs, laptops and tablets, especially in the festive season ahead.

Meanwhile, the Centre has also asked the PC and laptop companies to share their import data for the last three years, according to an industry source.

The process of import authorisation for laptops and tablets, etc will be online via the ""import management system"" website, managed by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).

The portal that will cater to mobile phones, IT and telecom products.will go live by the end of September, according to sources.

The government, meanwhile, reiterated its stand at the meeting that the restrictions are not to ban imports but to promote exports via domestic manufacturing, according to sources.

Top consumer electronics companies had earlier urged the government to extend the November 1 deadline for the licences required for PCs, laptops and tablets by at least an year, as it will take time to configure and set up manufacturing/assembling units as per new guidelines.

Earlier this month, PC and laptop makers met the IT Ministry officials to rethink its decision on import licensing requirements accompanied by a quota.

The meeting discussed proposed changes, like linking the import of IT hardware to the local manufacturing of a company value and its export value of electronic items, according to sources.

Last month, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) wrote to the IT Ministry, requesting the government to rethink its decision on import licensing requirement accompanied by a quota, which was extended by 3 months until October 31, fearing that this may lead to price rise in consumer electronics products as companies are not yet prepared for manufacturing PCs, laptops and servers domestically at scale.

The letter said that an overarching factor that should be taken into consideration in ""avoiding supply chain disruption till domestic production ramps up"" is that any ""reduction in supplies or even an indication will lead to hoarding and market distortion"".

This, in turn, can push up consumer prices, ""which will adversely impact not just key stakeholders such as students, but also those who are the core of growing the digital economy, i.e. start-ups, IT and ITES firms, BPOs"".

The Central government had deferred its decision to restrict the import of certain categories of laptops and computers until November 1, allowing companies three-months time to import these devices.

Post November 1, no entity was to be allowed to import laptops, computers, and related items without a license.

We want to make that 65-70 per cent in the next three years,"" the minister told journalists.

Close to 40 companies, including global giants such as HP and Dell, have applied under the IT hardware PLI (productivity linked incentive) scheme for setting up factories to manufacture personal computers, laptops, tablets, servers and other equipment. The value works out to around Rs 4.65 lakh crore during the scheme period. The restrictions that are being introduced on imports are expected to trigger a surge in domestic investment.

Chandrasekhar said a draft of IT hardware import rules will be discussed with industry players later in the day as part of the strategy to reduce dependence on imports from non-trusted sources, which is an oblique reference to China.

Senior officials also point out that India’s trade deficit with China has soared to unsustainable levels and in any case there is a need to reduce imports from the Asian neighbour.

The government has already announced a clamp down on imports and has given a transition period of about three months till October31, before a new licensing regime for imports of laptops, tablets and personal computers comes into effect.

The government has issued a notification that import consignments can be cleared till October 31 without a licence and a government permit would be required for clearance of import from November.

The import restrictions are also expected to affect technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) who are now expected to increase their investments in India.

When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app.

This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online.

The Phone app has received a big update that makes the calls that matter stand out even more.

You can now leave a video or audio message on FaceTime to capture exactly what you want to say when someone you call is not available.

AirDrop makes it easier than ever to share with friends, family, and colleagues.

NameDrop, a new AirDrop feature, will let users exchange contact information, including their Contact Poster, simply by bringing iPhone devices together.

Available in 6.1-inch display size, iPhone 15 is now available in pink, yellow, green, blue and black finishes in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities, starting at Rs 79,900.

“It was great to get hold of a ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15. Such a proud feeling. I anxiously waited for this day after pre-booking my iPhone on Apple Online,” said Divyam, 21, who came from Faridabad to the Apple Saket store.

Several buyers were also seen with iPhone 15 Pro Max boxes in their hands, again confirming the premiumisation trend that is now maturing in the country.

Long queues were also seen at Apple BKC, with retail staff cheering the first buyers of the new iPhones and Watch Series 9.

Apple, which started handing over ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 as well as locally-assembled iPhone 15 Plus to the Indian users, received nearly 50 per cent surge in pre-orders this time for the iPhone 15 series.

“With iPhone 15 base version now being made in India from the onset, if Apple decides to make the pricing of the new iPhones more attractive in coming months, it could have a blockbuster Diwali season,” according to Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research.

iPhone being one of the most aspirational smartphones, coupled with big features upgrade for the iPhone 15 series, is attracting those increasingly ‘smartphone dependent’ users to upgrade to the best, Shah added.

iPhone maker Foxconn is assembling both iPhone 15 and 15 Plus at its Sriperumbudur plant in Tamil Nadu (NS: ).

Both the ‘Make in India’ iPhones will also be exported to other countries as well, which is also first for the country.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,"Apple’s In-House 5G Modem Project Faces Setbacks, Extends Qualcomm Partnership",https://in.investing.com/news/apples-inhouse-5g-modem-project-faces-setbacks-extends-qualcomm-partnership-93CH-3818849,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has recently extended its 5G modem partnership with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) for an additional three years, indicating potential challenges with the development of its in-house modem, codenamed 'Sinope'. This decision follows reports that the first prototypes of Apple's 5G modem were not only slow but also prone to overheating, making them significantly inferior to Qualcomm's current versions.

The extended agreement with Qualcomm will cover smartphone launches in 2024, 2025, and 2026, according to a statement by Qualcomm. The companies' previous agreement was set to expire this year, and the upcoming iPhone was expected to be one of the last relying on Qualcomm modems.

A Wall Street Journal report revealed that Apple's in-house 5G modems are estimated to be three years behind Qualcomm. The report also highlighted issues such as poor communication between managers and lofty ambitions as factors contributing to the project's delay.

The development of the in-house modem began in 2018 under the leadership of former wireless director Jaydeep Ranade. Despite Apple's unmatched prowess in the custom silicon segment, it faced difficulties in developing a modem that complied with strict connectivity regulations worldwide and was compatible with different wireless carriers.

Apple had initially planned to debut its custom-built 5G modem in iPhones starting in 2025. However, given the performance and efficiency challenges faced by the prototypes, there is a chance that the company might postpone the official launch again.

Previous reports had suggested Apple would debut its custom-built 5G modem as early as 2022. However, these expectations seem to have been dashed as unnamed Apple executives acknowledged that their first custom 5G chips were far behind Qualcomm's leading Snapdragon X75 modem.

It is now uncertain whether Apple will unveil its first in-house 5G modem during the iPhone 16 announcement next year. Despite acquiring Intel (NASDAQ: )'s smartphone modem business in July 2019 and adding 2,200 Intel engineers to its chipset operations globally, Apple's ambitious project seems to be facing significant hurdles.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Apple's AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case now available at a discount,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-airpods-pro-with-usbc-charging-case-now-available-at-a-discount-93CH-3818782,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s latest addition to its audio product line, the new AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case, has been released and is already on sale just over a week after its launch. This new model is being offered at a 20% discount, priced at $200 on Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The transition to a USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro aligns with Apple's recent shift to USB-C on the iPhone 15. The change was anticipated well ahead of its release due to various leaks. This modification aims to reduce cable clutter and even allows for the earbuds to be charged directly from an iPhone 15.

The new AirPods Pro model carries over the H2 chip from the Vision Pro headset, which will support low-latency lossless audio when the device launches next year. However, this has sparked some controversy as previous AirPods Pro models with a Lightning charging case will not be compatible with Vision Pro.

The new model also boasts improved weatherproofing, with the rating upgraded from IPX4 to IP54, providing dust protection. Despite these enhancements, they are largely similar to the previous 2nd-generation version in terms of features. They offer superior audio quality and active noise cancellation performance compared to the first-gen AirPods Pro.

In addition to these changes, Apple has retained user-favorite features such as hands-free access to Siri, seamless switching between iCloud-connected devices, and added volume control.

The second generation of AirPods Pro was released in 2022 and received a product refresh in 2022. The newer model is not only equipped with a USB-C charging case but is also dust resistant, enhancing the earbuds' already water-resistant design.

Despite these improvements, if consumers already own the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro, it may not be worth upgrading to the latest model. However, for those in the market for a new pair, the current discount offers a great deal for such a recently launched product.

This comes as a positive surprise, suggesting that smartphones are less of a discretionary purchase than previously assumed.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Wedbush reported a robust start to the sales cycle of the new iPhone model based on pre-order data. The high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max has been particularly successful. A Credit Suisse (SIX: ) analyst also noted extended lead times for orders of this model, indicating strong demand.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: )' analyst Michael Ng echoed this positive sentiment, stating that while there isn't much visibility into iPhone supply, it is evident that demand is surpassing supply. Ng set a 12-month price target for Apple stock at $216. Other analysts from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush, and Credit Suisse have set their targets at $215, $240, and $220 respectively.

Given that iPhones constitute over half of Apple's revenue, such a surge in demand for the latest models—especially the more expensive ones—provides encouraging news for investors.

However, not all analysts align with this optimistic trend. Barclays (LON: ) analyst Tim Long suggested potential challenges for iPhone 15 sales in China based on his examination of pre-orders. He noted a slight preference for lower-priced models compared to last year's mix and set a 12-month price target for Apple stock at $167.

Apple's Greater China segment represents about 19% of its fiscal 2022 sales. Therefore, any difficulties in this major market could impact Apple's stock performance. However, Long's analysis also reveals a silver lining: he estimates only a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall unit orders in the Chinese market. Given recent media consensus that China's recovery is stalling, this minor decline suggests that potential iPhone sales drops in China may not significantly hinder overall performance, particularly considering potential strength in North America and other markets.

In conclusion, despite the uncertain economic climate, demand for Apple's new iPhone models appears to be outpacing supply—an encouraging sign for investors.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Apple 'spectacularly' failed to develop its own silicon chip - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-spectacularly-failed-to-develop-its-own-silicon-chip--wsj-432SI-3818433,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has failed in developing its own silicon chip that would allow it to cut its partnership with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), a report in the WSJ noted.

The new iPhone models launched recently lack a proprietary silicon chip that Apple had invested significant time and resources in developing.

This initiative, initiated by Apple's CEO Tim Cook in 2018, aimed to design and produce a modem chip, responsible for connecting iPhones to wireless carriers, with the objective of reducing Apple's dependence on Qualcomm, a dominant chip supplier in the modem market.

However, the challenges faced in completing this chip project were primarily due to Apple's own decisions, the WSJ report notes citing former company engineers and executives familiar with the project.

The chip was initially intended to be included in the new iPhone models, but testing in late 2022 revealed issues such as slow performance and overheating. Moreover, the chip's physical size was so large that it would occupy half of an iPhone's space, rendering it impractical for use.

Investors had anticipated cost savings from an in-house chip, especially in the face of sluggish demand in the broader smartphone market. Nonetheless, Apple is estimated to have paid Qualcomm over $7.2 billion for chips in the previous year.

Engineering teams working on Apple's modem chip faced various challenges, including technical hurdles, poor communication, and managerial disagreements over whether to design the chips internally or procure them externally.

“Just because Apple builds the best silicon on the planet, it’s ridiculous to think that they could also build a modem,” the former Apple wireless director Jaydeep Ranade, told WSJ.

Apple executives gained a clearer understanding of the project's challenges when the company tested its modem chip prototypes in late 2022. The results of these tests were far from satisfactory, according to WSJ, as the tested chips were found to be lagging behind Qualcomm's top-performing modem chip by approximately three years in terms of technological advancement and capabilities.

Earlier this month, Qualcomm announced it will continue to supply Apple with iPhone 5G modems until 2026."

This downturn came in the wake of the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its key rate steady at between 5.25% and 5.50%. However, the Fed signaled a potential additional rate hike later this year, a move that has been interpreted as a hawkish outlook on its monetary policy.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell explained the stance, stating, ""We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate, and we intend to hold policy at a restrictive level until we are confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward our objectives.""

Consequently, the Asian stock markets underperformed overall due to concerns over the lengthening of the United States' monetary tightening stance,"" according to Kim Seok-hwan, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities Co.

Bond prices also closed lower, with the yield on three-year Treasurys adding 4.0 basis points to 3.930% and the return on the benchmark five-year government bonds advancing 5.7 basis points to 3.973%.

""In 2009, the Office of Tailored Access Operations started to infiltrate servers at Huawei's headquarters and continued conducting such surveillance operations,"" the post read.

The ‘Second Date’ malware is “cyber-espionage malware developed by the US National Security Agency, which operates covertly in thousands of networks in many countries around the world.""

With this spyware, “the US had obtained control over tens of thousands of devices and stolen a substantial amount of high-value data,"" the ministry said in the post.

Amid the escalating rivalry between the US and China, earlier this month, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan revealed that the Joe Biden government seeks to know more about the new, ‘made in China’ Huawei chipset used in the Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

In a note, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) chief economist Ellen Zentner said: “A further hike this year remains an option, and the message of higher for longer was hammered home in fewer rate cuts in 2024, and an end-26 median funds rate at 2.875 per cent.”

The Australian sharemarket was set to open higher, with futures pointing to a rise of 15 points, or 0.2 per cent at the open.

Federal Reserve skips rate hike, but leans into higher-for-longer stance

The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and kept its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but signaled a higher-for-longer rate regime by reining in the number of rate cuts for next year.

""The bottom-line is that the Fed is embracing the 'higher for longer' approach to getting inflation down to target,"" Jefferies said in a note.

Powell attributed the more hawkish path to recent strength in the economy that threatens to boost inflation.

""The stronger economic activity means that we have to do more with rates,"" Powell said, addressing a question on why the Fed reduced the number of rate cuts for next year.

Treasury yields rebound to close at more than decade highs to pressure big tech

Treasury yields including the and yields cut intraday losses and surged to close at fresh cycle highs after the Fed decision.

The 2-year Treasury yield, which is more sensitive to interest rate decisions, closed at 5.120%, the highest level since 2006, after falling to a low of 5.049% on the day.

Growth sectors of the marketing including big tech came under pressure from rising Treasury yields, paced by a more than 3% in Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

2022-09-20, Investing.com,Apple and Goldman Sachs halt plans for iPhone stock trading feature,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-goldman-sachs-halt-plans-for-iphone-stock-trading-feature-93CH-3816869,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) had been planning to co-develop a stock trading app similar to Robin Hood for iPhones, but the project has reportedly been abandoned, according to unnamed sources cited by CNBC on Wednesday. The feature would have allowed users to buy and sell stocks directly from their iPhones, potentially rivaling existing trading apps such as Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) and Cash App. However, the reasons behind the decision to shelve the project remain unclear.

The project reportedly began in 2020 during a period of historically low-interest rates and record interest in share trading, fueled by the meme stock bonanza. The initial rollout was scheduled for 2022. However, as market conditions worsened last year, Apple and Goldman Sachs decided to put the project on hold due to concerns over potential backlash if users lost money in the stock market. Instead, efforts were redirected towards Apple Savings, which offers high yields for users compared to traditional savings accounts.

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the infrastructure for the project is ""mostly built"" and could be launched if Apple decides to proceed with the original plan. However, there are currently no signs that Apple has any immediate plans to do so.

The breakdown of the project may also be attributed to a potentially strained relationship between Apple and Goldman Sachs. The financial firm has reportedly been losing money from its management of Apple Card. Goldman Sachs helped launch the Apple Card in 2019 and spent approximately $350 per new customer acquisition. In 2022, it scaled back its efforts to transform its consumer savings business, Marcus, into a fully-fledged digital bank.

Executives of Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions stated in January 2022 that its consumer division may break even by 2025, a target initially set for the end of 2022.

This news might come as a relief for app-based stock trading services like Robin Hood and Cash App's investing services, which have a large contingent of iPhone users and offer programs for low-dollar investments in fractions of a share of stock.

Apple and Goldman Sachs declined CNBC's request for comment on the matter.

Sources told IANS that Apple Online Store has seen stupendous traffic for pre-orders, offering attractive schemes, trade-ins and more.

According to industry experts, Apple is riding on the “premiumisation” trend, where smartphone users in the country are looking to buy their third or fourth smartphone.

“iPhone being one of the most aspirational smartphones, coupled with big features upgrade for the iPhone 15 series, is attracting those increasingly ‘smartphone dependent’ users to upgrade to the best,“ Neil Shah, research vice president at Counterpoint Research, told IANS.

Further, easier access to financing and greater resale value is making premium iPhones more and more accessible to the mainstream users.

“With iPhone 15 base version now being made in India from the onset, if Apple decides to make the pricing of the new iPhones more attractive in coming months, it could have a blockbuster Diwali season,” Shah added.

Both the locally-manufactured iPhones will be available in India, at Apple Online and its own-branded retail stores (Apple BKC in Mumbai and Apple Saket in Delhi) on the global sales day on September 22.

iPhone maker Foxconn is assembling both iPhone 15 and 15 Plus at its Sriperumbudur plant in Tamil Nadu (NS: ).

Both the ‘Make in India’ iPhones will also be exported to other countries as well, which is also first for the country.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

The base iPhone 15 models will see a solid uptick in India as ""there is a significant upgrade for those shifting from previous iPhone 11, 12 and even 13-gen models,” according to industry experts.

Apple set a June quarter record in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones, according to its CEO Tim Cook.

""We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,"" the Apple CEO said last month.

In its report, GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, highlights that the wearable tech market has received significant attention and hype in the last decade, thanks to the popularity of devices such as Fitbit fitness bands and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watches.

“As the underlying technologies advance, wearables could potentially transform how we interact, monitor health and well-being, and consume digital content. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could usher in a new era of interactive and intelligent wearable devices, offering improved user experiences,” said Pinky Hiranandani, Senior Analyst, Thematic Intelligence team at GlobalData, in a statement.

The next generation of wearable tech will be designed for greater comfort, provide longer battery life, and feature immersive spatial audio, health monitoring, and AI-based communication.

“Enterprises will be a key market for wearable tech devices over the next three years, outpacing the consumer segment. Wearable tech devices are currently deployed across logistics, Defence, manufacturing, travel and tourism, and healthcare, primarily for training and remote support. Healthcare, particularly patient monitoring, remote training and support, and telehealth services, holds significant promise,” Hiranandani said.

Smart glasses and Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have been around for some time but have not become mainstream technology due to a dearth of compelling use cases, high prices, and privacy concerns.

“Companies that can find a niche and create compelling use will have the best chance of succeeding. Also, creating lightweight devices that can be used for longer and have practical use will help companies generate demand and revenue,” Hiranandani said.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Morgan Stanley identifies high-growth defensive stocks amid economic slowdown concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/morgan-stanley-identifies-highgrowth-defensive-stocks-amid-economic-slowdown-concerns-93CH-3815471,"Amid concerns of an economic slowdown and potential recession, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: )'s equity strategists have spotlighted a selection of defensive stocks expected to deliver robust growth and strong returns. These stocks, less volatile than the broader market, are seen as a shield against possible recessions and belong to sectors less exposed to cutbacks in consumer and business spending, such as groceries, small household products, healthcare insurance, pharmaceuticals, and utilities.

The Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation by reducing economic demand have prompted many Wall Street analysts to forecast a recession. Despite this outlook, economic demand has remained relatively stable so far, suggesting that growth could continue to slow with a recession potentially occurring next year.

In response to these conditions, Morgan Stanley's team conducted a screening of companies with the 1,000 largest market capitalizations for stocks demonstrating below-average volatility over the past 252 days. These had to be classified as ""growth stocks"" according to the bank's statistical model and hold Overweight ratings from relevant Morgan Stanley analysts. The list includes companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Boston Scientific (NYSE: ), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ), and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ).

UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: ) was also featured in the selection. Given that health insurance is deemed a necessity even in financially challenging times, it is expected to see annualized sales growth of around 8% over three years beyond 2022, reaching $463 billion in 2026. This projection is based on the company attracting nearly a million new Medicare advantage members annually. UnitedHealth Group's profit margins are also projected to rise slightly over the coming years due to a decrease in its medical-cost ratio after this year’s surge in elective procedures.

Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ) was another stock identified by Morgan Stanley’s screen. Despite consumers becoming more budget-conscious, sales are expected to grow annually at just over 4% to reach $21.9 billion in 2026 due to consumers' continued need for personal hygiene products. The company anticipates revenue growth from higher sales volumes, despite minor price increases in the near term, and expects costs to moderate in the future.

While these stocks are defensive in nature, they still offer significant upside potential. For instance, UnitedHealth Group's shares are trading at around 18.7 times earnings-per-share estimates for the next year, slightly above the S&P 500’s 18 times. Meanwhile, Colgate-Palmolive's stock trades at a somewhat pricey 21 times forward earnings, but it could maintain this valuation if a recession occurs and investors turn to consumer-staples stocks.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Robust demand for iPhone 15 Pro models despite inflation fears,https://in.investing.com/news/robust-demand-for-iphone-15-pro-models-despite-inflation-fears-93CH-3815416,"Despite rising inflation and interest rates, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s premium iPhone 15 models are witnessing strong demand, according to market analysts. This trend is indicated by extended shipping delays for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, as reported on Tuesday by Michael Ng, an analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).

Ng's research note on Monday highlighted that the pricier Pro models are experiencing longer shipping times compared to the more affordable base models of the smartphone. This suggests a supply-demand imbalance where demand is surpassing supply. However, Ng also cautioned about potential supply chain constraints, particularly for the Pro Max model. He maintains a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock with a price target of $216.

Apple's website confirms some of these delays. It shows that deliveries for certain colors of the iPhone 15 Pro Max are postponed until mid-November. However, Apple has not yet commented on this matter.

The success of the new iPhone is crucial for Apple's financial performance. In 2022, iPhone sales accounted for $205.5 billion out of Apple's total revenue of $394.3 billion. Therefore, any disappointment in sales could significantly impact the company's earnings.

On Friday, Amit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI, shared similar observations in his note. He pointed out data indicating strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, he also noted a slight dip in demand for the Pro/Plus models compared to last year. This could affect overall sales volumes but might be somewhat offset by higher prices for other models. Daryanani rates Apple as ""Outperform"" with a $210 price target.

Despite this robust demand and positive ratings from analysts, Apple's shares were down slightly by 0.2% on Tuesday to $177.59, even though they have risen by 37% this year.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Apple iPhone 15 launch sees major carriers offer hefty promotions,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-iphone-15-launch-sees-major-carriers-offer-hefty-promotions-93CH-3814674,"Major wireless carriers, including AT&T (NYSE: ), T-Mobile, and Verizon (NYSE: ), are accepting pre-orders ahead of the Friday launch of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15. According to MoffettNathanson analysts, these companies are offering substantial promotions for customers, with variations based on the provider and the customer's status - whether they are new or premium rate plan subscribers.

Craig Moffett, founder of MoffettNathanson, noted that this year's iPhone promotions are the most generous to date. The top three carriers are offering free iPhone 15 Pro devices or discounts up to $1,000. However, Moffett also indicated that these aggressive promotions do not significantly differ from those offered last year.

Data from mobile phone price data firm Navi supports Moffett's claim. The average promotional values this year are similar to those of the previous year. However, AT&T has increased its promotional values for both new and existing customers upgrading their devices compared to last year. In contrast, while Verizon has increased promotional values for those switching to their service, they have decreased benefits for existing customers upgrading their devices.

T-Mobile's promotional values for customers switching or upgrading their services are 9% lower than last year. This reduction suggests T-Mobile's confidence in gaining customers without excessive giveaways. On the other hand, AT&T is offering 8% higher promotions for similar customers, indicating a different strategy.

Despite these aggressive promotions from the big three carriers, cable companies with wireless operations such as Charter and Comcast (NASDAQ: )'s Xfinity Mobile are also offering deals. These deals are less attractive than those offered by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, Moffett suggests that these cable companies may still attract some customers away from the big three carriers.

MoffettNathanson holds Market Perform ratings for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile with price targets set at $17, $40, and $172 respectively. On Monday, AT&T stock fell by 1% to $15.08, while Verizon and T-Mobile shares fell by 0.8% to $33.53 and $140.81 respectively. Meanwhile, Charter and Comcast are rated as Outperform with a $665 and $47 price target respectively.

Despite the high level of promotions in the wireless industry and the gradual decrease in industry unit growth rate, Moffett expressed that this year's promotions do not alleviate these concerns but do not exacerbate them either.

Meanwhile, Citi Research analysts do not anticipate these promotions to significantly impact the traditional iPhone launch season or recent market trends. Apple's stock increased by 1.7% to $177.97 on Monday.

This decision follows reports that the first prototypes of Apple's 5G modem were not only slow but also prone to overheating, making them significantly inferior to Qualcomm's current versions.

The extended agreement with Qualcomm will cover smartphone launches in 2024, 2025, and 2026, according to a statement by Qualcomm. The companies' previous agreement was set to expire this year, and the upcoming iPhone was expected to be one of the last relying on Qualcomm modems.

A Wall Street Journal report revealed that Apple's in-house 5G modems are estimated to be three years behind Qualcomm. The report also highlighted issues such as poor communication between managers and lofty ambitions as factors contributing to the project's delay.

The development of the in-house modem began in 2018 under the leadership of former wireless director Jaydeep Ranade. Despite Apple's unmatched prowess in the custom silicon segment, it faced difficulties in developing a modem that complied with strict connectivity regulations worldwide and was compatible with different wireless carriers.

Apple had initially planned to debut its custom-built 5G modem in iPhones starting in 2025. However, given the performance and efficiency challenges faced by the prototypes, there is a chance that the company might postpone the official launch again.

Previous reports had suggested Apple would debut its custom-built 5G modem as early as 2022. However, these expectations seem to have been dashed as unnamed Apple executives acknowledged that their first custom 5G chips were far behind Qualcomm's leading Snapdragon X75 modem.

It is now uncertain whether Apple will unveil its first in-house 5G modem during the iPhone 16 announcement next year. Despite acquiring Intel (NASDAQ: )'s smartphone modem business in July 2019 and adding 2,200 Intel engineers to its chipset operations globally, Apple's ambitious project seems to be facing significant hurdles.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Apple's AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case now available at a discount,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-airpods-pro-with-usbc-charging-case-now-available-at-a-discount-93CH-3818782,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s latest addition to its audio product line, the new AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case, has been released and is already on sale just over a week after its launch. This new model is being offered at a 20% discount, priced at $200 on Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The transition to a USB-C charging case for the AirPods Pro aligns with Apple's recent shift to USB-C on the iPhone 15. The change was anticipated well ahead of its release due to various leaks. This modification aims to reduce cable clutter and even allows for the earbuds to be charged directly from an iPhone 15.

The new AirPods Pro model carries over the H2 chip from the Vision Pro headset, which will support low-latency lossless audio when the device launches next year. However, this has sparked some controversy as previous AirPods Pro models with a Lightning charging case will not be compatible with Vision Pro.

The new model also boasts improved weatherproofing, with the rating upgraded from IPX4 to IP54, providing dust protection. Despite these enhancements, they are largely similar to the previous 2nd-generation version in terms of features. They offer superior audio quality and active noise cancellation performance compared to the first-gen AirPods Pro.

In addition to these changes, Apple has retained user-favorite features such as hands-free access to Siri, seamless switching between iCloud-connected devices, and added volume control.

The second generation of AirPods Pro was released in 2022 and received a product refresh in 2022. The newer model is not only equipped with a USB-C charging case but is also dust resistant, enhancing the earbuds' already water-resistant design.

Despite these improvements, if consumers already own the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro, it may not be worth upgrading to the latest model. However, for those in the market for a new pair, the current discount offers a great deal for such a recently launched product.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Apple’s iPhone 15 Pro Max Sales Outperform Expectations Despite Economic Headwinds,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-iphone-15-pro-max-sales-outperform-expectations-despite-economic-headwinds-93CH-3818633,"In the face of economic instability marked by high inflation and interest rates, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s latest iPhone release, particularly the iPhone 15 Pro Max, is performing better than anticipated, according to market analysts. This comes as a positive surprise, suggesting that smartphones are less of a discretionary purchase than previously assumed.

Analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Wedbush reported a robust start to the sales cycle of the new iPhone model based on pre-order data. The high-end iPhone 15 Pro Max has been particularly successful. A Credit Suisse (SIX: ) analyst also noted extended lead times for orders of this model, indicating strong demand.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: )' analyst Michael Ng echoed this positive sentiment, stating that while there isn't much visibility into iPhone supply, it is evident that demand is surpassing supply. Ng set a 12-month price target for Apple stock at $216. Other analysts from Morgan Stanley, Wedbush, and Credit Suisse have set their targets at $215, $240, and $220 respectively.

Given that iPhones constitute over half of Apple's revenue, such a surge in demand for the latest models—especially the more expensive ones—provides encouraging news for investors.

However, not all analysts align with this optimistic trend. Barclays (LON: ) analyst Tim Long suggested potential challenges for iPhone 15 sales in China based on his examination of pre-orders. He noted a slight preference for lower-priced models compared to last year's mix and set a 12-month price target for Apple stock at $167.

Apple's Greater China segment represents about 19% of its fiscal 2022 sales. Therefore, any difficulties in this major market could impact Apple's stock performance. However, Long's analysis also reveals a silver lining: he estimates only a 5% year-over-year decrease in overall unit orders in the Chinese market. Given recent media consensus that China's recovery is stalling, this minor decline suggests that potential iPhone sales drops in China may not significantly hinder overall performance, particularly considering potential strength in North America and other markets.

In conclusion, despite the uncertain economic climate, demand for Apple's new iPhone models appears to be outpacing supply—an encouraging sign for investors.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Apple 'spectacularly' failed to develop its own silicon chip - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-spectacularly-failed-to-develop-its-own-silicon-chip--wsj-432SI-3818433,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) has failed in developing its own silicon chip that would allow it to cut its partnership with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), a report in the WSJ noted.

The new iPhone models launched recently lack a proprietary silicon chip that Apple had invested significant time and resources in developing.

This initiative, initiated by Apple's CEO Tim Cook in 2018, aimed to design and produce a modem chip, responsible for connecting iPhones to wireless carriers, with the objective of reducing Apple's dependence on Qualcomm, a dominant chip supplier in the modem market.

However, the challenges faced in completing this chip project were primarily due to Apple's own decisions, the WSJ report notes citing former company engineers and executives familiar with the project.

The chip was initially intended to be included in the new iPhone models, but testing in late 2022 revealed issues such as slow performance and overheating. Moreover, the chip's physical size was so large that it would occupy half of an iPhone's space, rendering it impractical for use.

Investors had anticipated cost savings from an in-house chip, especially in the face of sluggish demand in the broader smartphone market. Nonetheless, Apple is estimated to have paid Qualcomm over $7.2 billion for chips in the previous year.

Engineering teams working on Apple's modem chip faced various challenges, including technical hurdles, poor communication, and managerial disagreements over whether to design the chips internally or procure them externally.

“Just because Apple builds the best silicon on the planet, it’s ridiculous to think that they could also build a modem,” the former Apple wireless director Jaydeep Ranade, told WSJ.

Apple executives gained a clearer understanding of the project's challenges when the company tested its modem chip prototypes in late 2022. The results of these tests were far from satisfactory, according to WSJ, as the tested chips were found to be lagging behind Qualcomm's top-performing modem chip by approximately three years in terms of technological advancement and capabilities.

Earlier this month, Qualcomm announced it will continue to supply Apple with iPhone 5G modems until 2026."

With this spyware, “the US had obtained control over tens of thousands of devices and stolen a substantial amount of high-value data,"" the ministry said in the post.

Amid the escalating rivalry between the US and China, earlier this month, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan revealed that the Joe Biden government seeks to know more about the new, ‘made in China’ Huawei chipset used in the Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

Later, the Xi Jinping government reportedly barred officials from using Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones at work. The government later took a U-turn, saying it allows all foreign devices, including Apple, to continue to be used by people in the country.

The feature would have allowed users to buy and sell stocks directly from their iPhones, potentially rivaling existing trading apps such as Robinhood (NASDAQ: ) and Cash App. However, the reasons behind the decision to shelve the project remain unclear.

The project reportedly began in 2020 during a period of historically low-interest rates and record interest in share trading, fueled by the meme stock bonanza. The initial rollout was scheduled for 2022. However, as market conditions worsened last year, Apple and Goldman Sachs decided to put the project on hold due to concerns over potential backlash if users lost money in the stock market. Instead, efforts were redirected towards Apple Savings, which offers high yields for users compared to traditional savings accounts.

Sources familiar with the matter revealed that the infrastructure for the project is ""mostly built"" and could be launched if Apple decides to proceed with the original plan. However, there are currently no signs that Apple has any immediate plans to do so.

The breakdown of the project may also be attributed to a potentially strained relationship between Apple and Goldman Sachs. The financial firm has reportedly been losing money from its management of Apple Card. Goldman Sachs helped launch the Apple Card in 2019 and spent approximately $350 per new customer acquisition. In 2022, it scaled back its efforts to transform its consumer savings business, Marcus, into a fully-fledged digital bank.

Executives of Goldman Sachs' Platform Solutions stated in January 2022 that its consumer division may break even by 2025, a target initially set for the end of 2022.

This news might come as a relief for app-based stock trading services like Robin Hood and Cash App's investing services, which have a large contingent of iPhone users and offer programs for low-dollar investments in fractions of a share of stock.

Apple and Goldman Sachs declined CNBC's request for comment on the matter.

2022-09-20, IANS,Global wearable tech market to surpass $290 bn in 2030: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/global-wearable-tech-market-to-surpass-290-bn-in-2030-report-3816039,"New Delhi, Sep 20 (IANS) The wearable tech industry is set to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 14.3 per cent from $99.5 billion in 2022 to $290.6 billion in 2030.In an era defined by innovation and connectivity, wearable technology has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionising the way we live, work, and play, said a report by GlobalData on Wednesday.

In its report, GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, highlights that the wearable tech market has received significant attention and hype in the last decade, thanks to the popularity of devices such as Fitbit fitness bands and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watches.

“As the underlying technologies advance, wearables could potentially transform how we interact, monitor health and well-being, and consume digital content. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could usher in a new era of interactive and intelligent wearable devices, offering improved user experiences,” said Pinky Hiranandani, Senior Analyst, Thematic Intelligence team at GlobalData, in a statement.

The next generation of wearable tech will be designed for greater comfort, provide longer battery life, and feature immersive spatial audio, health monitoring, and AI-based communication.

“Enterprises will be a key market for wearable tech devices over the next three years, outpacing the consumer segment. Wearable tech devices are currently deployed across logistics, Defence, manufacturing, travel and tourism, and healthcare, primarily for training and remote support. Healthcare, particularly patient monitoring, remote training and support, and telehealth services, holds significant promise,” Hiranandani said.

Smart glasses and Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have been around for some time but have not become mainstream technology due to a dearth of compelling use cases, high prices, and privacy concerns.

“Companies that can find a niche and create compelling use will have the best chance of succeeding. Also, creating lightweight devices that can be used for longer and have practical use will help companies generate demand and revenue,” Hiranandani said.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Morgan Stanley identifies high-growth defensive stocks amid economic slowdown concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/morgan-stanley-identifies-highgrowth-defensive-stocks-amid-economic-slowdown-concerns-93CH-3815471,"Amid concerns of an economic slowdown and potential recession, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: )'s equity strategists have spotlighted a selection of defensive stocks expected to deliver robust growth and strong returns. These stocks, less volatile than the broader market, are seen as a shield against possible recessions and belong to sectors less exposed to cutbacks in consumer and business spending, such as groceries, small household products, healthcare insurance, pharmaceuticals, and utilities.

The Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation by reducing economic demand have prompted many Wall Street analysts to forecast a recession. Despite this outlook, economic demand has remained relatively stable so far, suggesting that growth could continue to slow with a recession potentially occurring next year.

In response to these conditions, Morgan Stanley's team conducted a screening of companies with the 1,000 largest market capitalizations for stocks demonstrating below-average volatility over the past 252 days. These had to be classified as ""growth stocks"" according to the bank's statistical model and hold Overweight ratings from relevant Morgan Stanley analysts. The list includes companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Boston Scientific (NYSE: ), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: ), and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ).

UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: ) was also featured in the selection. Given that health insurance is deemed a necessity even in financially challenging times, it is expected to see annualized sales growth of around 8% over three years beyond 2022, reaching $463 billion in 2026. This projection is based on the company attracting nearly a million new Medicare advantage members annually. UnitedHealth Group's profit margins are also projected to rise slightly over the coming years due to a decrease in its medical-cost ratio after this year’s surge in elective procedures.

Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ) was another stock identified by Morgan Stanley’s screen. Despite consumers becoming more budget-conscious, sales are expected to grow annually at just over 4% to reach $21.9 billion in 2026 due to consumers' continued need for personal hygiene products. The company anticipates revenue growth from higher sales volumes, despite minor price increases in the near term, and expects costs to moderate in the future.

While these stocks are defensive in nature, they still offer significant upside potential. For instance, UnitedHealth Group's shares are trading at around 18.7 times earnings-per-share estimates for the next year, slightly above the S&P 500’s 18 times. Meanwhile, Colgate-Palmolive's stock trades at a somewhat pricey 21 times forward earnings, but it could maintain this valuation if a recession occurs and investors turn to consumer-staples stocks.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Robust demand for iPhone 15 Pro models despite inflation fears,https://in.investing.com/news/robust-demand-for-iphone-15-pro-models-despite-inflation-fears-93CH-3815416,"Despite rising inflation and interest rates, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s premium iPhone 15 models are witnessing strong demand, according to market analysts. This trend is indicated by extended shipping delays for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, as reported on Tuesday by Michael Ng, an analyst at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).

Ng's research note on Monday highlighted that the pricier Pro models are experiencing longer shipping times compared to the more affordable base models of the smartphone. This suggests a supply-demand imbalance where demand is surpassing supply. However, Ng also cautioned about potential supply chain constraints, particularly for the Pro Max model. He maintains a ""Buy"" rating on Apple's stock with a price target of $216.

Apple's website confirms some of these delays. It shows that deliveries for certain colors of the iPhone 15 Pro Max are postponed until mid-November. However, Apple has not yet commented on this matter.

The success of the new iPhone is crucial for Apple's financial performance. In 2022, iPhone sales accounted for $205.5 billion out of Apple's total revenue of $394.3 billion. Therefore, any disappointment in sales could significantly impact the company's earnings.

On Friday, Amit Daryanani, an analyst at Evercore ISI, shared similar observations in his note. He pointed out data indicating strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, he also noted a slight dip in demand for the Pro/Plus models compared to last year. This could affect overall sales volumes but might be somewhat offset by higher prices for other models. Daryanani rates Apple as ""Outperform"" with a $210 price target.

Despite this robust demand and positive ratings from analysts, Apple's shares were down slightly by 0.2% on Tuesday to $177.59, even though they have risen by 37% this year.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Apple iPhone 15 launch sees major carriers offer hefty promotions,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-iphone-15-launch-sees-major-carriers-offer-hefty-promotions-93CH-3814674,"Major wireless carriers, including AT&T (NYSE: ), T-Mobile, and Verizon (NYSE: ), are accepting pre-orders ahead of the Friday launch of Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iPhone 15. According to MoffettNathanson analysts, these companies are offering substantial promotions for customers, with variations based on the provider and the customer's status - whether they are new or premium rate plan subscribers.

Craig Moffett, founder of MoffettNathanson, noted that this year's iPhone promotions are the most generous to date. The top three carriers are offering free iPhone 15 Pro devices or discounts up to $1,000. However, Moffett also indicated that these aggressive promotions do not significantly differ from those offered last year.

Data from mobile phone price data firm Navi supports Moffett's claim. The average promotional values this year are similar to those of the previous year. However, AT&T has increased its promotional values for both new and existing customers upgrading their devices compared to last year. In contrast, while Verizon has increased promotional values for those switching to their service, they have decreased benefits for existing customers upgrading their devices.

T-Mobile's promotional values for customers switching or upgrading their services are 9% lower than last year. This reduction suggests T-Mobile's confidence in gaining customers without excessive giveaways. On the other hand, AT&T is offering 8% higher promotions for similar customers, indicating a different strategy.

Despite these aggressive promotions from the big three carriers, cable companies with wireless operations such as Charter and Comcast (NASDAQ: )'s Xfinity Mobile are also offering deals. These deals are less attractive than those offered by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. However, Moffett suggests that these cable companies may still attract some customers away from the big three carriers.

MoffettNathanson holds Market Perform ratings for AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile with price targets set at $17, $40, and $172 respectively. On Monday, AT&T stock fell by 1% to $15.08, while Verizon and T-Mobile shares fell by 0.8% to $33.53 and $140.81 respectively. Meanwhile, Charter and Comcast are rated as Outperform with a $665 and $47 price target respectively.

Despite the high level of promotions in the wireless industry and the gradual decrease in industry unit growth rate, Moffett expressed that this year's promotions do not alleviate these concerns but do not exacerbate them either.

Meanwhile, Citi Research analysts do not anticipate these promotions to significantly impact the traditional iPhone launch season or recent market trends. Apple's stock increased by 1.7% to $177.97 on Monday.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,"China's economic recovery impact on S&P 500 limited, investors remain cautious",https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-economic-recovery-impact-on-sp-500-limited-investors-remain-cautious-93CH-3814598,"The ongoing economic recovery in China may not significantly impact the , despite its sluggish pace. This was reported on Monday, suggesting that Chinese operations contribute to merely 5% of the total revenue of companies listed in the S&P 500, according to Scott Chronert from Citi.

Chronert further pointed out that a total loss of revenue from China would result in about a 7% decrease in the S&P 500 earnings, a substantial but not disastrous scenario. A 5% reduction in revenue from China would lead to a slight 0.3% decline in earnings-per-share (EPS) for the index. If half of all revenue from China were eliminated, the S&P 500 EPS would drop by approximately 3.4%.

However, investors are advised to stay vigilant as a slowdown in China could potentially cause future problems. This is particularly relevant for companies with significant weightings in the index, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). These seven major companies earn more than 10% of their revenue from China. Therefore, while the overall risk to the index is relatively minor, there might be pockets of risk and volatility if there's a significant slowdown in China.

Certain industries like tech, autos, household products, and pharma have a higher-than-average exposure to China which could lead to an unstable profit outlook. Furthermore, some U.S. businesses are at an even greater risk as they derive over 30% of their revenue from China. These include Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: ), Aptiv (NYSE: ), Estée Lauder, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ: )., Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ).

Despite recent positive news about Chinese retail sales and industrial production, investors remain cautious. In August alone, foreign investors withdrew nearly $15 billion from Chinese stocks. While U.S. stocks have so far avoided the volatility experienced by offshore Chinese counterparts this year due to hopes of economic recovery, companies with substantial China exposure may continue to be viewed as less attractive by some investors.

This move comes as the strikes approach day 140, with negotiations between the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) set to resume later this week.

The suspension affects several studios including Feigco Entertainment, The Tannenbaum Co., Timberman/Beverly Productions, Groundswell Productions, and ""Power"" Universe star Joseph Sikora. Despite the suspension, Lionsgate plans to continue paying assistants and development executives under the suspended deals until October 1, with potential extensions if deemed necessary.

This decision by Lionsgate follows similar actions taken by other studios such as Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. TV, and CBS Studios over the past few weeks. These suspensions predominantly impact non-writing executive producers.

Disney and CBS Studios have pledged to continue paying salaries for impacted assistants through the end of 2022. Development executives at Disney will also receive their salaries through the first week of October.

The first wave of suspensions began in early May, primarily affecting writers just days into the WGA strike. The industry has seen more rolling suspensions over the past couple of months as more producers concluded work on shows amidst an industry-wide production shutdown.

As the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue into the fall, there is a glimmer of hope as negotiations between WGA and AMPTP are set to resume this Wednesday.

Apple leads big tech higher as Wall Street debates iPhone 15 demand

Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 2% as some Wall Street cheered signs of stronger demand for the tech giant’s newly launched iPhone 15, particularly for the higher-priced iPhone Pro and Pro Max models, compared with initial demand for the iPhone 14.

“iPhone 15 pre-orders began this Friday and so far (as of Sunday pm) are tracking much stronger than we and the Street expected and up roughly 10%-12% from iPhone 14 based on our analysis,” Wedbush said in a recent note.

But not everyone on Wall Street is waxing lyrically about the strength of the iPhone 15 launch. Barclays said that early pre-order data pointed to a difficult iPhone 15 cycle in China, with demand trending toward the lower-priced iPhone 15.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Apple’s Vision Pro Headset to Support Lossless Audio, iPhone and iPad Still Waiting",https://in.investing.com/news/apples-vision-pro-headset-to-support-lossless-audio-iphone-and-ipad-still-waiting-93CH-3814044,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s recently announced Vision Pro headset will be the first device to support lossless audio, a feature that is yet to be introduced on the iPhone 15, iPad, or Apple TV 4K, according to information released on Monday. This decision has sparked discussions among tech enthusiasts who believe the cutting-edge technology should have been implemented across more widely used devices like the iPhone or iPad.

Lossless audio, which refers to audio files that have not been compressed in any way, offers superior sound quality. However, achieving lossless audio playback requires a wired connection between a computer or laptop and headphones or a wireless speaker connected via Wi-Fi to a phone or tablet.

The Vision Pro headset, a premium product priced at $3,499, uses a new unnamed wireless protocol developed by Apple. This protocol employs Apple's H2 Wireless Chip found in both the AirPods Pro 2 and the Vision Pro along with new software reserved for the Vision Pro's launch. Unfortunately, this software or some other undisclosed feature appears to be missing from devices like the iPhone 15, iPad, and Apple TV 4K, meaning they won't support lossless audio.

The exclusion of lossless audio from these devices is seen as a missed opportunity given their popularity and widespread usage. However, there is an expectation that Apple will eventually extend this technology to its iPhones and iPads. It is suggested that within the next 12 months, Apple may announce additional products supporting lossless audio.

In addition to the Vision Pro announcement, Apple has also launched an upgraded version of its second-generation AirPods Pro. The new model includes improved dust resistance and a USB-C charging port instead of Apple's 'Lightning' port. While sound quality remains similar to its predecessor, the new AirPods Pro 2 can now be charged directly from an iPhone, a feature not previously available.

The new AirPods Pro 2 also supports lossless audio specifically designed for Apple's Vision Pro headset, which is set to be available in early 2024. Other features of the iOS 17 update for iPhones, which will also apply to all AirPods Pro, include 'adaptive audio' and 'conversational awareness'.

Despite the disappointment over the limited availability of lossless audio support, the future of this technology remains promising as Apple continues to innovate in the realm of audio quality and user experience.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,PayPal Braces for Leadership Change Amidst Challenges and Stagnant Growth,https://in.investing.com/news/paypal-braces-for-leadership-change-amidst-challenges-and-stagnant-growth-93CH-3813875,"Monday, September 18, 2022 - PayPal (NASDAQ: ) is preparing for a significant transition as Alex Chriss is set to assume the role of chief executive on September 27, succeeding current CEO Dan Schulman. Schulman, however, will continue to serve on PayPal's board until May 2024.

The leadership change comes during a challenging period for the fintech giant. Over the past two years, PayPal's shares have plummeted by over 75%, attributable to diminishing investor interest in fintech companies, escalating competition from Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and a slowdown in its branded checkout business growth.

Chriss, an experienced executive hailing from Intuit (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is perceived as a potential catalyst for PayPal's recovery. However, Wall Street analysts caution that the company's turnaround could be a protracted process.

Lisa Ellis, an analyst from MoffettNathanson, recently downgraded PayPal's shares from Outperform to Market Perform and reduced her price target on the shares from $85 to $75. Ellis attributed this downgrade to Apple's growing dominance in the payments sector and its implications for PayPal. She also pointed out that PayPal's gross profit growth has stagnated over the years, transitioning from double digits between 2018 and 2021 to low- to mid-single digits currently.

Ellis further emphasized that Chriss faces a formidable task of filling key roles within the company. PayPal currently has several positions either vacant or filled on an interim basis, including chief operating officer, chief financial officer, treasurer, and chief strategy officer. Amidst the company's ongoing struggles, attracting top-tier talent could be a significant challenge.

Despite these hurdles, the upcoming leadership change presents an opportunity for PayPal to recalibrate its strategic direction. However, analysts suggest that substantial changes might require time.

The tech giant has seen a surge in preorders for its latest smartphone, which are up by 10% to 12% compared to the same period for its predecessor, the iPhone 14, as per an analysis by Wedbush on Monday.

Wedbush's Daniel Ives expressed increased confidence in the new iPhone's success based on recent supply-chain checks in Asia. The checks suggest that Apple could sell approximately 85 million units initially, with the possibility of nearing 90 million due to compelling carrier promotions anticipated throughout the holiday season.

Apple's shares have been under some pressure recently, trading at $174.69 in premarket trading on Monday, marking a slight decrease of 0.2%. This follows a drift from highs of around $195 in late July 2022, a decline partly attributed to concerns over a potential ban on iPhone usage by Chinese government officials.

Further positive news for Apple comes from the distribution of these preorders. Ives noted a noticeable lean towards the more expensive Pro and Pro Max models of the iPhone 15. As a result, Wedbush predicts that Apple could see an average selling price of approximately $925 for their latest smartphone, marking an increase of around $100 compared to sales over the past year to 15 months.

Public data also supports this trend towards higher-end models. Delivery dates for the iPhone 15 Pro Max have been pushed back until November in several countries, including the U.S., indicating strong demand.

Despite caution regarding Apple's short-term setup from Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein, he also advised against underestimating the potential impact of these promising iPhone 15 data points.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Imagination Technologies plans New York IPO amid global chip industry boom,https://in.investing.com/news/imagination-technologies-plans-new-york-ipo-amid-global-chip-industry-boom-93CH-3813745,"Imagination Technologies, a U.K.-based semiconductor firm, is reportedly planning to go public in New York, marking a significant return to public markets since it was delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2017. The move comes on the heels of the successful initial public offering (IPO) of Arm, another chip designer, which achieved a valuation of $54 billion, becoming the largest IPO of the year.

Imagination's business model, similar to Arm's, involves licensing its semiconductor intellectual property to other companies. The company was taken private in 2017 by Canyon Bridge, an investment group backed by China, in a deal worth $742 million.

The news of Imagination's potential IPO follows a surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence (AI), which has boosted shares in chip companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and added momentum to Arm's IPO. Wall Street expects that Arm's successful listing could invigorate capital markets and pave the way for more companies to go public.

Imagination's client roster includes tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its primary focus is on designing chips for various applications, including self-driving cars and cloud computing. A key product offering is neural network accelerators that power AI. Thus, if it goes public, Imagination could offer investors a more direct opportunity to invest in AI.

According to filings made last week, Imagination reported annual revenue of £120 million ($149 million) for 2022, up from £111 million in 2021. The company has identified the automotive sector as one of its more resilient target markets compared to the overall semiconductor market.

2022-09-18, IANS,iOS 17 arrives with new features across Apple’s first-party apps,https://in.investing.com/news/ios-17-arrives-with-new-features-across-apples-firstparty-apps-3813616,"New Delhi, Sep 18 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) iOS 17 was all set to be officially available globally, including in India, on Monday as a free software update for newly-launched iPhone 15 series, including the older models, with a slew of improved security features.The iOS 17 offers new features across Apple’s first-party apps, including the Phone app, Messages, FaceTime, and more, and introduces new functionality like Live Voicemail, FaceTime audio and video messages.

“We’ve also reimagined AirDrop with new ways to share, autocorrect gets even better, and we’re introducing all-new experiences with Journal and StandBy,” according to Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering.

The Phone app gets major updates, with Contact Posters that allow users to customise how they appear to their contacts, and Live Voicemail, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message.

Messages gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and Check In, which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely, according to Apple.

NameDrop gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together.

The same gesture can be used to AirDrop content and more, and now users can step away from each other and finish sending large files over the internet.

StandBy gives users a customisable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. With the Always-On display of iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, StandBy stays on to show useful information -- perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter.

Interactive widgets on the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and in StandBy allow users to take action with just a tap, making it easy to complete a to-do, or play or pause a song right from the widget.

Safari adds greater protection for Private Browsing and introduces profiles, helping users separate their browsing for topics like work and personal.

iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal, a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more.

A key addition to Lockdown Mode is that it now runs on Apple Watch, not just iPhones, iPads and Macs. Lockdown Mode in iOS 17 also automatically removes the geolocation data from photos by default when sharing photos with other people.

Private browsing will also lock by default, prompting the device owner to scan their face or fingerprint before their private tabs will open.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Apple stock pops as analysts say iPhone 15 demand is outpacing supply,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-stock-pops-as-analysts-say-iphone-15-demand-is-outpacing-supply-432SI-3813411,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares rose modestly in pre-open Monday after several Wall Street analysts weighed in on the lead times for iPhone 15.

Analysts are expressing optimism regarding the tech giant's pre-orders for the latest iPhone 15, saying that demand is surpassing expectations. Accordingly, delivery times for the iPhone 15 Pro have extended into November for certain configurations, indicating strong demand.

According to Morgan Stanley, the early data indicates a solid start to the cycle with the iPhone 15 Pro Max experiencing the longest lead times of any model launched in the past seven years. China data points are also exceeding expectations.

Goldman Sachs analysts flag the extended lead times for high-end models.

“We view the extended lead times for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max as a positive indication of consumer demand and for increasing price/mix, but recognize that there is little transparency into supply, which could be impacted by potential supply chain constraints, particularly in the Pro Max,” they said in a client note.

“Separately, we're encouraged by US carrier promotions available for the iPhone 15 family of devices, which appear largely consistent with year-ago and provide opportunities for consumers to cover the full purchase price of a new phone with an eligible trade-in; that said, the most attractive promotions require consumers to have - or upgrade to - some of the carrier's newer, more expensive plans,” the analysts added.

Wedbush analysts described carrier promotions as “eye-popping”, serving as “a major catalyst for upgrades this holiday season.”

“We believe iPhone units should level out in the 225 million unit range in FY24 and a rising ASP lift which is being underestimated by the Street as Cupertino has a massive pent-up installed base upgrade cycle now underway. This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that ~250 million+ of 1.2 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 4 years,” they wrote."

""Fully committed to support and facilitate,"" Vaishnaw said on X in response to Foxconn India representative V Lee's LinkedIn post to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 73rd birthday in which he said the company was “aiming for another doubling of employment, FDI (foreign direct investment), and business size in India” by this time next year.

Foxconn is the main assembler of Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones and both companies are keen to move away from China and create alternative supply chains.

The Communist giant stands alienated due to its military muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and dubious role in the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic that destroyed lives and livelihoods across the world.

Foxconn already has an iPhone factory in Tamil Nadu (NS: ), which employs 40,000 people and has signed an agreement to invest Rs 1,600 crore in a new electronics components unit in the state that will create 6,000 jobs.

The company has also announced that it will be investing an additional Rs 3,300 crore in its manufacturing facility in Telangana. This will take the total investment of the company in the state to more than Rs 4,550 crore.

The upcoming unit, being set up by Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd (FIT), will manufacture Apple accessories and is located at Kongara Kalan on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

Besides, the company had also announced in August that it would invest Rs.5,000 crore ($600 million) in Karnataka for two projects in the state to make casing components for iPhones and for chip-making equipment.

Foxconn chairman Young Liu had visited India recently to attend the SemiconIndia 2022 event hosted for global semiconductor companies that was inaugurated by Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar recently.

Speaking at the event, the Foxconn chairman said, ""I can feel the determination of the Indian government. I am very optimistic about where it's headed.""

He highlighted the Buffalo Spirit of the Taiwan semiconductor industry, which is the ability to work hard without complaining and said that the same spirit could be applied to India.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway shows strong faith in Apple and itself,https://in.investing.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-shows-strong-faith-in-apple-and-itself-93CH-3813282,"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), led by CEO Warren Buffett, has shown significant interest in tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its own company shares, according to the latest 13F filings and comments from the annual shareholder meeting. As of Monday this week, Apple reportedly accounted for 45.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's $354 billion investment portfolio, making it the clear top investment.

According to Buffett, there are four primary reasons why Apple is highly valued by his firm. First, Apple's brand recognition and customer loyalty are seen as key assets. Second, the company's innovative nature and consistent updates to its products are appreciated by Buffett and his team. Third, Buffett expresses complete trust in Apple's management team and its shift towards a platform business model with more emphasis on subscription services. Finally, Buffett appreciates Apple's substantial capital-return program, which includes one of the largest nominal-dollar dividend payouts among public companies and a stock repurchase program that has bought back approximately $600 billion worth of its common stock since 2013.

However, another stock that has caught the eye of Warren Buffett is none other than Berkshire Hathaway itself. A change in policy on July 17, 2018, allowed Buffett and executive vice chairman Charlie Munger more freedom to buy back their company's stock as long as they maintain at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on their balance sheet. Since this policy change, Berkshire Hathaway has consistently bought back its own shares for 20 consecutive quarters, totaling over $71 billion. This buyback program is viewed as a way to reward long-term investors by incrementally increasing their ownership stakes.

Furthermore, the buyback program has had a positive impact on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings per share (EPS), which should rise as the outstanding share count declines for businesses with steady or growing net income.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Leading U.S. banks set to launch 'Paze', a mobile wallet in response to tech giants",https://in.investing.com/news/leading-us-banks-set-to-launch-paze-a-mobile-wallet-in-response-to-tech-giants-93CH-3813153,"In the latest development in the ongoing competition between traditional banking institutions and tech giants, major American banks are preparing to introduce a mobile wallet, Paze, which will connect directly with the credit and debit card accounts of 150 million customers. The app, scheduled for launch next year, is a collective effort by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), and others. Early Warning Services, which operates the payment app Zelle, will manage Paze.

This move marks a significant shift in strategy for these banking giants. Previously, they believed they could individually compete against Big Tech and emerging fintech startups. However, the rise of tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the financial services sector has led these banks to reconsider their approach.

Over recent years, JPMorgan Chase has partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple to expand their banking services. In a similar vein, Citi has inked a deal to finance Amazon's installment payment offering. This trend is not just confined to the United States. In Europe, Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) is exploring partnerships with fintech companies, while Orange's banking division in France has made deals with fintechs Younited and Mambu for digital lending and online banking platforms respectively.

Nevertheless, these collaborations have not been without regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential risks these partnerships could pose to banks and the wider U.S. banking system.

The mobile wallet market has become a key area of competition between banks and tech companies. Banks have traditionally dominated consumer payments but the rise of Apple Pay has challenged this dominance. While Apple does not disclose official usage statistics for its mobile wallet, it is reported that over 500 million users have adopted Apple Pay in just five years.

In hopes of emulating their success with Zelle - which since its 2017 launch has become the largest peer-to-peer payment app with transactions totaling $629 billion last year - banks are launching Paze. Yet, the handling of fraud cases involving Zelle has drawn criticism towards these banks.

The success of Paze will largely rely on banks' willingness to allow it to connect directly to customers' bank accounts, giving it a potential advantage over Apple Pay. The Paze team recently recruited Cameron Fowler, a top executive from BMO Financial Group, as its next CEO. However, details about Paze's functionality and whether users will be able to access their account information through the app remain limited.

With tech companies continuing to expand their financial services offerings and banks striving to maintain their market share, the future of the financial services industry remains uncertain.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""

""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.

For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:

""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL?

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

2022-09-18, IANS,Tim Cook says 'there are some things he doesn't like about Elon Musk's X',https://in.investing.com/news/tim-cook-says-there-are-some-things-he-doesnt-like-about-elon-musks-x-3813034,"San Francisco, Sep 18 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook has said that there are ""some things about"" Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter) that he doesn't like.Cook called the platform's apparent anti-semitism problem ""abhorrent"" in an interview with CBS, but added, ""Twitter is an important property; I like the concept that it's there for discourse"".

However, when asked whether Apple should be advertising on X, he said that this is something the company ""constantly"" asks itself.

Further, the Apple CEO was asked about the release date of the Vision Pro as according to reports, the headset is facing manufacturing delays, on which Cook confirmed that the Vision Pro is still on schedule, restating his statements from last week's iPhone 15 ""Wonderlust"" event.

When Cook was asked whether the challenges he faced in creating the iPhone were the same with the Vision Pro, he said it was ""more complex"".

""No, it's more complex, and so it requires innovation in not only the development, but also in the manufacturing,"" Cook was quoted as saying.

Moreover, the interview also covered Apple's environmental initiatives, including the carbon footprint of the new Apple Watch Series 9.

Cook said he wants Apple to demonstrate that going carbon neutral can be profitable so that other companies can ""rip it off."" Apple's overall carbon footprint is decreasing, according to the company.

Apple ended the use of leather across all of its product lines as part of its ambitious 2030 climate goal.

The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 per cent post-consumer recycled content.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,"China's economic recovery impact on S&P 500 limited, investors remain cautious",https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-economic-recovery-impact-on-sp-500-limited-investors-remain-cautious-93CH-3814598,"The ongoing economic recovery in China may not significantly impact the , despite its sluggish pace. This was reported on Monday, suggesting that Chinese operations contribute to merely 5% of the total revenue of companies listed in the S&P 500, according to Scott Chronert from Citi.

Chronert further pointed out that a total loss of revenue from China would result in about a 7% decrease in the S&P 500 earnings, a substantial but not disastrous scenario. A 5% reduction in revenue from China would lead to a slight 0.3% decline in earnings-per-share (EPS) for the index. If half of all revenue from China were eliminated, the S&P 500 EPS would drop by approximately 3.4%.

However, investors are advised to stay vigilant as a slowdown in China could potentially cause future problems. This is particularly relevant for companies with significant weightings in the index, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). These seven major companies earn more than 10% of their revenue from China. Therefore, while the overall risk to the index is relatively minor, there might be pockets of risk and volatility if there's a significant slowdown in China.

Certain industries like tech, autos, household products, and pharma have a higher-than-average exposure to China which could lead to an unstable profit outlook. Furthermore, some U.S. businesses are at an even greater risk as they derive over 30% of their revenue from China. These include Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: ), Aptiv (NYSE: ), Estée Lauder, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ: )., Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ).

Despite recent positive news about Chinese retail sales and industrial production, investors remain cautious. In August alone, foreign investors withdrew nearly $15 billion from Chinese stocks. While U.S. stocks have so far avoided the volatility experienced by offshore Chinese counterparts this year due to hopes of economic recovery, companies with substantial China exposure may continue to be viewed as less attractive by some investors.

This move comes as the strikes approach day 140, with negotiations between the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) set to resume later this week.

The suspension affects several studios including Feigco Entertainment, The Tannenbaum Co., Timberman/Beverly Productions, Groundswell Productions, and ""Power"" Universe star Joseph Sikora. Despite the suspension, Lionsgate plans to continue paying assistants and development executives under the suspended deals until October 1, with potential extensions if deemed necessary.

This decision by Lionsgate follows similar actions taken by other studios such as Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), NBCUniversal, Warner Bros. TV, and CBS Studios over the past few weeks. These suspensions predominantly impact non-writing executive producers.

Disney and CBS Studios have pledged to continue paying salaries for impacted assistants through the end of 2022. Development executives at Disney will also receive their salaries through the first week of October.

The first wave of suspensions began in early May, primarily affecting writers just days into the WGA strike. The industry has seen more rolling suspensions over the past couple of months as more producers concluded work on shows amidst an industry-wide production shutdown.

As the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes continue into the fall, there is a glimmer of hope as negotiations between WGA and AMPTP are set to resume this Wednesday.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Apple’s Vision Pro Headset to Support Lossless Audio, iPhone and iPad Still Waiting",https://in.investing.com/news/apples-vision-pro-headset-to-support-lossless-audio-iphone-and-ipad-still-waiting-93CH-3814044,"Apple (NASDAQ: )'s recently announced Vision Pro headset will be the first device to support lossless audio, a feature that is yet to be introduced on the iPhone 15, iPad, or Apple TV 4K, according to information released on Monday. This decision has sparked discussions among tech enthusiasts who believe the cutting-edge technology should have been implemented across more widely used devices like the iPhone or iPad.

Lossless audio, which refers to audio files that have not been compressed in any way, offers superior sound quality. However, achieving lossless audio playback requires a wired connection between a computer or laptop and headphones or a wireless speaker connected via Wi-Fi to a phone or tablet.

The Vision Pro headset, a premium product priced at $3,499, uses a new unnamed wireless protocol developed by Apple. This protocol employs Apple's H2 Wireless Chip found in both the AirPods Pro 2 and the Vision Pro along with new software reserved for the Vision Pro's launch. Unfortunately, this software or some other undisclosed feature appears to be missing from devices like the iPhone 15, iPad, and Apple TV 4K, meaning they won't support lossless audio.

The exclusion of lossless audio from these devices is seen as a missed opportunity given their popularity and widespread usage. However, there is an expectation that Apple will eventually extend this technology to its iPhones and iPads. It is suggested that within the next 12 months, Apple may announce additional products supporting lossless audio.

In addition to the Vision Pro announcement, Apple has also launched an upgraded version of its second-generation AirPods Pro. The new model includes improved dust resistance and a USB-C charging port instead of Apple's 'Lightning' port. While sound quality remains similar to its predecessor, the new AirPods Pro 2 can now be charged directly from an iPhone, a feature not previously available.

The new AirPods Pro 2 also supports lossless audio specifically designed for Apple's Vision Pro headset, which is set to be available in early 2024. Other features of the iOS 17 update for iPhones, which will also apply to all AirPods Pro, include 'adaptive audio' and 'conversational awareness'.

Despite the disappointment over the limited availability of lossless audio support, the future of this technology remains promising as Apple continues to innovate in the realm of audio quality and user experience.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,PayPal Braces for Leadership Change Amidst Challenges and Stagnant Growth,https://in.investing.com/news/paypal-braces-for-leadership-change-amidst-challenges-and-stagnant-growth-93CH-3813875,"Monday, September 18, 2022 - PayPal (NASDAQ: ) is preparing for a significant transition as Alex Chriss is set to assume the role of chief executive on September 27, succeeding current CEO Dan Schulman. Schulman, however, will continue to serve on PayPal's board until May 2024.

The leadership change comes during a challenging period for the fintech giant. Over the past two years, PayPal's shares have plummeted by over 75%, attributable to diminishing investor interest in fintech companies, escalating competition from Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and a slowdown in its branded checkout business growth.

Chriss, an experienced executive hailing from Intuit (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is perceived as a potential catalyst for PayPal's recovery. However, Wall Street analysts caution that the company's turnaround could be a protracted process.

Lisa Ellis, an analyst from MoffettNathanson, recently downgraded PayPal's shares from Outperform to Market Perform and reduced her price target on the shares from $85 to $75. Ellis attributed this downgrade to Apple's growing dominance in the payments sector and its implications for PayPal. She also pointed out that PayPal's gross profit growth has stagnated over the years, transitioning from double digits between 2018 and 2021 to low- to mid-single digits currently.

Ellis further emphasized that Chriss faces a formidable task of filling key roles within the company. PayPal currently has several positions either vacant or filled on an interim basis, including chief operating officer, chief financial officer, treasurer, and chief strategy officer. Amidst the company's ongoing struggles, attracting top-tier talent could be a significant challenge.

Despite these hurdles, the upcoming leadership change presents an opportunity for PayPal to recalibrate its strategic direction. However, analysts suggest that substantial changes might require time.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Apple's iPhone 15 sees promising preorders, lifting hopes for stock recovery",https://in.investing.com/news/apples-iphone-15-sees-promising-preorders-lifting-hopes-for-stock-recovery-93CH-3813794,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s shares, which recently witnessed a mild dip following the release of the iPhone 15, might be poised for a rebound. The tech giant has seen a surge in preorders for its latest smartphone, which are up by 10% to 12% compared to the same period for its predecessor, the iPhone 14, as per an analysis by Wedbush on Monday.

Wedbush's Daniel Ives expressed increased confidence in the new iPhone's success based on recent supply-chain checks in Asia. The checks suggest that Apple could sell approximately 85 million units initially, with the possibility of nearing 90 million due to compelling carrier promotions anticipated throughout the holiday season.

Apple's shares have been under some pressure recently, trading at $174.69 in premarket trading on Monday, marking a slight decrease of 0.2%. This follows a drift from highs of around $195 in late July 2022, a decline partly attributed to concerns over a potential ban on iPhone usage by Chinese government officials.

Further positive news for Apple comes from the distribution of these preorders. Ives noted a noticeable lean towards the more expensive Pro and Pro Max models of the iPhone 15. As a result, Wedbush predicts that Apple could see an average selling price of approximately $925 for their latest smartphone, marking an increase of around $100 compared to sales over the past year to 15 months.

Public data also supports this trend towards higher-end models. Delivery dates for the iPhone 15 Pro Max have been pushed back until November in several countries, including the U.S., indicating strong demand.

Despite caution regarding Apple's short-term setup from Mizuho analyst Jordan Klein, he also advised against underestimating the potential impact of these promising iPhone 15 data points.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Imagination Technologies plans New York IPO amid global chip industry boom,https://in.investing.com/news/imagination-technologies-plans-new-york-ipo-amid-global-chip-industry-boom-93CH-3813745,"Imagination Technologies, a U.K.-based semiconductor firm, is reportedly planning to go public in New York, marking a significant return to public markets since it was delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2017. The move comes on the heels of the successful initial public offering (IPO) of Arm, another chip designer, which achieved a valuation of $54 billion, becoming the largest IPO of the year.

Imagination's business model, similar to Arm's, involves licensing its semiconductor intellectual property to other companies. The company was taken private in 2017 by Canyon Bridge, an investment group backed by China, in a deal worth $742 million.

The news of Imagination's potential IPO follows a surge in investor interest in artificial intelligence (AI), which has boosted shares in chip companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and added momentum to Arm's IPO. Wall Street expects that Arm's successful listing could invigorate capital markets and pave the way for more companies to go public.

Imagination's client roster includes tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its primary focus is on designing chips for various applications, including self-driving cars and cloud computing. A key product offering is neural network accelerators that power AI. Thus, if it goes public, Imagination could offer investors a more direct opportunity to invest in AI.

According to filings made last week, Imagination reported annual revenue of £120 million ($149 million) for 2022, up from £111 million in 2021. The company has identified the automotive sector as one of its more resilient target markets compared to the overall semiconductor market.

2022-09-18, IANS,iOS 17 arrives with new features across Apple’s first-party apps,https://in.investing.com/news/ios-17-arrives-with-new-features-across-apples-firstparty-apps-3813616,"New Delhi, Sep 18 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) iOS 17 was all set to be officially available globally, including in India, on Monday as a free software update for newly-launched iPhone 15 series, including the older models, with a slew of improved security features.The iOS 17 offers new features across Apple’s first-party apps, including the Phone app, Messages, FaceTime, and more, and introduces new functionality like Live Voicemail, FaceTime audio and video messages.

“We’ve also reimagined AirDrop with new ways to share, autocorrect gets even better, and we’re introducing all-new experiences with Journal and StandBy,” according to Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering.

The Phone app gets major updates, with Contact Posters that allow users to customise how they appear to their contacts, and Live Voicemail, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message.

Messages gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and Check In, which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely, according to Apple.

NameDrop gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together.

The same gesture can be used to AirDrop content and more, and now users can step away from each other and finish sending large files over the internet.

StandBy gives users a customisable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging. With the Always-On display of iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, StandBy stays on to show useful information -- perfect on a desk, nightstand, or kitchen counter.

Interactive widgets on the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and in StandBy allow users to take action with just a tap, making it easy to complete a to-do, or play or pause a song right from the widget.

Safari adds greater protection for Private Browsing and introduces profiles, helping users separate their browsing for topics like work and personal.

iOS 17 delivers many more updates, including Journal, a new app that helps iPhone users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, improvements to autocorrect and Dictation that make entering text faster and easier than ever before, password and passkey sharing with iCloud Keychain, and much more.

A key addition to Lockdown Mode is that it now runs on Apple Watch, not just iPhones, iPads and Macs. Lockdown Mode in iOS 17 also automatically removes the geolocation data from photos by default when sharing photos with other people.

Private browsing will also lock by default, prompting the device owner to scan their face or fingerprint before their private tabs will open.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Apple stock pops as analysts say iPhone 15 demand is outpacing supply,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-stock-pops-as-analysts-say-iphone-15-demand-is-outpacing-supply-432SI-3813411,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares rose modestly in pre-open Monday after several Wall Street analysts weighed in on the lead times for iPhone 15.

Analysts are expressing optimism regarding the tech giant's pre-orders for the latest iPhone 15, saying that demand is surpassing expectations. Accordingly, delivery times for the iPhone 15 Pro have extended into November for certain configurations, indicating strong demand.

According to Morgan Stanley, the early data indicates a solid start to the cycle with the iPhone 15 Pro Max experiencing the longest lead times of any model launched in the past seven years. China data points are also exceeding expectations.

Goldman Sachs analysts flag the extended lead times for high-end models.

“We view the extended lead times for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max as a positive indication of consumer demand and for increasing price/mix, but recognize that there is little transparency into supply, which could be impacted by potential supply chain constraints, particularly in the Pro Max,” they said in a client note.

“Separately, we're encouraged by US carrier promotions available for the iPhone 15 family of devices, which appear largely consistent with year-ago and provide opportunities for consumers to cover the full purchase price of a new phone with an eligible trade-in; that said, the most attractive promotions require consumers to have - or upgrade to - some of the carrier's newer, more expensive plans,” the analysts added.

Wedbush analysts described carrier promotions as “eye-popping”, serving as “a major catalyst for upgrades this holiday season.”

“We believe iPhone units should level out in the 225 million unit range in FY24 and a rising ASP lift which is being underestimated by the Street as Cupertino has a massive pent-up installed base upgrade cycle now underway. This speaks to the underlying demand story that Apple anticipates for this next iPhone release with our estimates that ~250 million+ of 1.2 billion iPhone users worldwide have not upgraded their phones in over 4 years,” they wrote."

""Fully committed to support and facilitate,"" Vaishnaw said on X in response to Foxconn India representative V Lee's LinkedIn post to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 73rd birthday in which he said the company was “aiming for another doubling of employment, FDI (foreign direct investment), and business size in India” by this time next year.

Foxconn is the main assembler of Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones and both companies are keen to move away from China and create alternative supply chains.

The Communist giant stands alienated due to its military muscle-flexing in the South China Sea and dubious role in the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic that destroyed lives and livelihoods across the world.

Foxconn already has an iPhone factory in Tamil Nadu (NS: ), which employs 40,000 people and has signed an agreement to invest Rs 1,600 crore in a new electronics components unit in the state that will create 6,000 jobs.

The company has also announced that it will be investing an additional Rs 3,300 crore in its manufacturing facility in Telangana. This will take the total investment of the company in the state to more than Rs 4,550 crore.

The upcoming unit, being set up by Foxconn Interconnect Technology Ltd (FIT), will manufacture Apple accessories and is located at Kongara Kalan on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

Besides, the company had also announced in August that it would invest Rs.5,000 crore ($600 million) in Karnataka for two projects in the state to make casing components for iPhones and for chip-making equipment.

Foxconn chairman Young Liu had visited India recently to attend the SemiconIndia 2022 event hosted for global semiconductor companies that was inaugurated by Narendra Modi in Gandhinagar recently.

Speaking at the event, the Foxconn chairman said, ""I can feel the determination of the Indian government. I am very optimistic about where it's headed.""

He highlighted the Buffalo Spirit of the Taiwan semiconductor industry, which is the ability to work hard without complaining and said that the same spirit could be applied to India.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway shows strong faith in Apple and itself,https://in.investing.com/news/buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-shows-strong-faith-in-apple-and-itself-93CH-3813282,"Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), led by CEO Warren Buffett, has shown significant interest in tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ) and its own company shares, according to the latest 13F filings and comments from the annual shareholder meeting. As of Monday this week, Apple reportedly accounted for 45.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's $354 billion investment portfolio, making it the clear top investment.

According to Buffett, there are four primary reasons why Apple is highly valued by his firm. First, Apple's brand recognition and customer loyalty are seen as key assets. Second, the company's innovative nature and consistent updates to its products are appreciated by Buffett and his team. Third, Buffett expresses complete trust in Apple's management team and its shift towards a platform business model with more emphasis on subscription services. Finally, Buffett appreciates Apple's substantial capital-return program, which includes one of the largest nominal-dollar dividend payouts among public companies and a stock repurchase program that has bought back approximately $600 billion worth of its common stock since 2013.

However, another stock that has caught the eye of Warren Buffett is none other than Berkshire Hathaway itself. A change in policy on July 17, 2018, allowed Buffett and executive vice chairman Charlie Munger more freedom to buy back their company's stock as long as they maintain at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on their balance sheet. Since this policy change, Berkshire Hathaway has consistently bought back its own shares for 20 consecutive quarters, totaling over $71 billion. This buyback program is viewed as a way to reward long-term investors by incrementally increasing their ownership stakes.

Furthermore, the buyback program has had a positive impact on Berkshire Hathaway's earnings per share (EPS), which should rise as the outstanding share count declines for businesses with steady or growing net income.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Leading U.S. banks set to launch 'Paze', a mobile wallet in response to tech giants",https://in.investing.com/news/leading-us-banks-set-to-launch-paze-a-mobile-wallet-in-response-to-tech-giants-93CH-3813153,"In the latest development in the ongoing competition between traditional banking institutions and tech giants, major American banks are preparing to introduce a mobile wallet, Paze, which will connect directly with the credit and debit card accounts of 150 million customers. The app, scheduled for launch next year, is a collective effort by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), and others. Early Warning Services, which operates the payment app Zelle, will manage Paze.

This move marks a significant shift in strategy for these banking giants. Previously, they believed they could individually compete against Big Tech and emerging fintech startups. However, the rise of tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the financial services sector has led these banks to reconsider their approach.

Over recent years, JPMorgan Chase has partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple to expand their banking services. In a similar vein, Citi has inked a deal to finance Amazon's installment payment offering. This trend is not just confined to the United States. In Europe, Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) is exploring partnerships with fintech companies, while Orange's banking division in France has made deals with fintechs Younited and Mambu for digital lending and online banking platforms respectively.

Nevertheless, these collaborations have not been without regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential risks these partnerships could pose to banks and the wider U.S. banking system.

The mobile wallet market has become a key area of competition between banks and tech companies. Banks have traditionally dominated consumer payments but the rise of Apple Pay has challenged this dominance. While Apple does not disclose official usage statistics for its mobile wallet, it is reported that over 500 million users have adopted Apple Pay in just five years.

In hopes of emulating their success with Zelle - which since its 2017 launch has become the largest peer-to-peer payment app with transactions totaling $629 billion last year - banks are launching Paze. Yet, the handling of fraud cases involving Zelle has drawn criticism towards these banks.

The success of Paze will largely rely on banks' willingness to allow it to connect directly to customers' bank accounts, giving it a potential advantage over Apple Pay. The Paze team recently recruited Cameron Fowler, a top executive from BMO Financial Group, as its next CEO. However, details about Paze's functionality and whether users will be able to access their account information through the app remain limited.

With tech companies continuing to expand their financial services offerings and banks striving to maintain their market share, the future of the financial services industry remains uncertain.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Arm's big debut, Apple's new iPhone, Qualcomm's Apple pact, Oracle's disappointment, and an AI-driven Tesla upgrade.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""

""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.

For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:

""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL? No. We continue to believe that the three legs of growth either still have much to go (SaaS), are at a very early stage (OCI), or are only just beginning (On Prem database migration to the Cloud). We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

However, when asked whether Apple should be advertising on X, he said that this is something the company ""constantly"" asks itself.

Further, the Apple CEO was asked about the release date of the Vision Pro as according to reports, the headset is facing manufacturing delays, on which Cook confirmed that the Vision Pro is still on schedule, restating his statements from last week's iPhone 15 ""Wonderlust"" event.

When Cook was asked whether the challenges he faced in creating the iPhone were the same with the Vision Pro, he said it was ""more complex"".

""No, it's more complex, and so it requires innovation in not only the development, but also in the manufacturing,"" Cook was quoted as saying.

Moreover, the interview also covered Apple's environmental initiatives, including the carbon footprint of the new Apple Watch Series 9.

Cook said he wants Apple to demonstrate that going carbon neutral can be profitable so that other companies can ""rip it off."" Apple's overall carbon footprint is decreasing, according to the company.

Apple ended the use of leather across all of its product lines as part of its ambitious 2030 climate goal.

The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 per cent post-consumer recycled content.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

2022-09-16, IANS,Amazon hires Spyglass and Universal Studios veteran to heads its MGM acquisition venture,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-hires-spyglass-and-universal-studios-veteran-to-heads-its-mgm-acquisition-venture-3812309,"Los Angeles, Sep 17 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) MGM Studios has grabbed veteran Peter Oillataguerre from Spyglass to make him its Head of Feature Film Production. Oillataguerre is taking on the newly created role of head of feature film production for Amazon MGM Studios, Hollywood Reporter reported.

The highly rated executive, who comes from Spyglass, will report to Dan Scharf, head of global business operations, and is expected to work closely with head of film, streaming and theatrical Courtenay Valenti and the company's film teams as the newly B2B home delivery to films ventures seeks to expand its footprint in the entertainment industry and Hollywood.

""Peter brings with him more than 20 years of industry experience. He is a veteran executive with tremendous expertise in the world of production. In his new Avatar, he will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the feature film production cycle for the Amazon MGM Studios film group,"" Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, wrote in an email to staff on Friday.

At Spyglass, Oillataguerre worked on films such as 'Scream', 'Hellraiser' and 'The Upside', and also worked on TV series 'Project Runway'. Prior to Spyglass, he worked at Universal Studios and MGM Studios, with projects, including James Bond features 'Skyfall' and 'No Time to Die', as well as 'Creed'.

Amazon gave Ben Affleck’s 'Air' a global theatrical release, considered significant as streamers had been reluctant to grant traditional releases to their properties previously. The studio has multiple titles due out later this year, including 'Totally Killer' streaming on October 6. It is giving Emerald Fennell's festival feature 'Saltburn' a limited release on November 24, Hollywood Reporter said.

Amazon acquired MGM Studios for a record $8.45 billion, making it its bold B2B deal and foray into the entertainment industry, thus turbocharging its streaming ambitions, considered its second biggest deal after it acquired Whole Foods grocery chain in the US. The deal is the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history, behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.

Amazon hopes to leverage MGM's storied filmmaking history and wide-ranging catalog of 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to help bolster Amazon Studios, its film and TV division. Prime Video watchers would now be able to watch a richer fare of movies and TV serials across the globe as Amazon expands its footprint in the show business, as it competes fiercely with HBO, Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney Hulu OTT platforms.

Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, had called the deal then clinched way back in 2021 as: ""It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.""

In a statement, MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich had then said: ""The opportunity to align MGM's storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.""

Amazon shares barely moved up on the merger announcement then in the New York Stock Exchange.

Apple shares initially rose to a high of $176.50 on the news before falling back below yesterday's close, currently sitting at $175.20.

Bloomberg said that out of the four iPhone 15 models that became available for pre-order on Friday in several countries, the Pro Max's first deliveries slipped from September 22 to as late as October 16.

The delays are said to have impacted all colors of the model and most storage capacities.

Home deliveries are impacted by the delays, but the report from Bloomberg says many of Apple's around 270 retail stores in the US still have day-one availability for in-store pick-up. However, in China, there are shipment delays of four to five weeks for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand. Further concerns were raised regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone."

This is higher than the hourly rate of 21 yuan offered at Foxconn’s integrated Digital Product Business Group (iDPBG), which makes iPhones, the report claimed.

A recruitment agent was quoted as saying that the “new hires will know what phone they are making after the factory allocates them to different teams based on current demand, but these days they have a higher chance of making handsets for Huawei”.

Foxconn did not immediately comment on the report.

Both Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Huawei have launched their flagship 5G handsets in China which is the world’s biggest smartphone market.

Although China remains its most important production centre, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain amid rising geopolitical tensions, said the report.

The tech giant will sell ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 on the global sales day (September 22) for the first time.

Meanwhile, Foxconn, which is the largest iPhone maker, had ramped up hiring in China ahead of Apple's launch of iPhone 15 series earlier this week.

Foxconn’s major plant in Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province, is offering $880 as bonuses per person at the company’s Product Enclosure Business Group, responsible for producing mechanical parts for the iPhone.

The world’s largest iPhone factory is “continuing to expand its workforce ahead of the release of the iPhone 15, with Apple hoping to avoid last year’s supply chain woes at the plant in China,” the report said.

Foxconn offered larger bonuses to returning workers in June this year following a worker exodus and production disruptions.

""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France,"" the iPhone maker said in a statement.

According to reports, Apple said the software patch is “related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern”.

The Cupertoni, California-based company had earlier said that iPhone 12 has been certified by several international regulators as compliant.

The French government welcomed the move, saying the “ANFR is preparing to quickly test this update”.

The tech giant, which just launched iPhone 15 series, had said it has independent third-party lab results that show that it complies with all Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) standards globally.

The most common EU SAR limit of 2 W/kg represents an average over 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal, reports TechCrunch. This limit is a bit higher than the FCC limit in the U.S. (1.6 W/kg). Apple complies with this SAR limit.

This decision, revealed during Apple's mega event ""Wonderlust,"" is expected to herald a new era for the tech giant as it moves away from its proprietary lightning wire. The move has been met with widespread approval, including praise from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO and Twitter owner, Elon Musk.

Elon Musk hailed Apple's decision as ""amazing"" in a tweet on Tuesday, September 13, 2022. Musk's approval is particularly noteworthy given his previous criticisms of Apple over issues such as their platform fees and their stance on free speech.

﻿The switch to USB-C is considered a positive development for consumers who will no longer need to carry multiple chargers for different devices. It is also expected to be beneficial for the environment by reducing electronic waste production annually.

Apple's decision comes after years of resistance to adopting USB-C charging—a standard charging port for most Android smartphones and other devices—and following increasing pressure from consumers and regulatory bodies. The European Union has passed a law requiring all smartphones sold in the EU to use USB-C charging by 2024.

Despite Musk's past threats to create his own smartphone if Apple banned Twitter from its app store, his praise for Apple's decision underscores the significance of this move. The iPhone 15 is the first ever iPhone to use USB-C charging, marking a major shift in Apple's product strategy.

(NASDAQ: ), the tech giant with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, has been a significant investment for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), yielding substantial returns since its initial purchase in 2016. As of Thursday, Berkshire's stake in Apple stands at $164 billion, making up 46% of its total public equities portfolio. The value of this investment has surged by 577% as of September 8, 2022, outpacing the Index's 175% rise over the same period.

Apple's success has been attributed to its brand strength and customer loyalty. Interbrand ranks Apple as the world's most valuable brand, estimated at $482 billion. The company's combination of popular hardware products, primarily the iPhone, and user-friendly software has fostered a robust ecosystem fostering customer loyalty and high switching costs.

The company's financial health over the past three years has also attracted investors like Buffett. From fiscal 2020 to 2022, Apple generated $277 billion in free cash flow and currently holds a net cash position of $57 billion on its balance sheet.

When Buffett first invested in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, the company's average trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was just 10.6, indicating that the market wasn't overly optimistic about the business at that time.

However, potential investors today are met with a different scenario. Despite being a colossal enterprise with trailing 12-month revenues nearing $400 billion and more than 2 billion active devices worldwide, Apple has seen revenue decrease year-over-year for the past three quarters. This trend raises questions about future growth potential.

Furthermore, Apple's current trailing P/E ratio stands at 30, approximately three times higher than when Buffett first invested. This valuation, coupled with signs of slowing growth, may discourage investors seeking market-beating returns. As such, while Berkshire Hathaway remains a significant shareholder, potential investors should carefully consider the current state of affairs before buying into Apple.

The IPO price was already at the top end of Arm's indicated range, and secured the British company a valuation of $54.5 billion.

The listing -- the largest since electric-truck maker Rivian (NASDAQ: )'s roughly $12B debut in 2021 -- was fueled by strong demand that saw the stock heavily oversubscribed. Many of Arm's biggest clients, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have already signed up to be cornerstone investors.

The IPO's value is lower than the $64 billion Arm-owner SoftBank (TYO: ) spent last month to acquire the 25% stake in the business it did not already own. However, it is still more than SoftBank's $40 billion sale of Arm to Nvidia that was scuttled in 2022 following regulatory opposition.

Arm's flotation will likely serve as a bellwether for the recently dormant IPO market, which has fallen relatively silent due to economic uncertainty and elevated interest rates."

""For example, there are times when wind and solar projects produce more energy than the grid can use, leading to some of it being wasted. There are also times when electricity is being generated with lower emissions. By using electricity during these cleaner times, customers may lower the climate impact of the electricity they use at home,"" Apple explained.

Grid Forecast is available in the Home app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch devices running this fall's soon-to-be-released updates, with iOS 17 slated for a September 18 public launch.

It is also available as an iOS widget and a watch face complication and is available in the US. Apple said that Grid Forecast uses data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information into one, easy-to-follow signal.

This can help people make decisions about the best time to run large appliances and charge electric vehicles or devices throughout the day.

Meanwhile, Apple has announced its first-ever carbon-neutral products in the all-new Apple Watch lineup as part of its ambitious 2030 climate goal and also ended the use of leather across all of its product lines.

The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 per cent post-consumer recycled content.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

This is the first time the iPhone maker has extended support for NavIC to its iPhone models.

“After the successful missions of Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1, we have reached another big milestone with ISRO's NavIC technology. Now, for the very first time, the iPhone 15 Pro series has extended support for the NavIC technology. The endorsement of NavIC as a global positioning system technology, or a solution incorporated into the most popular and most widely used device in the world, is certainly not a small thing,” the minister told reporters.

India aims to expand NavIC coverage globally and it wants tech companies to make their devices compatible with the new standard before then.

To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, ISRO established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).

Accord Software and Systems is the first in India to design NavIC chips. They've created more than a million NAVIC IC chips using advanced 28-nanometer technology.

“We're planning to make it a standard practice that all devices using GPS technology should have NAVIC-powered chipsets or NAVIC chips inside. When you look at the IT PLI scheme this time, it includes incentives for system designers and manufacturers who incorporate Indian-designed chips into their products,” said Chandrasekhar.

As mobile phone designs and chip technology continue to mature and reach the granularity and the sophistication required for mobile devices, “the chips powering those devices could very well be NavIC chips,” he stressed.

NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1,500 km beyond Indian boundary, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

NavIC signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou.

According to Chandrasekhar, ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 represents another big milestone in the country’s electronic and semiconductor progress.

“Another milestone is that on the very same day, when a customer in New York, Tokyo or London receives brand-new iPhone 15, an Indian customer will also receive an iPhone 15. The only difference is that the iPhone in London is ‘Made in China’ while the iPhone in India is manufactured in India,” the minister emphasised.

This demonstrates the coming of age of India's presence in the global electronic supply chain, he added.

With iPhone 15, Apple has made India a sweet spot in its future scheme of things, as it doubles down on local manufacturing.

Driven by the premiumisation of the smartphone market, uptick in first-time users who are shifting from Android to the Apple ecosystem and a young population, India is now among the top five global markets for Apple.

In his new Avatar, he will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the feature film production cycle for the Amazon MGM Studios film group,"" Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, wrote in an email to staff on Friday.

At Spyglass, Oillataguerre worked on films such as 'Scream', 'Hellraiser' and 'The Upside', and also worked on TV series 'Project Runway'. Prior to Spyglass, he worked at Universal Studios and MGM Studios, with projects, including James Bond features 'Skyfall' and 'No Time to Die', as well as 'Creed'.

Amazon gave Ben Affleck’s 'Air' a global theatrical release, considered significant as streamers had been reluctant to grant traditional releases to their properties previously. The studio has multiple titles due out later this year, including 'Totally Killer' streaming on October 6. It is giving Emerald Fennell's festival feature 'Saltburn' a limited release on November 24, Hollywood Reporter said.

Amazon acquired MGM Studios for a record $8.45 billion, making it its bold B2B deal and foray into the entertainment industry, thus turbocharging its streaming ambitions, considered its second biggest deal after it acquired Whole Foods grocery chain in the US. The deal is the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history, behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.

Amazon hopes to leverage MGM's storied filmmaking history and wide-ranging catalog of 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to help bolster Amazon Studios, its film and TV division. Prime Video watchers would now be able to watch a richer fare of movies and TV serials across the globe as Amazon expands its footprint in the show business, as it competes fiercely with HBO, Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney Hulu OTT platforms.

Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, had called the deal then clinched way back in 2021 as: ""It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.""

In a statement, MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich had then said: ""The opportunity to align MGM's storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.""

Amazon shares barely moved up on the merger announcement then in the New York Stock Exchange.

Apple shares initially rose to a high of $176.50 on the news before falling back below yesterday's close, currently sitting at $175.20.

Bloomberg said that out of the four iPhone 15 models that became available for pre-order on Friday in several countries, the Pro Max's first deliveries slipped from September 22 to as late as October 16.

The delays are said to have impacted all colors of the model and most storage capacities.

Home deliveries are impacted by the delays, but the report from Bloomberg says many of Apple's around 270 retail stores in the US still have day-one availability for in-store pick-up. However, in China, there are shipment delays of four to five weeks for the iPhone 15 Pro Max.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand. Further concerns were raised regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone."

This is higher than the hourly rate of 21 yuan offered at Foxconn’s integrated Digital Product Business Group (iDPBG), which makes iPhones, the report claimed.

A recruitment agent was quoted as saying that the “new hires will know what phone they are making after the factory allocates them to different teams based on current demand, but these days they have a higher chance of making handsets for Huawei”.

Foxconn did not immediately comment on the report.

Both Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Huawei have launched their flagship 5G handsets in China which is the world’s biggest smartphone market.

Although China remains its most important production centre, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain amid rising geopolitical tensions, said the report.

The tech giant will sell ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 on the global sales day (September 22) for the first time.

Meanwhile, Foxconn, which is the largest iPhone maker, had ramped up hiring in China ahead of Apple's launch of iPhone 15 series earlier this week.

Foxconn’s major plant in Zhengzhou, capital of central Henan province, is offering $880 as bonuses per person at the company’s Product Enclosure Business Group, responsible for producing mechanical parts for the iPhone.

The world’s largest iPhone factory is “continuing to expand its workforce ahead of the release of the iPhone 15, with Apple hoping to avoid last year’s supply chain woes at the plant in China,” the report said.

Foxconn offered larger bonuses to returning workers in June this year following a worker exodus and production disruptions.

""We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France,"" the iPhone maker said in a statement.

According to reports, Apple said the software patch is “related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern”.

The Cupertoni, California-based company had earlier said that iPhone 12 has been certified by several international regulators as compliant.

The French government welcomed the move, saying the “ANFR is preparing to quickly test this update”.

The tech giant, which just launched iPhone 15 series, had said it has independent third-party lab results that show that it complies with all Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) standards globally.

The most common EU SAR limit of 2 W/kg represents an average over 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal, reports TechCrunch. This limit is a bit higher than the FCC limit in the U.S. (1.6 W/kg). Apple complies with this SAR limit.

“Infosys has been featured in TIME World’s Best Companies 2022 list. We are among the top 3 global professional services firms and the only brand from India in the Top 100 global rankings,” the company said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

This decision, revealed during Apple's mega event ""Wonderlust,"" is expected to herald a new era for the tech giant as it moves away from its proprietary lightning wire. The move has been met with widespread approval, including praise from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) CEO and Twitter owner, Elon Musk.

Elon Musk hailed Apple's decision as ""amazing"" in a tweet on Tuesday, September 13, 2022. Musk's approval is particularly noteworthy given his previous criticisms of Apple over issues such as their platform fees and their stance on free speech.

﻿The switch to USB-C is considered a positive development for consumers who will no longer need to carry multiple chargers for different devices. It is also expected to be beneficial for the environment by reducing electronic waste production annually.

Apple's decision comes after years of resistance to adopting USB-C charging—a standard charging port for most Android smartphones and other devices—and following increasing pressure from consumers and regulatory bodies. The European Union has passed a law requiring all smartphones sold in the EU to use USB-C charging by 2024.

Despite Musk's past threats to create his own smartphone if Apple banned Twitter from its app store, his praise for Apple's decision underscores the significance of this move. The iPhone 15 is the first ever iPhone to use USB-C charging, marking a major shift in Apple's product strategy.

(NASDAQ: ), the tech giant with a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion, has been a significant investment for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ), yielding substantial returns since its initial purchase in 2016. As of Thursday, Berkshire's stake in Apple stands at $164 billion, making up 46% of its total public equities portfolio. The value of this investment has surged by 577% as of September 8, 2022, outpacing the Index's 175% rise over the same period.

Apple's success has been attributed to its brand strength and customer loyalty. Interbrand ranks Apple as the world's most valuable brand, estimated at $482 billion. The company's combination of popular hardware products, primarily the iPhone, and user-friendly software has fostered a robust ecosystem fostering customer loyalty and high switching costs.

The company's financial health over the past three years has also attracted investors like Buffett. From fiscal 2020 to 2022, Apple generated $277 billion in free cash flow and currently holds a net cash position of $57 billion on its balance sheet.

When Buffett first invested in Apple in the first quarter of 2016, the company's average trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio was just 10.6, indicating that the market wasn't overly optimistic about the business at that time.

However, potential investors today are met with a different scenario. Despite being a colossal enterprise with trailing 12-month revenues nearing $400 billion and more than 2 billion active devices worldwide, Apple has seen revenue decrease year-over-year for the past three quarters. This trend raises questions about future growth potential.

Furthermore, Apple's current trailing P/E ratio stands at 30, approximately three times higher than when Buffett first invested. This valuation, coupled with signs of slowing growth, may discourage investors seeking market-beating returns. As such, while Berkshire Hathaway remains a significant shareholder, potential investors should carefully consider the current state of affairs before buying into Apple.

The IPO price was already at the top end of Arm's indicated range, and secured the British company a valuation of $54.5 billion.

The listing -- the largest since electric-truck maker Rivian (NASDAQ: )'s roughly $12B debut in 2021 -- was fueled by strong demand that saw the stock heavily oversubscribed. Many of Arm's biggest clients, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have already signed up to be cornerstone investors.

The IPO's value is lower than the $64 billion Arm-owner SoftBank (TYO: ) spent last month to acquire the 25% stake in the business it did not already own. However, it is still more than SoftBank's $40 billion sale of Arm to Nvidia that was scuttled in 2022 following regulatory opposition.

Arm's flotation will likely serve as a bellwether for the recently dormant IPO market, which has fallen relatively silent due to economic uncertainty and elevated interest rates."

They believe consumer spending pauses ahead of the new Apple product launches were likely a contributing driver.

""While it is tough to discern the impact of slower consumer spending relative to anticipation of the launch of iPhone 15 in the results for July, interestingly, share declined across AT&T (NYSE: ) and T-Mobile - which are also the carriers that appear to be offering the most compelling trade-in offers on the newly launched iPhone 15 relative to Verizon (NYSE: ) where iPhone 14 increased share in the month of July,"" the analysts, who have an Overweight rating on Apple shares, said.

There are also times when electricity is being generated with lower emissions. By using electricity during these cleaner times, customers may lower the climate impact of the electricity they use at home,"" Apple explained.

Grid Forecast is available in the Home app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch devices running this fall's soon-to-be-released updates, with iOS 17 slated for a September 18 public launch.

It is also available as an iOS widget and a watch face complication and is available in the US. Apple said that Grid Forecast uses data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information into one, easy-to-follow signal.

This can help people make decisions about the best time to run large appliances and charge electric vehicles or devices throughout the day.

Meanwhile, Apple has announced its first-ever carbon-neutral products in the all-new Apple Watch lineup as part of its ambitious 2030 climate goal and also ended the use of leather across all of its product lines.

The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 per cent post-consumer recycled content.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

This is the first time the iPhone maker has extended support for NavIC to its iPhone models.

“After the successful missions of Chandrayaan-3 and Aditya-L1, we have reached another big milestone with ISRO's NavIC technology. Now, for the very first time, the iPhone 15 Pro series has extended support for the NavIC technology. The endorsement of NavIC as a global positioning system technology, or a solution incorporated into the most popular and most widely used device in the world, is certainly not a small thing,” the minister told reporters.

India aims to expand NavIC coverage globally and it wants tech companies to make their devices compatible with the new standard before then.

To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, ISRO established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).

Accord Software and Systems is the first in India to design NavIC chips. They've created more than a million NAVIC IC chips using advanced 28-nanometer technology.

“We're planning to make it a standard practice that all devices using GPS technology should have NAVIC-powered chipsets or NAVIC chips inside. When you look at the IT PLI scheme this time, it includes incentives for system designers and manufacturers who incorporate Indian-designed chips into their products,” said Chandrasekhar.

As mobile phone designs and chip technology continue to mature and reach the granularity and the sophistication required for mobile devices, “the chips powering those devices could very well be NavIC chips,” he stressed.

NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1,500 km beyond Indian boundary, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

NavIC signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou.

According to Chandrasekhar, ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 represents another big milestone in the country’s electronic and semiconductor progress.

“Another milestone is that on the very same day, when a customer in New York, Tokyo or London receives brand-new iPhone 15, an Indian customer will also receive an iPhone 15. The only difference is that the iPhone in London is ‘Made in China’ while the iPhone in India is manufactured in India,” the minister emphasised.

This demonstrates the coming of age of India's presence in the global electronic supply chain, he added.

With iPhone 15, Apple has made India a sweet spot in its future scheme of things, as it doubles down on local manufacturing.

Driven by the premiumisation of the smartphone market, uptick in first-time users who are shifting from Android to the Apple ecosystem and a young population, India is now among the top five global markets for Apple.

“That is below the $64 billion Arm owner SoftBank Group recently valued the company at when it bought out a stake held by its Vision Fund,” the report said.

The Japanese investment giant SoftBank acquired Arm for $31 billion in 2016.

Customers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, Intel (NASDAQ: ), AMD, TSMC, and Samsung (KS: ) have all said they will buy ARM shares.

Arm has filed for an IPO listing with , which is touted as the year’s biggest. Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2022.

The company has developed and licensed high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

Arm is a core supplier of architecture technology to most semiconductor companies. Its Arm instruction set is at the core of nearly all mobile processors powering smartphones, including those made by Apple and Android devices that use Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) chips.

Arm is reportedly developing its own chip, aiming to showcase the capabilities of its designs and attract new customers.

In the video, she explained that she was out for a walk with a friend and having a conversation and during that she took one of the earbuds out of her ear to hear more clearly.

Barker then decided to take her vitamins and popped the AirPod in her mouth. After that she realised that the vitamins were still in her hand.

“Halfway through my walk, I decided to take my vitamins, so I put my vitamins in, took a drink, and I was like, man, those are stuck,” Barker was quoted as saying.

“So I guzzled my water, kept on going, said bye to Kathleen, and went to go get my AirPods. And my pills were in my hand. I swallowed my AirPods,"" she added.

According to the report, she seems to be doing well, even taking moments to laugh at herself about the whole situation.

Baker mentioned that she immediately called doctors and friends for advice and they all told her the same thing -- to let it pass naturally, the report said.

Back in 2021, another US woman also swallowed an AirPod, thinking it was a vitamin.

She was surprised to discover that it still worked after recording a voice note and capturing her stomach sound.

Last year, a celebrity from the UK also gulped down her AirPod with her vitamins. However, she threw it up instead of letting it pass naturally.

2022-09-14, Investing.com,US chip self-reliance hindered by lack of packaging facilities despite TSMC's Arizona fab,https://in.investing.com/news/us-chip-selfreliance-hindered-by-lack-of-packaging-facilities-despite-tsmcs-arizona-fab-93CH-3808659,"The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has no plans to build a packaging facility in the US, according to a report published on Wednesday, September 13, 2022. This decision could pose significant challenges to America's bid to become a global leader in chip production by the end of the decade. The absence of a local packaging facility implies that chips manufactured at TSMC's $40 billion Arizona fab, due for completion in 2025, will have to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging.

The TSMC Arizona fab is a crucial part of President Joe Biden's plan to design and produce leading-edge logic chips, as reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2022. However, construction on the fab has been delayed due to a shortage of skilled US workers. Despite this, the fab remains integral to US infrastructure and military modernization efforts.

Last December, Apple (NASDAQ: ) announced it would become the Arizona fab's biggest customer. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that these chips could be proudly stamped ""Made in America"". However, Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, argued that without a local packaging facility, the Arizona fab is effectively a paperweight and does not significantly contribute to America's advanced chip supplies.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reported in 2021 that US semiconductor firms offshore almost all packaging processes, with only 46 facilities located domestically specializing in outsourced testing and assembly operations. Meanwhile, there are 107 such facilities in Taiwan and 111 in China—countries responsible for at least 81 percent of global chip assembly, packaging, and testing.

Apple hasn't specified how many chips it plans to purchase from the Arizona fab. The company might be planning to buy less advanced chips that could be packaged outside Taiwan for its iPads and MacBooks. However, more advanced chips used in the iPhone, Apple Watch, and advanced Mac desktops would still likely have to come from Taiwan.

TSMC employees told The Information that building a packaging facility in the US is unlikely due to high costs. Analysts also believe that the Arizona fab won't produce enough chips to justify TSMC building a packaging facility in the US. When fully operational, the fab will produce 600,000 wafers per year, a relatively small amount compared to the 15 million total wafers TSMC produced in 2022.

On Thursday, September 14, 2022, Dylan Patel reiterated his stance, stating that the TSMC Arizona fab will be little more than a paperweight in any geopolitical tension or war with China over Taiwan due to the need to send the chips back to Taiwan for packaging.

Apple said, in a statement, that iPhone 12 has been certified by several international regulators as compliant.

The tech giant, which just launched iPhone 15 series, said it has independent third-party lab results that show that it complies with all Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) standards globally.

Earlier, the ANFR released a public statement saying that the iPhone 12 breaches radiation levels, telling the company to temporarily halt iPhone 12 sales and release a fix.

""The French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR) is instructing Apple to withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market as of September 12, 2022, after the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limit for this model was exceeded,"" the French agency said in a statement.

""ANFR enjoins Apple to implement all available means to rapidly remedy this malfunction. Failing this, Apple will be required to recall any units already sold,"" it added.

The most common EU SAR limit of 2 W/kg represents an average over 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal, reports TechCrunch. This limit is a bit higher than the FCC limit in the U.S. (1.6 W/kg).

Apple complies with this SAR limit.

However, the ANFR measured an SAR of 5.74 W/kg, which is above the limit of 4 W/kg.

France’s junior minister for telecommunications, Jean-Noel Barrot, told Le Parisien that Apple has some time to comply with French regulations before further action.

The tech giant opened its own-branded Mumbai and Delhi retail stores in the country in April this year, which met with great enthusiasm.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year and according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year, according to latest data.

Apple iPhone shipments grew 68 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of this year in the country.

In the first half, Apple secured a 6 per cent market share in the Indian smartphone market and dominated the super-premium smartphone segment (priced between Rs 50,000-Rs 100,000) with a robust 63 per cent market share, according to market intelligence firm CyberMedia Research (CMR).

For the first time, Apple will sell ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 on the first day of its global sales, within the country as well as export to a few other markets sooner than ever before, according to sources.

A small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is set to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global availability which is September 22.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Last year, the tech giant started assembling the iPhone 14 at the Foxconn facility in India in September, a first in years when a new iPhone was assembled within weeks of its global launch in the country.

This time, Apple has also extended support for the Indian satellite navigation system NavIC for its high-end iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max models for location-based services.

It, however, is yet to reveal what features will be part of the NavIC support in the country.

Apple continues to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in its direct-to-consumer offers in the country.

""If you look at it, it’s the second largest smartphone market in the world and we ought to be doing really well there and we are very pleased with our growth there,"" Cook said last month.

""We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,"" the Apple CEO added.

2022-09-13, Investing.com,"CPI looms, Apple's newest iPhone, Arm's IPO pricing - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/cpi-looms-apples-newest-iphone-arms-ipo-pricing--whats-moving-markets-3807559,"Investing.com -- The release of key U.S. inflation data on Wednesday is in focus, as investors attempt to gauge how the numbers could impact Federal Reserve interest policy decisions. Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ: ) unveils incremental changes to its all-important iPhone device, while Arm reportedly gears up to price its initial public offering at the top end of its indicated range.

1. Futures edge lower ahead of key inflation data

U.S. stock futures inched lower on Wednesday, but stayed relatively close to the flatline, as traders awaited the release of crucial inflation figures later in the session that could help determine the path ahead for Federal Reserve monetary policy.

At 05:27 ET (09:27 GMT), the contract had slipped by 31 points or 0.1%, dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and fell marginally by 11 points or 0.1%.

All three of the main indices slumped in the prior session, with the in particular shedding 144 points or 1.0%. A drop in shares in business software group Oracle (NYSE: ) following a disappointing current-quarter revenue outlook, as well as a decline in Apple stock after the tech giant's annual fall hardware event, weighed on equity markets.

2. CPI seen accelerating in August

Attention now turns to the publication of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), a major gauge of price gains, for August.

Fed officials and markets alike will likely be keeping a close eye on the data, which may impact how the central bank will approach interest rate decisions over the rest of the year.

Economists expect the pace of in the world's largest economy to have picked up to 3.6% during the month from 3.2% in July, while the CPI is projected to accelerate to 0.6% from 0.2%, due in large part to a recent uptick in energy prices.

The core reading, which strips out volatile items like food and fuel, is anticipated to have slowed from 4.7% to 4.3% . On a monthly basis, the is seen holding steady at 0.2%.

Corraling elevated inflation has been a major objective of the Fed's nearly year-and-a-half long campaign of interest rate hikes. Policymakers are widely tipped to skip further tightening at their upcoming meeting this month, but uncertainty still remains over what they may choose to do later on in 2022. Wednesday's CPI print may bring some clarity to the matter.

3. Apple's incremental hardware update

Shares in Apple dipped on Tuesday after the tech giant revealed four new iPhone models at its annual hardware refresher, but refrained from launching major updates to the flagship device's design or software.

One of the most notable revisions to the latest iPhone 15 gadget is the first-ever inclusion of a universal USB-C charging port. Apple was under pressure to build in the feature in order to comply with European Union law that sets a common charging standard for all smartphones and portable electronic devices.

Pricing, meanwhile, remained at broadly the same levels as last year, although the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro Max was effectively bumped up $100 to $1,199 as Apple attempts to extract more money out of the top-of-the-line model.

The world's most valuable company has been moving to stem a slide in revenues in the last three quarters that has been linked to a slowdown in the global smartphone market. Concerns are also rising around Apple's demand and production in China following reports that government officials have been asked not to use iPhones for work. Meanwhile, Chinese rival Huawei has unveiled its own updated smartphone, threatening the California group's market share in the country.

4. Final pricing of Arm IPO expected - Reuters

Arm has reportedly secured enough investor backing to at least price its much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) at the top end of its indicated range, giving the British chip designer a fully diluted valuation of $54.5 billion.

According to a source quoted by Reuters, Arm chose to accept only the top end of its target band of $47 to $51 a share -- or an even higher price -- after reviewing a round of investor commitments. The company will decide how much it wants to sell its shares on Wednesday, Reuters said, citing the unnamed person and a second source.

Shares in Arm are currently set to begin trading in New York on Thursday.

Arm's IPO is expected to be the largest in almost two years. Strong demand for the flotation may also add fuel to the resurgent market for listings in the U.S., which had gone relatively dormant as firms shelved plans to go public due to worries over uncertain economic conditions. This week, e-commerce group Instacart, marketing automation company Klaviyo, and sandal maker Birkenstock have all teed up their own IPO plans.

5. Looney steps down as BP chief

Bernard Looney has resigned as Chief Executive Officer of BP (LON: ) (NYSE: ) over a failure to disclose all details surrounding his personal relationships with internal colleagues, the oil major announced.

In a statement, BP said Looney admitted that he was ""not fully transparent"" in prior disclosures made about these relationships. The 53-year old also conceded that ""he did not provide details of all relationships and accepts he was obligated to make more complete disclosure.""

Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss will replace Looney on an interim basis. London-listed shares in BP were lower in early trading on Wednesday.

The departure raises questions around BP's future strategy, which had largely centered around a push into green energy that was spearheaded by Looney. Executives have previously said that the business would continue to transition away from fossil fuels even as a spike in crude prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine boosted annual profits to record levels in 2022.

Following a dip in oil prices earlier this year, the main benchmarks are now sitting close to their highest marks since last November. By 05:23 ET, the futures traded 0.6% higher at $89.39 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.6% to $92.58."

According to Reuters, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made comments during a regular foreign ministry press briefing.

“Recently we did notice a lot of media exposure of security incidents related to Apple’s phones. The Chinese government attaches great importance to information and cyber security and treats both domestic and foreign companies as equals,” Mao Ning reportedly said.

The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported that China is mulling banning iPhone use by government officials. The country accounts for 19% of Apple’s total revenue."

FineWoven offers a subtle lustre and a soft, suedelike feel, and is available on iPhone MagSafe cases and wallets as well as the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle Apple Watch bands.

The company also introduced a new tool in the Home app called Grid Forecast, which helps inform users when their power grid has cleaner energy available, so they can decide when to use electricity.

""We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral -- and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, said in a statement.

According to the company, each carbon-neutral Apple Watch model meets the following strict criteria -- 100 per cent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 per cent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 per cent of shipping without the use of air transportation.

These combined efforts result in at least a 75 per cent reduction in product emissions for each model.

The tech giant is also accelerating progress toward plastic-free packaging by 2025.

In addition to achieving the first 100 per cent fibre-based packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup, the packaging for every iPhone 15 model is over 99 per cent fibre-based, said the company.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

“Precision dual-frequency GPS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou and NavIC),” read the tech specifications under the location category.

This is the first time the iPhone maker has extended support for NavIC to its iPhone models.

So far, GPS, owned by the US government, has been one of the most popular satellite-based navigation systems in India and the world.

India is now trying to push its own navigation system to reduce reliance on GPS and other systems.

Currently, some smartphone makers like Xiaomi, OnePlus and Realme already support NavIC on some of their phones.

India aims to expand NavIC coverage globally and it wants tech companies to make their devices compatible with the new standard before then.

To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, ISRO established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).

NavIC was erstwhile known as Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).

Currently there are eight first generation NavIC satellites in orbit. A senior ISRO official recently told IANS that out of the eight NavIC satellites in orbit, four are functional for navigation services and four others are messaging services.

In May, India successfully put into orbit the first of its second generation navigation satellite NVS-01.

NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1,500 km beyond Indian boundary, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

NavIC SPS signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou.

The company's new product launch failed to impress investors, resulting in a drop in share price. This development came amidst a choppy trading session as investors anticipated August's inflation data and the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of Arm, a Softbank-owned chipmaker.

The focus of Tuesday's trading was largely on expectations for Wednesday's release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI). Many experts anticipated an acceleration in headline CPI due to a surge in gas prices. However, the core CPI reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was projected to decline on an annual basis compared to July's figure.

""This is one of the last pieces of key economic data ahead of the Fed's rate decision and I think it would take a shockingly hot number to push the Fed to hike next week,"" said Michael Reinking, senior market strategist at the New York Stock Exchange. Futures traders were pricing in a 93% chance that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates unchanged at next week's meeting.

In other news, Arm, once a buyout target of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), stopped taking orders for its highly anticipated IPO a day ahead of schedule due to high demand. The Arm IPO is expected to be priced at a range of $47 to $51 per share, resulting in $5 billion in new capital for the company and a valuation of approximately $54.5 billion. However, David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, warned investors against this IPO as he believed the offering creates ""a valuation that is completely disconnected from the company’s fundamentals.""

Meanwhile, Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged 13.5% after the cloud software company reported higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings but fell short of revenue estimates. The company also forecast lower-than-anticipated fiscal Q2 results.

On Wednesday, September 13, 2022, major U.S. indices turned in weaker overnight as big tech stocks faltered despite little change in Treasury yields. The spotlight remained on the U.S. CPI data release, expected to show a resurgence in headline pricing pressures and further cooling in U.S. core inflation.

West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed on Wednesday after reaching a near 10-month high on Tuesday due to production cuts by OPEC+ leaders, contributing to projections for the tightest supply in a decade. This surge in oil prices sent energy shares higher and added to concerns about inflation.

In response to elevated inflation and increasing U.S. debt issuance, investors demanded higher yields during an auction of U.S. on Tuesday, leading to the highest yield since 2007. The two-year Treasury yields, more sensitive to imminent Federal Reserve moves, remained above 5%.

The dollar edged lower on Wednesday, while major currencies like the yen traded within narrow ranges. Swap traders are currently betting that the Federal Reserve will maintain its policy at a meeting next week and see approximately a 50% chance of a rate hike in November.

Asian markets took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, which closed lower overnight on a selldown in technology stocks before the inflation reading. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) also fell nearly 2% after unveiling a new range of iPhones, as its pricing for the range underwhelmed some investors hoping for a sizeable price bump.

Asian-listed Apple suppliers were a mixed bag, with AAC Technologies (HK: ) and Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ) losing 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, while SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively.

Camera module maker Sunny Optical Technology Group (HK: ) rose 3.4%, as Apple also announced a major camera upgrade for its new line of iPhones.

Broader Asian markets traded flat or lower, with Australia’s index leading regional losses with a 0.9% decline.

Japan’s fell 0.3%, as a Reuters poll showed that business confidence in the country’s largest firms declined in early-September, amid growing concerns over a slowdown in China, one of Japan’s biggest export markets.

Chinese stocks sink, but property stocks rally

China’s and indexes fell 0.6% each, while Hong Kong's shed 0.3%.

Sentiment towards China remained largely negative, as a swathe of economic indicators for August painted a weak picture of Asia’s largest economy. This was coupled with a slow rollout of more stimulus measures from Beijing.

But property stocks were among the few bright spots for the day. Beleaguered developer Country Garden Holdings (HK: ) rallied over 11% after it won approval from some bondholders to extend payments for three years, staving off fears of an imminent default.

Gains in Country Garden spilled over into other major players, with Sunac China (HK: ), Shimao Property (HK: ) and Longfor Properties Co Ltd (HK: ) up between 2% and 6%.

US CPI inflation, Fed meeting in focus

Markets were now focused largely on U.S. inflation data, due later in the day. The reading is expected to show that inflation accelerated in August from the prior month, amid increasing fuel prices and strong consumer spending.

Any increases in U.S. inflation give the Federal Reserve more impetus to hike interest rates, with the central bank next week. Rising rates bode poorly for risk-driven markets, and are likely to limit capital flows into Asia."

“That is below the $64 billion Arm owner SoftBank Group recently valued the company at when it bought out a stake held by its Vision Fund,” the report said.

The Japanese investment giant SoftBank acquired Arm for $31 billion in 2016.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

“So I guzzled my water, kept on going, said bye to Kathleen, and went to go get my AirPods. And my pills were in my hand. I swallowed my AirPods,"" she added.

This decision could pose significant challenges to America's bid to become a global leader in chip production by the end of the decade. The absence of a local packaging facility implies that chips manufactured at TSMC's $40 billion Arizona fab, due for completion in 2025, will have to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging.

The TSMC Arizona fab is a crucial part of President Joe Biden's plan to design and produce leading-edge logic chips, as reported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2022. However, construction on the fab has been delayed due to a shortage of skilled US workers. Despite this, the fab remains integral to US infrastructure and military modernization efforts.

Last December, Apple (NASDAQ: ) announced it would become the Arizona fab's biggest customer. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that these chips could be proudly stamped ""Made in America"". However, Dylan Patel, chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, argued that without a local packaging facility, the Arizona fab is effectively a paperweight and does not significantly contribute to America's advanced chip supplies.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) reported in 2021 that US semiconductor firms offshore almost all packaging processes, with only 46 facilities located domestically specializing in outsourced testing and assembly operations. Meanwhile, there are 107 such facilities in Taiwan and 111 in China—countries responsible for at least 81 percent of global chip assembly, packaging, and testing.

Apple hasn't specified how many chips it plans to purchase from the Arizona fab. The company might be planning to buy less advanced chips that could be packaged outside Taiwan for its iPads and MacBooks. However, more advanced chips used in the iPhone, Apple Watch, and advanced Mac desktops would still likely have to come from Taiwan.

TSMC employees told The Information that building a packaging facility in the US is unlikely due to high costs. Analysts also believe that the Arizona fab won't produce enough chips to justify TSMC building a packaging facility in the US. When fully operational, the fab will produce 600,000 wafers per year, a relatively small amount compared to the 15 million total wafers TSMC produced in 2022.

On Thursday, September 14, 2022, Dylan Patel reiterated his stance, stating that the TSMC Arizona fab will be little more than a paperweight in any geopolitical tension or war with China over Taiwan due to the need to send the chips back to Taiwan for packaging.

Despite this increase, energy prices are expected to remain range-bound in the near future. Core CPI, excluding volatile elements such as food and energy, saw a modest rise of 0.3%, a figure closely watched by Federal Reserve officials for assessing long-term inflation trajectory.

Apple said, in a statement, that iPhone 12 has been certified by several international regulators as compliant.

The tech giant, which just launched iPhone 15 series, said it has independent third-party lab results that show that it complies with all Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) standards globally.

Earlier, the ANFR released a public statement saying that the iPhone 12 breaches radiation levels, telling the company to temporarily halt iPhone 12 sales and release a fix.

""The French National Frequencies Agency (ANFR) is instructing Apple to withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market as of September 12, 2022, after the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) limit for this model was exceeded,"" the French agency said in a statement.

""ANFR enjoins Apple to implement all available means to rapidly remedy this malfunction. Failing this, Apple will be required to recall any units already sold,"" it added.

The most common EU SAR limit of 2 W/kg represents an average over 10 g of tissue absorbing the most signal, reports TechCrunch. This limit is a bit higher than the FCC limit in the U.S. (1.6 W/kg).

Apple complies with this SAR limit.

However, the ANFR measured an SAR of 5.74 W/kg, which is above the limit of 4 W/kg.

France’s junior minister for telecommunications, Jean-Noel Barrot, told Le Parisien that Apple has some time to comply with French regulations before further action.

""We have seen a definitive trend where Apple is now attracting many first-time users for its newly-launched iPhones in India, apart from a robust sale of previous-generation devices which continue to increase Apple’s overall market share in the country,"" Counterpoint Research Director Tarun Pathak told IANS.

Pathak said that the base iPhone 15 models will see a solid uptick in India as ""there is a significant upgrade for those shifting from previous iPhone 11, 12 and even 13-gen models"".

Apple set a June quarter record in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones, according to its CEO Tim Cook.

The tech giant opened its own-branded Mumbai and Delhi retail stores in the country in April this year, which met with great enthusiasm.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year and according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year, according to latest data.

Apple iPhone shipments grew 68 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of this year in the country.

In the first half, Apple secured a 6 per cent market share in the Indian smartphone market and dominated the super-premium smartphone segment (priced between Rs 50,000-Rs 100,000) with a robust 63 per cent market share, according to market intelligence firm CyberMedia Research (CMR).

For the first time, Apple will sell ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 on the first day of its global sales, within the country as well as export to a few other markets sooner than ever before, according to sources.

A small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is set to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global availability which is September 22.

There are estimates that the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter, which heralds the massive festive season in India, will hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Last year, the tech giant started assembling the iPhone 14 at the Foxconn facility in India in September, a first in years when a new iPhone was assembled within weeks of its global launch in the country.

This time, Apple has also extended support for the Indian satellite navigation system NavIC for its high-end iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max models for location-based services.

It, however, is yet to reveal what features will be part of the NavIC support in the country.

Apple continues to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in its direct-to-consumer offers in the country.

""If you look at it, it’s the second largest smartphone market in the world and we ought to be doing really well there and we are very pleased with our growth there,"" Cook said last month.

""We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,"" the Apple CEO added.

Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ: ) unveils incremental changes to its all-important iPhone device, while Arm reportedly gears up to price its initial public offering at the top end of its indicated range.

1. Futures edge lower ahead of key inflation data

U.S. stock futures inched lower on Wednesday, but stayed relatively close to the flatline, as traders awaited the release of crucial inflation figures later in the session that could help determine the path ahead for Federal Reserve monetary policy.

At 05:27 ET (09:27 GMT), the contract had slipped by 31 points or 0.1%, dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and fell marginally by 11 points or 0.1%.

All three of the main indices slumped in the prior session, with the in particular shedding 144 points or 1.0%. A drop in shares in business software group Oracle (NYSE: ) following a disappointing current-quarter revenue outlook, as well as a decline in Apple stock after the tech giant's annual fall hardware event, weighed on equity markets.

2. CPI seen accelerating in August

Attention now turns to the publication of the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), a major gauge of price gains, for August.

Fed officials and markets alike will likely be keeping a close eye on the data, which may impact how the central bank will approach interest rate decisions over the rest of the year.

Economists expect the pace of in the world's largest economy to have picked up to 3.6% during the month from 3.2% in July, while the CPI is projected to accelerate to 0.6% from 0.2%, due in large part to a recent uptick in energy prices.

The core reading, which strips out volatile items like food and fuel, is anticipated to have slowed from 4.7% to 4.3% . On a monthly basis, the is seen holding steady at 0.2%.

Corraling elevated inflation has been a major objective of the Fed's nearly year-and-a-half long campaign of interest rate hikes. Policymakers are widely tipped to skip further tightening at their upcoming meeting this month, but uncertainty still remains over what they may choose to do later on in 2022. Wednesday's CPI print may bring some clarity to the matter.

3. Apple's incremental hardware update

Shares in Apple dipped on Tuesday after the tech giant revealed four new iPhone models at its annual hardware refresher, but refrained from launching major updates to the flagship device's design or software.

One of the most notable revisions to the latest iPhone 15 gadget is the first-ever inclusion of a universal USB-C charging port. Apple was under pressure to build in the feature in order to comply with European Union law that sets a common charging standard for all smartphones and portable electronic devices.

Pricing, meanwhile, remained at broadly the same levels as last year, although the cost of the iPhone 15 Pro Max was effectively bumped up $100 to $1,199 as Apple attempts to extract more money out of the top-of-the-line model.

The world's most valuable company has been moving to stem a slide in revenues in the last three quarters that has been linked to a slowdown in the global smartphone market. Concerns are also rising around Apple's demand and production in China following reports that government officials have been asked not to use iPhones for work. Meanwhile, Chinese rival Huawei has unveiled its own updated smartphone, threatening the California group's market share in the country.

4. Final pricing of Arm IPO expected - Reuters

Arm has reportedly secured enough investor backing to at least price its much-anticipated initial public offering (IPO) at the top end of its indicated range, giving the British chip designer a fully diluted valuation of $54.5 billion.

According to a source quoted by Reuters, Arm chose to accept only the top end of its target band of $47 to $51 a share -- or an even higher price -- after reviewing a round of investor commitments. The company will decide how much it wants to sell its shares on Wednesday, Reuters said, citing the unnamed person and a second source.

Shares in Arm are currently set to begin trading in New York on Thursday.

Arm's IPO is expected to be the largest in almost two years. Strong demand for the flotation may also add fuel to the resurgent market for listings in the U.S., which had gone relatively dormant as firms shelved plans to go public due to worries over uncertain economic conditions. This week, e-commerce group Instacart, marketing automation company Klaviyo, and sandal maker Birkenstock have all teed up their own IPO plans.

5. Looney steps down as BP chief

Bernard Looney has resigned as Chief Executive Officer of BP (LON: ) (NYSE: ) over a failure to disclose all details surrounding his personal relationships with internal colleagues, the oil major announced.

In a statement, BP said Looney admitted that he was ""not fully transparent"" in prior disclosures made about these relationships. The 53-year old also conceded that ""he did not provide details of all relationships and accepts he was obligated to make more complete disclosure.""

Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss will replace Looney on an interim basis. London-listed shares in BP were lower in early trading on Wednesday.

The departure raises questions around BP's future strategy, which had largely centered around a push into green energy that was spearheaded by Looney. Executives have previously said that the business would continue to transition away from fossil fuels even as a spike in crude prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine boosted annual profits to record levels in 2022.

Following a dip in oil prices earlier this year, the main benchmarks are now sitting close to their highest marks since last November. By 05:23 ET, the futures traded 0.6% higher at $89.39 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.6% to $92.58."

According to Reuters, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made comments during a regular foreign ministry press briefing.

“Recently we did notice a lot of media exposure of security incidents related to Apple’s phones. The Chinese government attaches great importance to information and cyber security and treats both domestic and foreign companies as equals,” Mao Ning reportedly said.

FineWoven offers a subtle lustre and a soft, suedelike feel, and is available on iPhone MagSafe cases and wallets as well as the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle Apple Watch bands.

The company also introduced a new tool in the Home app called Grid Forecast, which helps inform users when their power grid has cleaner energy available, so they can decide when to use electricity.

""We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral -- and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, said in a statement.

According to the company, each carbon-neutral Apple Watch model meets the following strict criteria -- 100 per cent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 per cent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 per cent of shipping without the use of air transportation.

These combined efforts result in at least a 75 per cent reduction in product emissions for each model.

The tech giant is also accelerating progress toward plastic-free packaging by 2025.

In addition to achieving the first 100 per cent fibre-based packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup, the packaging for every iPhone 15 model is over 99 per cent fibre-based, said the company.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050 -- which will necessitate advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

“Precision dual-frequency GPS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou and NavIC),” read the tech specifications under the location category.

This is the first time the iPhone maker has extended support for NavIC to its iPhone models.

So far, GPS, owned by the US government, has been one of the most popular satellite-based navigation systems in India and the world.

India is now trying to push its own navigation system to reduce reliance on GPS and other systems.

Currently, some smartphone makers like Xiaomi, OnePlus and Realme already support NavIC on some of their phones.

India aims to expand NavIC coverage globally and it wants tech companies to make their devices compatible with the new standard before then.

To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, ISRO established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC).

NavIC was erstwhile known as Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).

Currently there are eight first generation NavIC satellites in orbit. A senior ISRO official recently told IANS that out of the eight NavIC satellites in orbit, four are functional for navigation services and four others are messaging services.

In May, India successfully put into orbit the first of its second generation navigation satellite NVS-01.

NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1,500 km beyond Indian boundary, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

NavIC SPS signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou.

The company's new product launch failed to impress investors, resulting in a drop in share price. This development came amidst a choppy trading session as investors anticipated August's inflation data and the upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of Arm, a Softbank-owned chipmaker.

The focus of Tuesday's trading was largely on expectations for Wednesday's release of the August Consumer Price Index (CPI). Many experts anticipated an acceleration in headline CPI due to a surge in gas prices. However, the core CPI reading, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was projected to decline on an annual basis compared to July's figure.

""This is one of the last pieces of key economic data ahead of the Fed's rate decision and I think it would take a shockingly hot number to push the Fed to hike next week,"" said Michael Reinking, senior market strategist at the New York Stock Exchange. Futures traders were pricing in a 93% chance that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates unchanged at next week's meeting.

In other news, Arm, once a buyout target of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), stopped taking orders for its highly anticipated IPO a day ahead of schedule due to high demand. The Arm IPO is expected to be priced at a range of $47 to $51 per share, resulting in $5 billion in new capital for the company and a valuation of approximately $54.5 billion. However, David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs, warned investors against this IPO as he believed the offering creates ""a valuation that is completely disconnected from the company’s fundamentals.""

Meanwhile, Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged 13.5% after the cloud software company reported higher-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings but fell short of revenue estimates. The company also forecast lower-than-anticipated fiscal Q2 results.

The fluctuation comes ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data for August, which is expected to provide insights into the future path of Federal Reserve interest rates.

On Tuesday, a rout in technology companies dragged down the U.S. stock market. The slid 1.1%, while Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., which unveiled the iPhone 15 and other products, dropped almost 2%. The also fell by 0.6%.

Oil traded near a 10-month high amid strains in global supplies. West Texas Intermediate crude was little changed on Wednesday after reaching a near 10-month high on Tuesday due to production cuts by OPEC+ leaders, contributing to projections for the tightest supply in a decade. This surge in oil prices sent energy shares higher and added to concerns about inflation.

In response to elevated inflation and increasing U.S. debt issuance, investors demanded higher yields during an auction of U.S. on Tuesday, leading to the highest yield since 2007. The two-year Treasury yields, more sensitive to imminent Federal Reserve moves, remained above 5%.

The dollar edged lower on Wednesday, while major currencies like the yen traded within narrow ranges. Swap traders are currently betting that the Federal Reserve will maintain its policy at a meeting next week and see approximately a 50% chance of a rate hike in November.

This shift in expectations has led to a significant change in investors' equity allocation - a rush towards U.S. equities and an exodus from emerging markets, as revealed by Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ).'s latest global fund manager survey. Emerging markets equity allocation fell to a net 9% overweight in September from 34%, marking its lowest reading since November 2022.

Asian markets took a weak lead-in from Wall Street, which closed lower overnight on a selldown in technology stocks before the inflation reading. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) also fell nearly 2% after unveiling a new range of iPhones, as its pricing for the range underwhelmed some investors hoping for a sizeable price bump.

Asian-listed Apple suppliers were a mixed bag, with AAC Technologies (HK: ) and Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ) losing 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, while SK Hynix Inc (KS: ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively.

Camera module maker Sunny Optical Technology Group (HK: ) rose 3.4%, as Apple also announced a major camera upgrade for its new line of iPhones.

Broader Asian markets traded flat or lower, with Australia’s index leading regional losses with a 0.9% decline.

Japan’s fell 0.3%, as a Reuters poll showed that business confidence in the country’s largest firms declined in early-September, amid growing concerns over a slowdown in China, one of Japan’s biggest export markets.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a strong open as data on Tuesday showed grew less than expected in August. The Nifty was also trading close to record highs, amid increasing optimism over the South Asian economy.

Chinese stocks sink, but property stocks rally

China’s and indexes fell 0.6% each, while Hong Kong's shed 0.3%.

Sentiment towards China remained largely negative, as a swathe of economic indicators for August painted a weak picture of Asia’s largest economy. This was coupled with a slow rollout of more stimulus measures from Beijing.

But property stocks were among the few bright spots for the day. Beleaguered developer Country Garden Holdings (HK: ) rallied over 11% after it won approval from some bondholders to extend payments for three years, staving off fears of an imminent default.

Gains in Country Garden spilled over into other major players, with Sunac China (HK: ), Shimao Property (HK: ) and Longfor Properties Co Ltd (HK: ) up between 2% and 6%.

US CPI inflation, Fed meeting in focus

Markets were now focused largely on U.S. inflation data, due later in the day. The reading is expected to show that inflation accelerated in August from the prior month, amid increasing fuel prices and strong consumer spending.

Any increases in U.S. inflation give the Federal Reserve more impetus to hike interest rates, with the central bank next week. Rising rates bode poorly for risk-driven markets, and are likely to limit capital flows into Asia."

The elegant experience fluidly expands and adapts so users can see the next direction in Maps; easily control music; and, with third-party app integrations, get real-time updates on food delivery, ride sharing, sports scores, travel plans, and more. The Super Retina XDR® display is great for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+℠ workouts, and playing games. Peak HDR brightness now reaches up to 1600 nits so HDR photos and videos look better than ever. And when it is sunny, peak outdoor brightness reaches up to 2000 nits — twice as bright as the previous generation.

Both models feature a sophisticated new look that’s built to last. For the first time in a smartphone, color is infused throughout the back glass, creating five beautiful colors. The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure feels even nicer in users’ hands, and the Ceramic Shield® front cover continues to be tougher than any other smartphone glass. With a water- and dust-resistant design2 and industry-leading durability features, iPhone lasts and holds its value longer than any other smartphone. Plus, the internal design provides powerful sustained performance, while improving ease and affordability of repairs.

A Powerful Camera to Capture Every Moment in Super-High Resolution

The advanced camera system on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus helps users capture everyday moments and cherished memories. A 48MP Main camera shoots sharp photos and videos while capturing fine details, with a quad-pixel sensor and 100 percent Focus Pixels for fast autofocus. Using the power of computational photography, the Main camera gives users a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad®, or Mac®. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Shooting at night gets better with improvements to Night mode, including sharper details and more vivid colors. When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth® front camera.

A16 Bionic: Proven, Powerful Performance

The fast and efficient A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering extraordinary battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games. A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences — all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave.

Better for the Environment

iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus now use even more recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine®, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe — all firsts for iPhone. Both models also include 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB-C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The iPhone 15 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.

To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Apple unveils Apple Watch Ultra 2,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-apple-watch-ultra-2-432SI-3806586,"Apple® today introduced Apple Watch Ultra™ 2, bringing new features to Apple’s most capable and rugged smartwatch, and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers all of the features users love about Ultra, plus the powerful new S9 SiP, a magical new double tap gesture, Apple’s brightest display ever, expanded altitude range, on-device Siri®, Precision Finding for iPhone®, and advanced capabilities for water adventures. Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS® 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new cycling experiences, features to help explore the outdoors, and a new watch face — Modular Ultra. With all the new advancements, Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the same 36-hour battery life with regular use and up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode.

For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch®, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.

“This year we’ve made our most rugged and capable Apple Watch even better,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Ultra 2 is our most advanced Apple Watch, with great performance and feature updates. It’s perfect for anyone who wants our biggest, brightest display, longest battery life, and best GPS of any Apple Watch, all in a stunning design.”

Powerful New S9 SiP

Apple Watch Ultra 2 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast as the original Apple Watch Ultra.

Double Tap Gesture

Innovations such as the Digital Crown® and Taptic Engine® — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.

Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch, or even switch to the new Elevation view in the Compass app to see the relative elevation of saved waypoints.

The new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Ultra 2, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.

Brighter Display

A new advanced display architecture pushes the maximum brightness of Apple Watch Ultra 2 to 3000 nits — 50 percent brighter than the first generation of Apple Watch Ultra and the brightest display Apple has ever designed — for greater readability in harsh sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. Flashlight also benefits from the new display architecture; rotating the Digital Crown temporarily doubles the brightness to better light the way.

Modular Ultra Watch Face

A new watch face designed for Apple Watch Ultra — Modular Ultra — takes advantage of the large display, using the outermost edge to present real-time data, including seconds, altitude, or depth. It offers the most complications of any Apple digital watch face to customize for sports, outdoor adventures, and ocean and water activities.

Tested for Extremes

Apple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for extremes and has been tested for use across the largest range of altitudes for any Apple product, from 500 meters below sea level to explore the lowest valleys, and up to 9,000 meters to ascend the world’s tallest peaks.

Recreational Scuba Diving and Freediving

Apple Watch Ultra is perfect for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters — and now freediving — with the updated Oceanic+ app from Huish Outdoors.1

The built-in Depth app now saves a log of each session so users can review the most recent sessions on Apple Watch Ultra or view the complete history of all dives with a GPS entry point in the Fitness app on iPhone.

During a freedive with the Oceanic+ app, users will see critical data like depth and elapsed time, and receive target depth alerts, all in big, bold, glanceable text. Between dives, heart rate zones help users monitor and lower their heart rate, and preset alarms like surface time and elapsed session time guide users through each training session. The detailed logbook provides a full profile, including descent and ascent speeds.

On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data

For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, like starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate.

On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, to start an outdoor run or cycling workout, or make requests like setting a waypoint with just their voice, even with no connectivity. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Ultra 2 to log health data such as their weight, body temperature, period, or medications taken.2

Precision Finding

The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it’s in a different room or a user doesn’t remember where it’s been stowed after a dive, for example.

Featuring watchOS 10

Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS 10, a milestone update that includes:

A fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps and a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed.

Delightful new watch faces in addition to the new Modular Ultra face: Snoopy, Palette, Solar Analog, and Nike Globe.

Night Mode now uses the ambient light sensor to automatically activate in the dark.

Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrives for cyclists, unlocking new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts. Power Zones help users get the most out of training.

Cycling workouts can automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and can utilize the full screen when tapped.

The updated Compass app displays current elevation in real time and includes a 3D view of waypoints showing relative elevation.

New topographic maps in the Maps app show important details like points of interest and trailheads, and provide helpful details such as hill shading, contour lines, elevation, and cellular and Emergency SOS waypoints.

Additional tools to support mental health with state of mind logging in the Mindfulness app.

The ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia.

Carbon Neutral Models

Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch SE®, and the new Apple Watch Series 9 are Apple’s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch Ultra 2 paired with an Alpine Loop or Trail Loop features 95 percent recycled titanium, compared with no recycled titanium in the first Apple Watch Ultra.3 A new logo on Apple Watch Ultra 2 packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Apple unveils its first carbon neutral products,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-its-first-carbon-neutral-products-432SI-3806579,"Apple® today announced its first-ever carbon neutral products in the all-new Apple Watch® lineup. Innovations in design and clean energy have driven dramatic reductions in product emissions of over 75 percent for each carbon neutral Apple Watch.1 This milestone marks a major step in the company’s journey toward its ambitious Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral by the end of the decade, including the entire global supply chain and the lifetime use of every device Apple makes.

As part of Apple 2030 and the company’s broader environmental efforts, Apple has also ended the use of leather across all of its product lines, announced its first entirely fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch lineup,2 and continued to expand the use of recycled materials in iPhone®. The company also introduced a new tool in the Home app called Grid Forecast,3 which helps inform users when their power grid has cleaner energy available, so they can decide when to use electricity.

“At Apple, we have a longstanding and proven commitment to leading the fight against climate change. Our focus on renewable energy and low-carbon design has already driven industry-leading emissions reductions, and we’re not slowing down,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral — and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment.”

Every Product Carbon Neutral by 2030

Apple has adopted a clear and rigorous approach to product decarbonization that prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the three biggest sources across the product life cycle: electricity, materials, and transportation. Only after Apple steeply cuts product emissions, will the company apply high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects for emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced with existing solutions.

Each carbon neutral Apple Watch model meets the following strict criteria: 100 percent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 percent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 percent of shipping without the use of air transportation.4 These combined efforts result in at least a 75 percent reduction in product emissions for each model. The company will use high-quality carbon credits to address the small amount of remaining emissions, resulting in a carbon neutral product footprint. Every carbon neutral Apple Watch — which includes any aluminum Series 9 and SE models when paired with a new Sport Loop, and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2 when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop — is certified by SCS Global Services, a leader in environmental standards and certification.

The Path to 2030

Apple’s first carbon neutral products are the result of years of significant work and innovation across the company and its global supply chain. They also represent the latest step on a journey that began over a decade ago.

In 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality for its global corporate operations and announced Apple 2030: a bold strategy to be carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. Apple’s plan centers on an aggressive 75 percent reduction in overall carbon emissions from 2015 levels. By avoiding activities that generate carbon, significantly expanding renewable energy across the company’s corporate operations and supply chain, and designing with recycled and renewable materials, Apple has so far reduced total emissions by over 45 percent since 2015, while still growing revenue by over 65 percent in the same period.

As Apple accelerates efforts to decarbonize its value chain, every product represents an opportunity to reduce emissions — from the electricity used for manufacturing and charging devices, to materials and shipping.

Spurring Progress in Clean Electricity

All manufacturing for the carbon neutral Apple Watch models is powered by 100 percent clean electricity through investments and sourcing by Apple and its suppliers. Additionally, every supplier that manufactures parts and components for these models has committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for all of their Apple production by the end of the decade. Apple also works with manufacturing partners around the world to advocate for policies that support wider deployment of clean energy solutions.

Apple began building and investing in large-scale solar and wind farms to power its data centers and offices over a decade ago. In 2015, the company started working with its manufacturing partners to help them create and invest in their own solar and wind projects, and source renewable energy for all Apple production. Since 2018, all of Apple’s corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores worldwide have been powered by renewable electricity.

Thanks to these combined efforts, Apple and its global suppliers support more than 15 gigawatts of clean energy around the world today — enough to power over 5 million American homes. Across all product lines, more than 300 global suppliers — representing over 90 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — have now joined Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, committing to 100 percent renewable electricity for all Apple production by the end of this decade.

Electricity for manufacturing and charging devices represents the largest source of Apple’s emissions across all product lines. To address the latter, Apple has committed to invest in large-scale solar and wind projects around the world. For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the company will match 100 percent of customers’ expected electricity use for charging.

Innovating in Low-Carbon Design

Apple has pioneered the use of many key recycled materials in its products through world-class product engineering, extensive design qualification, and supply chain expertise. The new products announced today build on these achievements.

To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple is ending the use of leather across all of its product lines, including iPhone accessories and Apple Watch bands. The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content. FineWoven offers a subtle luster and a soft, suedelike feel, and is available on iPhone MagSafe® cases and wallets as well as the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle Apple Watch bands.

As recycled and renewable materials often have a lower carbon footprint than primary materials, Apple’s industry-leading progress in the use of recycled content also advances the company’s Apple 2030 goal. The new FineWoven material has significantly lower emissions compared to the more carbon-intensive leather, and both the new iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch lineups advance progress toward the company’s 2025 targets for the use of 100 percent recycled metals in key components. This includes 100 percent recycled rare earth magnets and the company’s first use of 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery of iPhone 15, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.5 Additionally, the popular Sport Loop has been redesigned with 82 percent recycled yarn, which includes material from discarded fishing nets. Customers looking to upgrade to the new carbon neutral Apple Watch models can take advantage of Apple Trade In, and Apple will refurbish the device for a new owner, or recycle it for free.

Apple is also accelerating progress toward plastic-free packaging by 2025. In addition to achieving the first 100 percent fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup, the packaging for every iPhone 15 model is over 99 percent fiber-based.

Reducing Transportation Emissions

Transporting products around the world makes up about 9 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint. The company is shifting more product volume to shipping modes that are less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as ocean or rail. Apple’s carbon footprint methodology shows that shipping the same product by ocean emits 95 percent fewer emissions than by air.

For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, including watches and bands, the company will ship at least 50 percent of the combined weight using non-air modes, cutting total transportation emissions nearly in half. Additionally, the packaging of all Apple Watch Series 9 and SE models has been redesigned for compactness, with a new, smaller shape that allows for 25 percent more devices per shipment.

At the same time, Apple is committed to supporting broader efforts to decarbonize shipping industries, such as by being a member of the First Movers Coalition, and by supporting analysis to identify pathways for developing sustainable aviation fuels. The company also seeks out technical innovations — including the use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles — and selects vendors that offer low-carbon options to help further drive decarbonization in the industry.

Investing in High-Quality Carbon Removal

After achieving steep reductions in product emissions, Apple plans to cover residual emissions with high-quality carbon credits primarily from nature-based projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, like restoring grasslands, wetlands, and forests. Carbon removal is critical to addressing climate change and achieving global climate goals, as leading scientific bodies like the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have emphasized.

Apple defines high-quality credits as those from projects that are real, additional, measurable, and quantified, with systems in place to avoid double-counting, and that ensure permanence. Apple has helped advance natural carbon-removal solutions that meet this definition by creating the innovative Restore Fund, which currently supports projects in Latin America. The company uses credits from projects that are certified to international standards such as Verra; the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards; and the Forest Stewardship Council.

For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the high-quality carbon credits used to compensate for the remaining emissions will come from projects like the Restore Fund’s investments with Arbaro Advisors and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, which are helping to restore and protect high-quality working forests and native ecosystems in Paraguay and Brazil.

Introducing Grid Forecast

As Apple decarbonizes its value chain, the company is also committed to engaging with customers and creating technology that helps them understand and address their environmental impact.

Grid Forecast is a new tool in the Home app on Apple devices that shows when a user’s electrical grid has relatively cleaner or less clean energy sources available. For example, there are times when wind and solar projects produce more energy than the grid can use, leading to some of it being wasted. There are also times when electricity is being generated with lower emissions. By using electricity during these cleaner times, customers may lower the climate impact of the electricity they use at home.

Apple uses data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information into one, easy-to-follow signal. This can help people make decisions about the best time to run large appliances and charge electric vehicles or devices throughout the day. In the contiguous United States, Grid Forecast is available in the Home app on iPhone, iPad®, Mac®, and Apple Watch, and can be added as an iOS widget or a watch face complication. As additional data becomes available through ongoing industry collaboration, Apple will continue refining Grid Forecast to maximize impact.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 — which requires advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

Footnotes

1Carbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: No use of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond what is already available on the grid; Apple’s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015; and Apple’s average mix of transportation modes by product line across three years.

2The breakdown of U.S. retail packaging is by weight. Adhesives, inks, and coatings are excluded from calculations of plastic content and packaging weight.

3Grid Forecast will be available in the contiguous United States.

450 percent or more of all carbon neutral products by total weight are planned, as of product launch, to be shipped using non-air modes of transportation — like ocean freight — from the factory to their next destination over the lifetime of the products.

Powerful New S9 SiP

Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life.1

Double Tap Gesture

Innovations such as the Digital Crown® and Taptic Engine® — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9.

Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.

This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.

Brighter Display

The power-efficient S9 SiP and advanced display architecture increase the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display up to 2000 nits — double that of Series 8 — making it even easier to read text in bright sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by.

On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data

For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate than Apple Watch Series 8.

On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, or about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as their weight, period, or medications taken.2

Precision Finding and HomePod Integration

The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room.

UWB also brings deeper integration between Apple Watch and HomePod®. When an Apple Watch user gets within 4 meters of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media. Or if nothing is playing on HomePod, media suggestions will appear at the top of the Smart Stack.

Carbon Neutral Models

Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra™ 2, and Apple Watch SE® are Apple’s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch packaging has been redesigned to be 100 percent fiber-based, and a new logo on the packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.

Apple Watch SE

Apple Watch SE continues to deliver the core Apple Watch experience at a more affordable price point, and is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, use with Family Setup, or gift to their loved ones. Additionally, Apple Watch SE offers Activity tracking, high and low heart rate notifications, Fall Detection, Emergency SOS, Crash Detection, and watchOS 10.

Lineup

Apple Watch Series 9 is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes in starlight, midnight, silver, (PRODUCT)RED, and a new pink aluminum case, as well as stainless steel in gold, silver, and graphite cases.

Any aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 with a new Sport Loop band is carbon neutral.

Apple Watch SE is available in 40mm and 44mm aluminum cases, and is carbon neutral when paired with a new Sport Loop band.

Apple Watch Hermès is available in stainless steel in silver and space black.

Bands

Apple is introducing FineWoven, a luxurious and durable microtwill made of 68 percent post-consumer recycled content that has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather. FineWoven has a suedelike feel, and is available with the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle bands. Starting today, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple product, including watch bands.

The popular Sport Loop band has been redesigned to include 82 percent recycled yarn. All new Apple Watch Sport Loops are carbon neutral.

Apple worked with Nike and Hermès on more environmentally friendly band collections. The Nike Sport Band now contains 32 percent or more recycled fluoroelastomer, including colorful flakes made from excess bands that create a randomized pattern, making each band unique, while the Nike Sport Loop with a space-dye pattern repurposes yarn from previous seasons.

A new collection of Hermès bands draws on the house’s rich history in textiles and craftsmanship. Two new woven bands are introduced: Toile H is an interpretation of the brand’s signature checked canvas, and Twill Jump is a rich solid color with contrasting details. The first-ever knitted band for Apple Watch, Bridon, is hand-braided with a bold chevron pattern, while Kilim is made of sporty, waterproof molded rubber and has a deployment buckle. A classic new watch face, Hermès Radial, complements these four new band styles.3

According to MacRumors, clicking the like button pushes the logo to spread into pieces, before changing back into the typical love heart. The brief animation mimics the Apple logo graphics used to promote the Apple event -- multi-coloured metallic Apple logos -- possibly a reference to the titanium frame on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro.

The colours used in the Apple logo also match the colours expected for the iPhone 15 Pro, including silver, grey, black, and dark blue, the report said.

A number of users also shared the development on X. ""Is the #AppleEvent animation working for you too,"" a user wrote.

""The #AppleEvent hashtag has implemented an animation for the like button,"" another user said. One more user stated, ""The #AppleEvent has changed the like button. Tap the button twice to see it"".

Three years ago, Apple began using Twitter ""like"" animations to promote its events, with the first use being for the September 2020 ""Time Flies"" event.

The ""Wonderlust"" event also features a custom Twitter hashtag with Apple's logo, just like WWDC in June.

At the event, the iPhone 15 is expected to be the most significant update to the device in three years. It will include camera system upgrades across the range, with the Pro models getting an improved 3-nanometer processor.

iPhone 15 is also expected to feature USB-C type for the first time. Introducing a USB-C charging cable point in iPhone 15 is set to herald a new era for Apple.

2022-09-12, IANS,Apple gears up to sell ‘Make in India’ iPhones on 1st day of global sale,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-gears-up-to-sell-make-in-india-iphones-on-1st-day-of-global-sale-3805954,"New Delhi, Sep 12 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is all set to sell ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 on the first day of its global sales, within the country as well as export to a few other markets sooner than ever before, reliable sources said on Tuesday.People close to the matter told IANS that India-made iPhone 15 will be available on the first day of its global sale.

The new iPhone 15 series was likely to go on sale in the days or weeks following the launch on Tuesday (US time).

According to sources, a small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is set to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

In August, Apple maker Foxconn geared up the local production of the next-generation iPhone 15 at its Sriperumbudur facility near Tamil Nadu (NS: ) faster than ever, as the company doubled down on the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Sources close to the development had told IANS that Apple aims to deliver locally-assembled iPhone 15 as soon as it is launched globally in the middle of next month, in order to narrow the launch-to-availability gap and increase its exports from India to other nations.

Last year, Apple started assembling the iPhone 14 at the Foxconn facility in India in September, a first in years when a new iPhone was assembled within weeks of its global launch in the country.

The iPhone 15 is expected to be the most significant update to the device in three years. It will include camera system upgrades across the range, with the Pro models getting an improved 3-nanometer processor.

iPhone 15 is also expected to feature USB-C type for the first time. Introducing a USB-C charging cable point in iPhone 15 is set to herald a new era for Apple.

Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year.

The market momentum for iPhones in India has been driven by the sales of the previous-generation iPhones.

By 06:50 ET (10:50 GMT), the contract was down 60 points, or 0.2%, traded 11 points, or 0.3%, lower and dropped 35 points, or 0.2%.

The three major Wall Street indices closed higher Monday, with the tech-heavy leading the way, gaining 1.1%, as Tesla (NASDAQ: ) surged on optimism around artificial intelligence. The blue-chip ended 0.3% higher and the broad-based rose 0.7%.

Weak Oracle guidance weighs

This positive tone has disappeared Tuesday, after Oracle (NYSE: ) offered up disappointing current-quarter revenue guidance after the close Monday as a tough economy pressured cloud spending by businesses.

The computer software company forecast second-quarter revenue growth of between 5% and 7%, lower than analysts' average estimate of 8.2%, causing its stock to slump over 9% premarket.

After a surge in cloud demand during the pandemic, businesses are rethinking their digitization plans, hurting Oracle as it plays catch-up in a segment dominated by larger rivals.

Apple’s “Wonderlust” eyed for iPhone news

Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight as the world’s most valuable company hosts its annual fall hardware update in California later in the session, dubbed “Wonderlust” this year.

The tech giant is widely expected to unveil its new iPhone 15, complete with new features and perhaps a slightly higher price on the Pro models than the previous model.

Despite a dip in iPhone revenues in Apple's most recent quarter, the smartphone remains massively important, making up about half of the firm's total sales.

Tuesday’s economic data slate largely consists of the reading for August, which deteriorated slightly to 91.3 from July’s 91.9. This was the index's first fall in four months.

Elsewhere, British chip designer Arm will reportedly stop taking orders for its much-anticipated initial public offering a day early due to solid investor demand, while Disney and Charter Communications reach a distribution deal to end a TV blackout that threatened to leave millions of households unable to tune in to the first ""Monday Night Football"" game of the season.

1. Futures slip after positive day on Wall Street

U.S. stock futures fell on Tuesday, pointing to a lower open after a positive day on Wall Street that featured a surge in shares of electric carmaker Tesla.

At 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT), the contract had shed 56 points or 0.2%, lost 11 points or 0.2%, and dipped by 42 points or 0.3%.

The three main indices rose on Monday. Fueling the upticks were Tesla shares, which gained more than 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) suggested that the company's Dojo supercomputer could give it access to new opportunities beyond ""selling cars at a fixed price."" The analysts added that the Elon Musk-led business may see its market value jump by $600 billion thanks to the technology.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) also announced that it had extended a deal to supply 5G chips to Apple (NASDAQ: ) until 2026, sending shares in the U.S. semiconductor designer higher by almost 4%.

Looming in the background for equity markets is a slate of major U.S. economic data this week that includes a fresh look at inflation and retail prices. The figures will likely inform whether the Federal Reserve chooses to push on with an aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign later this year.

2. Arm to close IPO order book a day early - reports

Strong demand for chip designer Arm's initial public offering has pushed the banks underwriting the highly-anticipated listing to stop taking orders a day earlier than originally planned, according to various media reports.

Sources familiar with the matter told the Financial Times and Bloomberg News that the order book will close by Tuesday afternoon, with the reports suggesting that the IPO is already anywhere from over five to 10 times oversubscribed. Arm declined to comment to both news outlets.

Arm still reportedly intends to price its shares on Wednesday, with the figure potentially near the top end of -- or even higher than -- its initial range of $47 to $51. At the top end of this band, the company's fully diluted market value could touch $54.5B.

The reports would suggest that investors are widely unperturbed by a fall in Arm's profits over the last quarter or the firm's warning that it is ""susceptible"" to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.



3. Apple expected to unveil new iPhone model

Apple is set to announce the latest version of its flagship iPhone at its annual fall hardware update in California later today.

The event will feature four new models of the ubiquitous device, according to sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ added that the gadgets, which are expected to be called the iPhone 15, will include two base models and two higher-priced advanced versions.

Despite a dip in iPhone revenues in Apple's most recent quarter, the smartphone remains massively important, making up about half of the group's total sales.

But the iPhone may be facing looming headwinds. Along with a slump in the global smartphone market, reports last week said that China has ordered government officials to stop using iPhones for work, stoking concerns over the gadget's future in the country. Analysts have also flagged that a new device from Huawei could threaten Apple's hold on China's market for high-end smartphones.

4. Oil prices move higher



Oil prices rose Tuesday, with futures holding above $90 a barrel, as markets awaiting the release of the OPEC oil producer group's monthly report later in the session.

Traders are particularly on the lookout for OPEC's forecasts for China's oil market, as expectations that the country will drive demand to record highs this year dwindle. Industry data on stocks from the American Petroleum Institute are also due later today, and are expected to continue a recent run of draws.

By 05:54 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $87.96 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $91.21. Last week, Brent touched a level above $90 a barrel for the first time in 10 months on news that Saudi Arabia and Russia had extended their voluntary supply cuts until the end of the year.

5. Disney and Charter reach deal to end ESPN, ABC blackout

Shares in Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ: ) were higher in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday after the two companies forged a distribution deal that ended a blackout of popular channels like ESPN and ABC.

Under the terms of the agreement, Disney will give select subscribers to Charter's pay-TV service Spectrum access to its advertising-supported Disney+ streaming offering. ESPN+, the entertainment giant's sports-based streaming service, will also be made available to Spectrum customers with more premium subscriptions. Charter will pay Disney higher rates to carry its TV channels in return.

The deal, which was announced on Monday, came just hours before a highly-touted National Football League game between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills was due to be televised on ESPN. Millions of households may not have been able to watch the match-up if an agreement had not been reached.

The stand-off between Charter and Disney was largely seen as an example of the strained relations between pay-TV firms and entertainment companies during an era of increasing demand for streaming services. In a joint statement, both companies hailed the agreement as ""transformative"" and an ""innovative model for the future."""

The world’s largest iPhone factory is “continuing to expand its workforce ahead of the release of the iPhone 15, with Apple hoping to avoid last year’s supply chain woes at the plant in China,” the report said.

The new workers are expected to help the factory meet demand for Apple’s new products, including iPhone 15.

“The iPhone 15 from Apple is expected to keep sales strong throughout the year and maintain its dominance in the above $600 price range in China,” Counterpoint Research senior analyst Ivan Lam was quoted as saying.

Foxconn offered larger bonuses to returning workers in June this year following a worker exodus and production disruptions.

The iPhone 15 is coming to China amid a new set of challenges, as the country banned iPhone use for certain government officials in the country, creating a chain of reaction that saw Apple stock losing billions.

Beijing instructed some government staff to stop using iPhones through chat groups or meetings, according to an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.

Apple relies heavily on Greater China region for both manufacturing and sales of its iPhones and has a major chunk of its product manufacturing in the country amid its future plans to make India the next big manufacturing hub.

Meanwhile, Huawei launched the foldable Mate X5 and the Mate 60 Pro+ last week, following the launch of the 5G capable Mate 60 Pro last month, with a powerful chip despite tough US restrictions.

The new generation of iPhones were set to be revealed on Tuesday (US time).

Although reports claim that the USB-C port will be available on all iPhone 15 models, famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that only the Pro and Pro Max will benefit from faster data transfer rates.

Both premium models will have ""at least"" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will have USB 2.0 ports.

Some Apple iPhone 15 models are likely to support charging up to 35W which will offer faster charging speeds.

Apple shifting to USB-C comes as the European Commission has made a move by passing a resolution that all smartphone makers will be required to support USB-C as a single charging standard for all mobile devices across the EU nations by 2024.

In India, nine in 10 Indian consumers want the government to drive standardisation of charging cables on priority as it will reduce inconvenience and make charging cables more affordable, according to community social media platform LocalCircles.

Most consumers now demand that the government should create common standards for USB charging cables like the EU as they believe standardisation will drive prices lower and make original charging cables more affordable.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced the standardisation of charging cables as the Type-C chord for various electronic devices like mobile phones, laptops, notebooks, and more.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) published standards for USB Type C receptacles, plug and cables, which is aimed at providing common charging solutions for the smartphones and other electronic devices sold in the country.""This would help in achieving the Government of India’s mission to reduce e-waste and move towards sustainable development,” the BIS said.

According to MacRumors, Apple has tested various storage configurations for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max devices such as 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.

For the storage options, Apple is using NAND storage from several companies, including SK Hynix, Western Digital, Kioxia, and Samsung (KS: ).

There were also rumours of a 2TB storage option, but there is no evidence to back this up.

Another leak suggesting that the iPhone 15 Pro will start with 256GB of storage appears to be wrong; it will likely follow the iPhone 14 Pro's storage options, the report mentioned.

As for RAM, the report said that the tech giant is planning to use LPDDR5 DRAM for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, the same RAM type found in last year's flagship devices.

Two RAM configurations were tested -- 6GB and 8GB, with the RAM supplied by Samsung, Micron (NASDAQ: ), and SK Hynix.

However, it's unclear which of these two RAM configurations Apple will choose for the final mass-production units.

Recent reports indicated that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ might come up with 8GB of RAM.

Aside from RAM, the iPhone 15 Pro will feature an upgraded A17 SoC manufactured on TSMC's new 3nm manufacturing process.

The A17 is expected to include an additional GPU core, which will improve graphics performance.

Meanwhile, Apple's next big global product launch -- showcasing the fresh lineup of the iPhone 15 series -- will take place on Tuesday.

The tech giant is also expected to announce new Apple Watches at the event.

The company said its “Wonderlust” event will take place live from Apple Park.

However, customers won't be able to experience these higher speeds right out of the box due to Apple's decision to bundle a USB 2.0 cable with the device.

The USB-C port on the iPhone 15 Pro is capable of data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbits per second, according to Apple's announcement. This is a significant upgrade from the USB 2.0 speeds of 480 Mbits per second that the bundled cable supports. To unlock this higher speed, users will need to purchase an optional USB 3 cable.

Apple stated during its keynote that ""a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR"". Despite this advancement, the company has chosen to ship a USB 2.0 cable with a type-C port with each device.

The company currently offers a Thunderbolt 4 cable on its site for $69, which can unlock these higher data transfer speeds. However, there may also be third-party vendors offering compatible cables in the future.

In addition to the new iPhones, Apple is launching a range of USB-C accessories, including charging cables with higher wattage and a USB-C to lightning dongle. Consumers looking for improved performance over the standard USB-C cable provided will need to invest in these additional products.

While the iPhone 15 also supports a USB-C port, it only offers USB 2.0 speeds. This distinction between the two models marks another step in Apple's ongoing strategy to differentiate its flagship Pro models from the standard offerings.

And when it is sunny, peak outdoor brightness reaches up to 2000 nits — twice as bright as the previous generation.

Both models feature a sophisticated new look that’s built to last. For the first time in a smartphone, color is infused throughout the back glass, creating five beautiful colors. The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure feels even nicer in users’ hands, and the Ceramic Shield® front cover continues to be tougher than any other smartphone glass. With a water- and dust-resistant design2 and industry-leading durability features, iPhone lasts and holds its value longer than any other smartphone. Plus, the internal design provides powerful sustained performance, while improving ease and affordability of repairs.

A Powerful Camera to Capture Every Moment in Super-High Resolution

The advanced camera system on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus helps users capture everyday moments and cherished memories. A 48MP Main camera shoots sharp photos and videos while capturing fine details, with a quad-pixel sensor and 100 percent Focus Pixels for fast autofocus. Using the power of computational photography, the Main camera gives users a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad®, or Mac®. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Shooting at night gets better with improvements to Night mode, including sharper details and more vivid colors. When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth® front camera.

A16 Bionic: Proven, Powerful Performance

The fast and efficient A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering extraordinary battery life.

Better for the Environment

iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus now use even more recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine®, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe — all firsts for iPhone. Both models also include 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB-C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The iPhone 15 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.

To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Apple unveils Apple Watch Ultra 2,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-apple-watch-ultra-2-432SI-3806586,"Apple® today introduced Apple Watch Ultra™ 2, bringing new features to Apple’s most capable and rugged smartwatch, and achieving a significant environmental milestone. Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers all of the features users love about Ultra, plus the powerful new S9 SiP, a magical new double tap gesture, Apple’s brightest display ever, expanded altitude range, on-device Siri®, Precision Finding for iPhone®, and advanced capabilities for water adventures. Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS® 10, which delivers redesigned apps, the new Smart Stack, new cycling experiences, features to help explore the outdoors, and a new watch face — Modular Ultra. With all the new advancements, Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the same 36-hour battery life with regular use and up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode.

For the first time, customers can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch®, representing a significant milestone toward Apple 2030: Apple’s plan to be carbon neutral across its entire business, manufacturing supply chain, and product life cycle by 2030.

Apple Watch Ultra 2 can be ordered today, with availability beginning Friday, September 22.

“This year we’ve made our most rugged and capable Apple Watch even better,” said Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer. “Apple Watch Ultra 2 is our most advanced Apple Watch, with great performance and feature updates. It’s perfect for anyone who wants our biggest, brightest display, longest battery life, and best GPS of any Apple Watch, all in a stunning design.”

Powerful New S9 SiP

Apple Watch Ultra 2 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Ultra 2 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast as the original Apple Watch Ultra.

Double Tap Gesture

Innovations such as the Digital Crown® and Taptic Engine® — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Ultra 2. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.

Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch, or even switch to the new Elevation view in the Compass app to see the relative elevation of saved waypoints.

The new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Ultra 2, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.

Brighter Display

A new advanced display architecture pushes the maximum brightness of Apple Watch Ultra 2 to 3000 nits — 50 percent brighter than the first generation of Apple Watch Ultra and the brightest display Apple has ever designed — for greater readability in harsh sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by. Flashlight also benefits from the new display architecture; rotating the Digital Crown temporarily doubles the brightness to better light the way.

Modular Ultra Watch Face

A new watch face designed for Apple Watch Ultra — Modular Ultra — takes advantage of the large display, using the outermost edge to present real-time data, including seconds, altitude, or depth. It offers the most complications of any Apple digital watch face to customize for sports, outdoor adventures, and ocean and water activities.

Tested for Extremes

Apple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for extremes and has been tested for use across the largest range of altitudes for any Apple product, from 500 meters below sea level to explore the lowest valleys, and up to 9,000 meters to ascend the world’s tallest peaks.

Recreational Scuba Diving and Freediving

Apple Watch Ultra is perfect for water sports, including extreme activities like kitesurfing and wakeboarding, along with recreational scuba diving to 40 meters — and now freediving — with the updated Oceanic+ app from Huish Outdoors.1

The built-in Depth app now saves a log of each session so users can review the most recent sessions on Apple Watch Ultra or view the complete history of all dives with a GPS entry point in the Fitness app on iPhone.

During a freedive with the Oceanic+ app, users will see critical data like depth and elapsed time, and receive target depth alerts, all in big, bold, glanceable text. Between dives, heart rate zones help users monitor and lower their heart rate, and preset alarms like surface time and elapsed session time guide users through each training session. The detailed logbook provides a full profile, including descent and ascent speeds.

On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data

For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, like starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate.

On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, to start an outdoor run or cycling workout, or make requests like setting a waypoint with just their voice, even with no connectivity. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Ultra 2 to log health data such as their weight, body temperature, period, or medications taken.2

Precision Finding

The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it’s in a different room or a user doesn’t remember where it’s been stowed after a dive, for example.

Featuring watchOS 10

Apple Watch Ultra 2 runs watchOS 10, a milestone update that includes:

A fresh approach to quickly view information with redesigned apps and a new Smart Stack to show relevant widgets right when they’re needed.

Delightful new watch faces in addition to the new Modular Ultra face: Snoopy, Palette, Solar Analog, and Nike Globe.

Night Mode now uses the ambient light sensor to automatically activate in the dark.

Bluetooth connectivity for power meters, speed sensors, and cadence sensors arrives for cyclists, unlocking new metrics and Workout Views, and cycling workouts. Power Zones help users get the most out of training.

Cycling workouts can automatically show up as a Live Activity on iPhone and can utilize the full screen when tapped.

The updated Compass app displays current elevation in real time and includes a 3D view of waypoints showing relative elevation.

New topographic maps in the Maps app show important details like points of interest and trailheads, and provide helpful details such as hill shading, contour lines, elevation, and cellular and Emergency SOS waypoints.

Additional tools to support mental health with state of mind logging in the Mindfulness app.

The ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor to help reduce the risk of myopia.

Carbon Neutral Models

Select case and band combinations of Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch SE®, and the new Apple Watch Series 9 are Apple’s first-ever carbon neutral products. As part of Apple 2030, the carbon footprint of Apple Watch Ultra 2 has been significantly decreased. Emissions were reduced from the three biggest sources of greenhouse gases — materials, electricity, and transportation. The small amount of emissions remaining are offset with high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects. Apple Watch Ultra 2 paired with an Alpine Loop or Trail Loop features 95 percent recycled titanium, compared with no recycled titanium in the first Apple Watch Ultra.3 A new logo on Apple Watch Ultra 2 packaging indicates models that are carbon neutral.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Apple unveils its first carbon neutral products,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-unveils-its-first-carbon-neutral-products-432SI-3806579,"Apple® today announced its first-ever carbon neutral products in the all-new Apple Watch® lineup. Innovations in design and clean energy have driven dramatic reductions in product emissions of over 75 percent for each carbon neutral Apple Watch.1 This milestone marks a major step in the company’s journey toward its ambitious Apple 2030 goal to make every product carbon neutral by the end of the decade, including the entire global supply chain and the lifetime use of every device Apple makes.

As part of Apple 2030 and the company’s broader environmental efforts, Apple has also ended the use of leather across all of its product lines, announced its first entirely fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch lineup,2 and continued to expand the use of recycled materials in iPhone®. The company also introduced a new tool in the Home app called Grid Forecast,3 which helps inform users when their power grid has cleaner energy available, so they can decide when to use electricity.

“At Apple, we have a longstanding and proven commitment to leading the fight against climate change. Our focus on renewable energy and low-carbon design has already driven industry-leading emissions reductions, and we’re not slowing down,” said Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives. “We’ve achieved an important milestone in making the world’s most popular watch carbon neutral — and we will keep innovating to meet the urgency of the moment.”

Every Product Carbon Neutral by 2030

Apple has adopted a clear and rigorous approach to product decarbonization that prioritizes reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the three biggest sources across the product life cycle: electricity, materials, and transportation. Only after Apple steeply cuts product emissions, will the company apply high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects for emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced with existing solutions.

Each carbon neutral Apple Watch model meets the following strict criteria: 100 percent clean electricity for manufacturing and product use, 30 percent recycled or renewable material by weight, and 50 percent of shipping without the use of air transportation.4 These combined efforts result in at least a 75 percent reduction in product emissions for each model. The company will use high-quality carbon credits to address the small amount of remaining emissions, resulting in a carbon neutral product footprint. Every carbon neutral Apple Watch — which includes any aluminum Series 9 and SE models when paired with a new Sport Loop, and Apple Watch Ultra™ 2 when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop — is certified by SCS Global Services, a leader in environmental standards and certification.

The Path to 2030

Apple’s first carbon neutral products are the result of years of significant work and innovation across the company and its global supply chain. They also represent the latest step on a journey that began over a decade ago.

In 2020, Apple achieved carbon neutrality for its global corporate operations and announced Apple 2030: a bold strategy to be carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. Apple’s plan centers on an aggressive 75 percent reduction in overall carbon emissions from 2015 levels. By avoiding activities that generate carbon, significantly expanding renewable energy across the company’s corporate operations and supply chain, and designing with recycled and renewable materials, Apple has so far reduced total emissions by over 45 percent since 2015, while still growing revenue by over 65 percent in the same period.

As Apple accelerates efforts to decarbonize its value chain, every product represents an opportunity to reduce emissions — from the electricity used for manufacturing and charging devices, to materials and shipping.

Spurring Progress in Clean Electricity

All manufacturing for the carbon neutral Apple Watch models is powered by 100 percent clean electricity through investments and sourcing by Apple and its suppliers. Additionally, every supplier that manufactures parts and components for these models has committed to 100 percent renewable electricity for all of their Apple production by the end of the decade. Apple also works with manufacturing partners around the world to advocate for policies that support wider deployment of clean energy solutions.

Apple began building and investing in large-scale solar and wind farms to power its data centers and offices over a decade ago. In 2015, the company started working with its manufacturing partners to help them create and invest in their own solar and wind projects, and source renewable energy for all Apple production. Since 2018, all of Apple’s corporate offices, data centers, and retail stores worldwide have been powered by renewable electricity.

Thanks to these combined efforts, Apple and its global suppliers support more than 15 gigawatts of clean energy around the world today — enough to power over 5 million American homes. Across all product lines, more than 300 global suppliers — representing over 90 percent of Apple’s direct manufacturing spend — have now joined Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Program, committing to 100 percent renewable electricity for all Apple production by the end of this decade.

Electricity for manufacturing and charging devices represents the largest source of Apple’s emissions across all product lines. To address the latter, Apple has committed to invest in large-scale solar and wind projects around the world. For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the company will match 100 percent of customers’ expected electricity use for charging.

Innovating in Low-Carbon Design

Apple has pioneered the use of many key recycled materials in its products through world-class product engineering, extensive design qualification, and supply chain expertise. The new products announced today build on these achievements.

To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple is ending the use of leather across all of its product lines, including iPhone accessories and Apple Watch bands. The company will replace leather with a new textile called FineWoven, an elegant and durable twill made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content. FineWoven offers a subtle luster and a soft, suedelike feel, and is available on iPhone MagSafe® cases and wallets as well as the Magnetic Link and Modern Buckle Apple Watch bands.

As recycled and renewable materials often have a lower carbon footprint than primary materials, Apple’s industry-leading progress in the use of recycled content also advances the company’s Apple 2030 goal. The new FineWoven material has significantly lower emissions compared to the more carbon-intensive leather, and both the new iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch lineups advance progress toward the company’s 2025 targets for the use of 100 percent recycled metals in key components. This includes 100 percent recycled rare earth magnets and the company’s first use of 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery of iPhone 15, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.5 Additionally, the popular Sport Loop has been redesigned with 82 percent recycled yarn, which includes material from discarded fishing nets. Customers looking to upgrade to the new carbon neutral Apple Watch models can take advantage of Apple Trade In, and Apple will refurbish the device for a new owner, or recycle it for free.

Apple is also accelerating progress toward plastic-free packaging by 2025. In addition to achieving the first 100 percent fiber-based packaging for the new Apple Watch and band lineup, the packaging for every iPhone 15 model is over 99 percent fiber-based.

Reducing Transportation Emissions

Transporting products around the world makes up about 9 percent of Apple’s comprehensive carbon footprint. The company is shifting more product volume to shipping modes that are less carbon-intensive than air transport, such as ocean or rail. Apple’s carbon footprint methodology shows that shipping the same product by ocean emits 95 percent fewer emissions than by air.

For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, including watches and bands, the company will ship at least 50 percent of the combined weight using non-air modes, cutting total transportation emissions nearly in half. Additionally, the packaging of all Apple Watch Series 9 and SE models has been redesigned for compactness, with a new, smaller shape that allows for 25 percent more devices per shipment.

At the same time, Apple is committed to supporting broader efforts to decarbonize shipping industries, such as by being a member of the First Movers Coalition, and by supporting analysis to identify pathways for developing sustainable aviation fuels. The company also seeks out technical innovations — including the use of alternative fuels and electric vehicles — and selects vendors that offer low-carbon options to help further drive decarbonization in the industry.

Investing in High-Quality Carbon Removal

After achieving steep reductions in product emissions, Apple plans to cover residual emissions with high-quality carbon credits primarily from nature-based projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere, like restoring grasslands, wetlands, and forests. Carbon removal is critical to addressing climate change and achieving global climate goals, as leading scientific bodies like the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have emphasized.

Apple defines high-quality credits as those from projects that are real, additional, measurable, and quantified, with systems in place to avoid double-counting, and that ensure permanence. Apple has helped advance natural carbon-removal solutions that meet this definition by creating the innovative Restore Fund, which currently supports projects in Latin America. The company uses credits from projects that are certified to international standards such as Verra; the Climate, Community & Biodiversity Standards; and the Forest Stewardship Council.

For the carbon neutral Apple Watch models, the high-quality carbon credits used to compensate for the remaining emissions will come from projects like the Restore Fund’s investments with Arbaro Advisors and BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, which are helping to restore and protect high-quality working forests and native ecosystems in Paraguay and Brazil.

Introducing Grid Forecast

As Apple decarbonizes its value chain, the company is also committed to engaging with customers and creating technology that helps them understand and address their environmental impact.

Grid Forecast is a new tool in the Home app on Apple devices that shows when a user’s electrical grid has relatively cleaner or less clean energy sources available. For example, there are times when wind and solar projects produce more energy than the grid can use, leading to some of it being wasted. There are also times when electricity is being generated with lower emissions. By using electricity during these cleaner times, customers may lower the climate impact of the electricity they use at home.

Apple uses data that combines grid, emissions, and weather information into one, easy-to-follow signal. This can help people make decisions about the best time to run large appliances and charge electric vehicles or devices throughout the day. In the contiguous United States, Grid Forecast is available in the Home app on iPhone, iPad®, Mac®, and Apple Watch, and can be added as an iOS widget or a watch face complication. As additional data becomes available through ongoing industry collaboration, Apple will continue refining Grid Forecast to maximize impact.

Beyond its 2030 goal, Apple is also working toward a 90 percent reduction in emissions by 2050 — which requires advocating for collective action from governments, businesses, and individuals to accelerate global progress in the fight against climate change.

Footnotes

1Carbon reductions are calculated against a baseline scenario: No use of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond what is already available on the grid; Apple’s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015; and Apple’s average mix of transportation modes by product line across three years.

2The breakdown of U.S. retail packaging is by weight. Adhesives, inks, and coatings are excluded from calculations of plastic content and packaging weight.

3Grid Forecast will be available in the contiguous United States.

450 percent or more of all carbon neutral products by total weight are planned, as of product launch, to be shipped using non-air modes of transportation — like ocean freight — from the factory to their next destination over the lifetime of the products.

5All cobalt content claims are based on a mass balance allocation."

Powerful New S9 SiP

Apple Watch Series 9 is powered by custom Apple silicon in the all-new S9 SiP. Apple’s most powerful watch chip yet delivers systemwide improvements and brand-new features, including a new double tap gesture and on-device Siri with the ability to access and log health data privately and securely. Apple Watch Series 9 also has a new 4-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning tasks up to twice as fast, when compared with Apple Watch Series 8. The power efficiency of the S9 SiP allows Apple Watch Series 9 to maintain all-day 18-hour battery life.1

Double Tap Gesture

Innovations such as the Digital Crown® and Taptic Engine® — along with gestures like tap, swipe, wrist raise, and cover to mute — make Apple Watch simple and intuitive to use. With a new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 using just one hand and without touching the display. Users can tap the index finger and thumb of their watch hand together twice to quickly and conveniently perform many of the most common actions on Apple Watch Series 9.

Double tap controls the primary button in an app so it can be used to stop a timer, play and pause music, or snooze an alarm. The gesture can be used to answer and end a phone call, and even to take a photo with the Camera Remote on Apple Watch. Double tap will also open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and another double tap will scroll through widgets in the stack.

This new double tap gesture is enabled by the faster Neural Engine in Apple Watch Series 9, which processes data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and optical heart sensor with a new machine learning algorithm. The algorithm detects the unique signature of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb perform a double tap. The double tap gesture will be available in a software update next month.

Brighter Display

The power-efficient S9 SiP and advanced display architecture increase the maximum brightness of the Apple Watch Series 9 display up to 2000 nits — double that of Series 8 — making it even easier to read text in bright sunlight. For dark rooms or early mornings, the display can also lower to just one nit so as not to disturb people close by.

On-Device Siri with Ability to Access and Log Health Data

For the first time on Apple Watch, Siri requests can be processed on device. For requests that do not require information from the internet, such as starting a workout or setting a timer, Siri does not rely on Wi-Fi or cellular networks, resulting in quicker and more reliable responses. The powerful Neural Engine also makes dictation up to 25 percent more accurate than Apple Watch Series 8.

On-device processing is private and secure, and now Siri can be used to access data from the Health app for health- and fitness-related queries. For example, a user can ask how many hours of sleep they had the previous night, for progress on closing their Activity rings, or about their blood glucose level if they have a connected monitor. Users can also make Siri requests on Apple Watch Series 9 to log health data such as their weight, period, or medications taken.2

Precision Finding and HomePod Integration

The ability to use Apple Watch to find iPhone is a favorite user feature. Now, the S9 SiP includes a second-generation Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip to enable Precision Finding for the iPhone 15 family, which has the same chip. Precision Finding provides distance and direction, as well as visual, haptic, and audio guidance to a misplaced iPhone, even if it is in a different room.

UWB also brings deeper integration between Apple Watch and HomePod®. When an Apple Watch user gets within 4 meters of a HomePod playing audio, Apple Watch Series 9 will launch Now Playing to control the media.

According to MacRumors, clicking the like button pushes the logo to spread into pieces, before changing back into the typical love heart. The brief animation mimics the Apple logo graphics used to promote the Apple event -- multi-coloured metallic Apple logos -- possibly a reference to the titanium frame on the ‌iPhone 15 Pro.

The colours used in the Apple logo also match the colours expected for the iPhone 15 Pro, including silver, grey, black, and dark blue, the report said.

A number of users also shared the development on X. ""Is the #AppleEvent animation working for you too,"" a user wrote.

Three years ago, Apple began using Twitter ""like"" animations to promote its events, with the first use being for the September 2020 ""Time Flies"" event.

The ""Wonderlust"" event also features a custom Twitter hashtag with Apple's logo, just like WWDC in June.

At the event, the iPhone 15 is expected to be the most significant update to the device in three years. It will include camera system upgrades across the range, with the Pro models getting an improved 3-nanometer processor.

iPhone 15 is also expected to feature USB-C type for the first time. Introducing a USB-C charging cable point in iPhone 15 is set to herald a new era for Apple.

The new iPhone 15 series was likely to go on sale in the days or weeks following the launch on Tuesday (US time).

According to sources, a small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is set to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

In August, Apple maker Foxconn geared up the local production of the next-generation iPhone 15 at its Sriperumbudur facility near Tamil Nadu (NS: ) faster than ever, as the company doubled down on the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Sources close to the development had told IANS that Apple aims to deliver locally-assembled iPhone 15 as soon as it is launched globally in the middle of next month, in order to narrow the launch-to-availability gap and increase its exports from India to other nations.

Elsewhere, British chip designer Arm will reportedly stop taking orders for its much-anticipated initial public offering a day early due to solid investor demand, while Disney and Charter Communications reach a distribution deal to end a TV blackout that threatened to leave millions of households unable to tune in to the first ""Monday Night Football"" game of the season.

1. Futures slip after positive day on Wall Street

U.S. stock futures fell on Tuesday, pointing to a lower open after a positive day on Wall Street that featured a surge in shares of electric carmaker Tesla.

At 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT), the contract had shed 56 points or 0.2%, lost 11 points or 0.2%, and dipped by 42 points or 0.3%.

The three main indices rose on Monday. Fueling the upticks were Tesla shares, which gained more than 10% after analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) suggested that the company's Dojo supercomputer could give it access to new opportunities beyond ""selling cars at a fixed price."" The analysts added that the Elon Musk-led business may see its market value jump by $600 billion thanks to the technology.

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) also announced that it had extended a deal to supply 5G chips to Apple (NASDAQ: ) until 2026, sending shares in the U.S. semiconductor designer higher by almost 4%.

Looming in the background for equity markets is a slate of major U.S. economic data this week that includes a fresh look at inflation and retail prices. The figures will likely inform whether the Federal Reserve chooses to push on with an aggressive monetary policy tightening campaign later this year.

2. Arm to close IPO order book a day early - reports

Strong demand for chip designer Arm's initial public offering has pushed the banks underwriting the highly-anticipated listing to stop taking orders a day earlier than originally planned, according to various media reports.

Sources familiar with the matter told the Financial Times and Bloomberg News that the order book will close by Tuesday afternoon, with the reports suggesting that the IPO is already anywhere from over five to 10 times oversubscribed. Arm declined to comment to both news outlets.

Arm still reportedly intends to price its shares on Wednesday, with the figure potentially near the top end of -- or even higher than -- its initial range of $47 to $51. At the top end of this band, the company's fully diluted market value could touch $54.5B.

The reports would suggest that investors are widely unperturbed by a fall in Arm's profits over the last quarter or the firm's warning that it is ""susceptible"" to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.



3. Apple expected to unveil new iPhone model

Apple is set to announce the latest version of its flagship iPhone at its annual fall hardware update in California later today.

The event will feature four new models of the ubiquitous device, according to sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal. The WSJ added that the gadgets, which are expected to be called the iPhone 15, will include two base models and two higher-priced advanced versions.

Despite a dip in iPhone revenues in Apple's most recent quarter, the smartphone remains massively important, making up about half of the group's total sales.

But the iPhone may be facing looming headwinds. Along with a slump in the global smartphone market, reports last week said that China has ordered government officials to stop using iPhones for work, stoking concerns over the gadget's future in the country. Analysts have also flagged that a new device from Huawei could threaten Apple's hold on China's market for high-end smartphones.

4. Oil prices move higher



Oil prices rose Tuesday, with futures holding above $90 a barrel, as markets awaiting the release of the OPEC oil producer group's monthly report later in the session.

Traders are particularly on the lookout for OPEC's forecasts for China's oil market, as expectations that the country will drive demand to record highs this year dwindle. Industry data on stocks from the American Petroleum Institute are also due later today, and are expected to continue a recent run of draws.

By 05:54 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $87.96 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $91.21. Last week, Brent touched a level above $90 a barrel for the first time in 10 months on news that Saudi Arabia and Russia had extended their voluntary supply cuts until the end of the year.

5. Disney and Charter reach deal to end ESPN, ABC blackout

Shares in Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ) and Charter Communications (NASDAQ: ) were higher in premarket U.S. trading on Tuesday after the two companies forged a distribution deal that ended a blackout of popular channels like ESPN and ABC.

Under the terms of the agreement, Disney will give select subscribers to Charter's pay-TV service Spectrum access to its advertising-supported Disney+ streaming offering. ESPN+, the entertainment giant's sports-based streaming service, will also be made available to Spectrum customers with more premium subscriptions. Charter will pay Disney higher rates to carry its TV channels in return.

The deal, which was announced on Monday, came just hours before a highly-touted National Football League game between the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills was due to be televised on ESPN. Millions of households may not have been able to watch the match-up if an agreement had not been reached.

The stand-off between Charter and Disney was largely seen as an example of the strained relations between pay-TV firms and entertainment companies during an era of increasing demand for streaming services. In a joint statement, both companies hailed the agreement as ""transformative"" and an ""innovative model for the future."""

The world’s largest iPhone factory is “continuing to expand its workforce ahead of the release of the iPhone 15, with Apple hoping to avoid last year’s supply chain woes at the plant in China,” the report said.

The new workers are expected to help the factory meet demand for Apple’s new products, including iPhone 15.

“The iPhone 15 from Apple is expected to keep sales strong throughout the year and maintain its dominance in the above $600 price range in China,” Counterpoint Research senior analyst Ivan Lam was quoted as saying.

Foxconn offered larger bonuses to returning workers in June this year following a worker exodus and production disruptions.

The iPhone 15 is coming to China amid a new set of challenges, as the country banned iPhone use for certain government officials in the country, creating a chain of reaction that saw Apple stock losing billions.

Beijing instructed some government staff to stop using iPhones through chat groups or meetings, according to an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.

Apple relies heavily on Greater China region for both manufacturing and sales of its iPhones and has a major chunk of its product manufacturing in the country amid its future plans to make India the next big manufacturing hub.

Meanwhile, Huawei launched the foldable Mate X5 and the Mate 60 Pro+ last week, following the launch of the 5G capable Mate 60 Pro last month, with a powerful chip despite tough US restrictions.

The new generation of iPhones were set to be revealed on Tuesday (US time).

Although reports claim that the USB-C port will be available on all iPhone 15 models, famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that only the Pro and Pro Max will benefit from faster data transfer rates.

Both premium models will have ""at least"" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will have USB 2.0 ports.

Some Apple iPhone 15 models are likely to support charging up to 35W which will offer faster charging speeds.

Apple shifting to USB-C comes as the European Commission has made a move by passing a resolution that all smartphone makers will be required to support USB-C as a single charging standard for all mobile devices across the EU nations by 2024.

In India, nine in 10 Indian consumers want the government to drive standardisation of charging cables on priority as it will reduce inconvenience and make charging cables more affordable, according to community social media platform LocalCircles.

Most consumers now demand that the government should create common standards for USB charging cables like the EU as they believe standardisation will drive prices lower and make original charging cables more affordable.

Earlier this year, the Indian government announced the standardisation of charging cables as the Type-C chord for various electronic devices like mobile phones, laptops, notebooks, and more.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) published standards for USB Type C receptacles, plug and cables, which is aimed at providing common charging solutions for the smartphones and other electronic devices sold in the country.""This would help in achieving the Government of India’s mission to reduce e-waste and move towards sustainable development,” the BIS said.

For the storage options, Apple is using NAND storage from several companies, including SK Hynix, Western Digital, Kioxia, and Samsung (KS: ).

There were also rumours of a 2TB storage option, but there is no evidence to back this up.

Another leak suggesting that the iPhone 15 Pro will start with 256GB of storage appears to be wrong; it will likely follow the iPhone 14 Pro's storage options, the report mentioned.

As for RAM, the report said that the tech giant is planning to use LPDDR5 DRAM for the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, the same RAM type found in last year's flagship devices.

Two RAM configurations were tested -- 6GB and 8GB, with the RAM supplied by Samsung, Micron (NASDAQ: ), and SK Hynix.

However, it's unclear which of these two RAM configurations Apple will choose for the final mass-production units.

Recent reports indicated that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ might come up with 8GB of RAM.

Aside from RAM, the iPhone 15 Pro will feature an upgraded A17 SoC manufactured on TSMC's new 3nm manufacturing process.

The A17 is expected to include an additional GPU core, which will improve graphics performance.

Meanwhile, Apple's next big global product launch -- showcasing the fresh lineup of the iPhone 15 series -- will take place on Tuesday.

Despite the potential ban, which coincides with Huawei's launch of new smartphones, including the Mate 60 Pro, Goldman Sachs believes any direct impacts of the reported government ban should prove minimal.

""State-owned employees only represent about 7.5% of the employed population, implying an up to 1% revenue impact to AAPL given that Greater China represents 19% of AAPL's F22 revenue, though we recognize there may be indirect risks related to spillover effects to consumer demand and geopolitical tension,"" explained Ng, who has Buy rating and $222 price target on the stock.

""Increased competition from Huawei with the launch of its new phones could prove a headwind, but AAPL's market share gains in the last several years should prove durable given investments into the Apple ecosystem and continued technological competitive advantages,"" he added.

Investors have been hoping the Fed was near the end of its rate tightening after moving rates from zero to above 5% since early 2022. While Fed officials have indicted they could pause in September, they have signaled that doesn't mean there won't be any additional rate hikes. It all depends on what the data show, they say.

Recent data has shown a slowing in inflationary pressure and labor market tightness, and more data this week could add to that. The consumer price index is due out on Wednesday, and the producer price index is due out Thursday.

Futures markets are putting the probability of a rate increase in November in the high 40-percentage range, with expectations for a rate pause currently a little higher than 50%.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Apple event

Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is kicking off a live event at 13:00 ET (17:00 GMT) at which it is widely expected to unveil its new iPhone 15s, complete with new features and perhaps a slightly higher price on the Pro models than the previous model. Analysts are also looking for updates on Apple Watches.

2. Small business optimism

The reading for August is due out at 6:00 ET. Analysts expect a reading of 91.6 versus 91.9 in the prior reading.

3. Congress returns

Lawmakers have returned to Capitol Hill after a summer break with a looming deadline to fund the federal government past Oct. 1.

The news came after reports speculating that Apple will move to its own in-house 5G modem solution by 2025.

The chip-maker said the agreement “reinforces Qualcomm’s track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products”.

Apple will continue to use Qualcomm 5G modems for at least three more years now with the new agreement between the two companies.

Apple remains Qualcomm’s largest customer, accounting for nearly a quarter of the chipmaker’s revenue.

Earlier reports mentioned that Apple may move into making in-house 5G modem chips for its 2024 iPhones.

Although Apple's most recent iPhone 14 models use Qualcomm modems, the company has been attempting to go it solo in the wireless connectivity market for several years, reports CNBC.

Apple bought Intel (NASDAQ: )'s modem business in 2019, and there had been speculation it would begin using in-house parts this year.

The Cupertino-based tech giant is currently working on its own 5G chip for future iPhones but it may not debut until 2025.

Despite the potential ban, which coincides with Huawei's launch of new smartphones, including the Mate 60 Pro, Goldman Sachs believes any direct impacts of the reported government ban should prove minimal.

""State-owned employees only represent about 7.5% of the employed population, implying an up to 1% revenue impact to AAPL given that Greater China represents 19% of AAPL's F22 revenue, though we recognize there may be indirect risks related to spillover effects to consumer demand and geopolitical tension,"" explained Ng, who has Buy rating and $222 price target on the stock.

""Increased competition from Huawei with the launch of its new phones could prove a headwind, but AAPL's market share gains in the last several years should prove durable given investments into the Apple ecosystem and continued technological competitive advantages,"" he added.

The Goldman Sachs analyst believes that even if AAPL's iPhone shipments in China declined by ~15 million to the ~32 million annual pace in C2018/19, they estimate a 3-4% headwind to revenue & EPS.

Along with this, Apple might announce the release dates for iOS 17 and watchOS 10 during its upcoming event.

Although reports claim that the USB-C port will be available on all iPhone 15 models, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that only the Pro and Pro Max will benefit from faster data transfer rates.

Both premium models will have ""at least"" USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3 ports, while the base iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will have USB 2.0 ports.

Some Apple iPhone 15 models are likely to support charging up to 35W which will offer faster charging speeds.

In addition, supply chain analyst Ross Young predicted last year that all models of the iPhone 15 would include the Dynamic Island. The iPhone 15 lineup is also expected to get an ultra-wideband chip as well.

Moreover, the report said that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are rumoured to feature a titanium frame, slimmer bezels, and a more easily repairable aluminium chassis, similar to the iPhone 14.

The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max might also have a faster A17 chip built using the 3nm process, whereas the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus will most likely include the A16 chip included in the iPhone 14 Pro.

In addition to the iPhone 15, Apple is expected to unveil its latest smartwatch lineup -- with few major changes so far.

The premium Apple Watch Ultra will reportedly retain its 49mm size and come with a new darker titanium case. But as per rumours the Watch Series 9 will come with an updated S9 processor, the report mentioned.

The iPhone 15 isn’t the only Apple device that’s expected to get the USB-C treatment. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans on releasing a pair of AirPods Pro with USB-C during the event.

Kuo predicted in 2022 that Apple would release AirPods with a USB-C charging case this year. Aside from the new case, it's unclear whether Apple will make any significant changes to the AirPods themselves.

2022-09-09, IANS,Apple set to end 2022 with 7% market share for iPhones in Android-dominated India,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-set-to-end-2022-with-7-market-share-for-iphones-in-androiddominated-india-3802932,"New Delhi, Sep 9 (IANS) Driven by domestic manufacturing, Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhones are set to garner 7 per cent market share in the Android-dominated smartphone market in India this year, latest data showed on Saturday, as the tech giant gears up to globally launch its flagship devices next week.Apple iPhone shipments grew 68 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half of this year in the country.

In the first half, Apple secured a 6 per cent market share in the Indian smartphone market and dominated the super-premium smartphone segment (priced between Rs 50,000-Rs 100,000) with a robust 63 per cent market share, according to data from market intelligence firm CyberMedia Research (CMR).

CMR estimates the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter to hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiatives.

iPhone domestic manufacturing in the country has significantly increased over the past four year.

In another push to its India manufacturing dream, Apple maker Foxconn started the local production of the next-generation of iPhone 15 at its Sriperumbudur facility near Tamil Nadu (NS: ) faster than ever.

A small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is likely to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

Other Apple suppliers in India like Pegatron and Wistron (being acquired by the Tata Group) will also assemble iPhone 15 as soon as possible, according to sources.

CMR anticipates a 25 per cent YoY growth in iPhone shipments with the iPhone 15 series.

iPhone 14 series shipments in launch quarter were around 58 per cent and iPhone 13 series were around 23 per cent in the country.

“Apple has enjoyed a positive growth trajectory in India in recent years, with sales of its older generation iPhones steering growth. The upcoming iPhone 15 series is poised to maintain this growth momentum,” Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

However, its success will hinge on Apple's ability to effectively manage any potential production challenges and shipment delays with the 15 line-up, and especially the 'Pro' models, he added.

The market momentum for iPhones in India have been driven by the sales of the previous generaIon iPhones.

Apple is hosting its next big global product launch -- showcasing the fresh lineup of iPhone 15 series -- on September 12. The tech giant is also expected to announce new Apple Watches at the event.

Media reports suggesting that government officials in China have been barred from using Apple’s iPhone and other foreign-branded mobile devices at work have sparked concerns that Beijing is willing to sideline American companies in favor of Chinese players. China is a crucial market for Apple, with the country accounting for nearly a fifth of its total sales.

Observers have warned that such a move, which has yet to be confirmed by either the Chinese government or Apple, could signal a deepening in ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Recently, some U.S. lawmakers have called for a blanket ban on tech exports to China, citing a breach of recent trade restrictions by two companies: Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (HK: ).

However, analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) argued that it is ""unlikely"" that the reported iPhone ban will ""evolve into something broader.""

“In a worst case scenario, we see 4% revenue and 3% [earnings per share] downside, suggesting the stock move is overdone,” the Morgan Stanley analysts added.

Meanwhile, California-based Apple, which is gearing up to launch the latest model of the iPhone next week, faces fresh competition from a new family of high-end smartphones made by Chinese rival Huawei. Analysts at Citi said the launch of Huawei's Mate 60 gadget presents a ""headline risk"" for the company's shares.

The roughly 6% slide in Apple's stock price over the previous two sessions this week was felt in trading on Wall Street on Thursday, with the tech-heavy in particular slipping. The index rose on Friday morning.

Elsewhere, Apple's regional suppliers in Asia saw their shares drop. South Korea's SK Hynix (KS: ), which supplies Apple with memory chips, fell by 4.1%, while phone display-provider Samsung Electronics (KS: ) shed 0.1%.

Taiwan’s Taiwan Semicon (TW: ) dipped by 1.5%, while Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ) in China, a source of connector cables for a slew of Apple devices, decreased by about 2.0%.

Hong Kong-listed supplier AAC Technologies) Holdings (HK: ), a builder of Apple's AirPods headphones, was down nearly 6% this week, although the stock did not trade on Friday due to a broader trade suspension in Hong Kong.

The major Wall Street indices closed mixed Thursday, with the blue-chip ending almost 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, while the tech-heavy dropped 0.9% and the broad-based fell 0.3%.

Tech stocks hit by rising Fed hike expectations

Stronger-than-expected economic data, including Thursday’s reading for last week that was lower than expected, has raised concerns that Fed will keep interest rates at elevated levels for longer than previously expected.

This has disproportionately impacted the richly valued tech stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite index down over 2% this week, falling for four straight days.

The is still widely expected to hold steady on rates when it meets later this month, but this economic resilience suggests that future hikes are not off the table.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President said on Thursday that while ""forecasts are inherently uncertain. My base case, though, is that there is work left to do.""

The economic data slate is quiet Friday, with and the reading, both for July, the only figures of note expected.

Apple remains in the spotlight

In the corporate sector, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is likely to remain in the spotlight with the world’s most valuable company having seen about $200 billion wiped from its market capitalization in two days on reports of China curbing iPhone use by state employees.

The restrictions point to a potential slowdown in Apple’s iPhone sales, which are the company’s biggest revenue driver. China is also the third-biggest contributor to Apple’s revenue, as of its second-quarter earnings.

Apple is also set to launch its new range of iPhone 15 phones next week.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,Full restriction of TAC payments; worst-case scenario for Google and Apple - Morgan Stanley,https://in.investing.com/news/full-restriction-of-tac-payments-worstcase-scenario-for-google-and-apple--morgan-stanley-432SI-3802383,"In a note to clients Friday, Morgan Stanley analysts assessed the DoJ vs. Google trial and why it matters to both Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The trial is scheduled to begin on September 12, with the DoJ alleging that Google illegally obtained its dominance in search and search advertising.

According to the analysts, the key question is whether a final ruling could result in changes to Google's Search contracts with hardware OEMs (i.e. Apple, Samsung (KS: ), etc.), wireless carriers, and web browser companies.

""We would expect the judge to focus on Section 2 of the Sherman Act... which makes it illegal to acquire or maintain a monopoly through improper means,"" they wrote. While the initial ruling is possible by the end of 2022, the appeals process could push the final decision into mid-to-late 2024.

According to the analysts, there are three potential scenarios: Status Quo, Structural Contract Changes, and Full TAC Removal.

For the status quo scenario, they stated: ""If the Court rules that there is legal basis for Google's TAC payments to Apple, Samsung, and others, then there likely won't be a material change to the nature of these contracts... and as a result no change to Google or Apple's P&L."" This is the best-case scenario for Apple and companies that receive TAC payments from Google, while it will also be positive for the search engine giant too, Morgan Stanley believes.

For structural contract changes, the analysts said: ""In this scenario, the Court could rule that Google cannot pay for default search engine placement, but that Apple and others are still allowed to charge variable TAC based on search revenue generated. TAC payments would fall, but the removal of exclusivity could cause some users to switch away from GOOGL.""

In the case of a full restriction of TAC payments, Morgan Stanley explains: ""In this (most extreme) scenario, Google would be unable to make any payments for TAC to OEM partners. On the plus side, this would remove an estimated ~$28bn of annual US distribution TAC from GOOGL's P&L in '25. On the risk side, it again may cause some US users to switch to other search engines (i.e. Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.)."" Even so, the investment bank said their math suggests that more than 37% of current US users would have to switch to an alternative search engine for there to be a drag on Google's net revenue. However, it is the worst-case scenario for Apple as they would no longer be paid TAC for making Google the default search browser on Safari."

Coupled with Huawei launching a new family of high-end smartphones, Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock initially lost 3.6% on Wednesday before dropping nearly 3% on Thursday.

Analysts are worried about the potential impact on Apple's iPhone sales, given that China is one of its most important markets and a major contributor to its revenue (~19%).

Here’s what top Apple analysts have to say about the most recent developments.

JPMorgan: “Even in the case of iPhone revenue/volume expectations following the launch meeting/beating low investor expectations, the magnitude of the upside to shares in the remainder of the year is going to be limited by the outperformance YTD as well as an earnings multiple that is at an ~61% premium to 2H of 2019 when AAPL shares outperformed in a similar fashion by meeting/beating low investor expectations for the iPhone 11 cycle.”

Citi: “While we remain positive into iPhone 15 launch event on Sep 12th ($100-$200 price increases for Pro models + strong replacement cycle in iPhone 12 installed base) and do not see the recent China Government/State agencies iPhone ban as a material impact to iPhone units, we view the recent news flow around China and Huawei Mate 60 launch as a headline risk for the stock.”

Bernstein: “A China ban on iPhones could signal a first step in an escalating trade war with China, which could present additional risk to Apple, given its very high concentration of manufacturing in the country.”

Morgan Stanley: “We believe Apple's 2-day -6% stock move suggests the market thinks recent China headlines will evolve into something broader. We believe that's unlikely. In a worst case scenario, we see 4% rev and 3% EPS downside, suggesting the stock move is overdone.”

It is the third member of the Mate 60 family. According to various media reports, the new phone will come with 16 GB of RAM and will offer two storage options: 512 GB or a whopping 1 TB.

The starting price for the Mate 60 Pro+ is rumored to be CNY8,999, which translates to approximately $1,231 or €1,150. The company began accepting orders for the Mate 60 Pro+ on its official online store with delivery expected by October 9.

The phone is touted to be capable of linking up to two satellites concurrently and offers larger internal storage compared to the Mate 60 Pro.

Speed tests conducted by buyers on Chinese social media have shown that the Mate 60 Pro+ can achieve download speeds exceeding those of top-line 5G phones.

Huawei also launched the Huawei Mate X5, a new addition to its foldable phone series.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock is under increasing pressure in recent days due to the potential China government ban on iPhone use within government agencies, as well as new smartphone launches from Huawei.

“Apple's -6% stock move in the last 2 trading days looks unwarranted relative to the 4% revenue and 3% EPS downside (~20c) we see if Apple were to cede all of the share it has gained from Huawei in the high end ($500+ ASP) Chinese smartphone market over the last 3 years, or about 18M units (~40% of Apple's T12M China iPhone shipments),” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

1. futures inch down after Apple-driven decline

U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Friday, as investors gauged a sharp drop in Apple's stock this week and weighed the possibility of more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year.

At 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT), the contract lost 61 points or 0.2%, fell by 10 points or 0.2%, and shed 45 points or 0.3%.

The main indices on Wall Street were mixed at the close of trading on Thursday, with the 30-stock edging up 0.2% and the benchmark dipping by 0.3%.

Attention widely centered around a Wall Street Journal report that central government officials in China had been ordered not to use Apple's iPhone and other foreign-branded mobile devices for work, which traders took as a potential sign that Beijing may be willing to sideline American tech companies in favor of their Chinese counterparts. A separate report from the Financial Times said that state employees across China have also been told to cease using iPhones.

Shares in Apple, which relies on China for almost a fifth of its total revenue and is set to unveil the latest model of its mega-popular iPhone next week, slumped to a second consecutive day of losses, dragging the tech-heavy down by 0.9%.

2. Apple stabilizes premarket after two-day tumble

Apple shares held near the flatline in premarket U.S. trading on Friday following a slide of about 6% over the past two sessions that has now wiped close to $200 billion in value off of the stock's market capitalization.

The losses had a wide-spread impact in Asia, particularly on Apple's regional suppliers. South Korea's SK Hynix (KS: ), which supplies Apple with memory chips, fell by 4.1%, while phone display-provider Samsung Electronics (KS: ) shed 0.1%.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) dipped by 0.7%, while display manufacturer Japan Display (TYO: ) decreased by 2.5%. In China, Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ), a source of connector cables for a slew of Apple devices, dropped 3.2%.

Hong Kong-listed supplier AAC Technologies (HK: ), a builder of Apple's AirPods headphones, was down nearly 6% this week, although the stock did not trade on Friday due to a broader trade suspension in Hong Kong.

3. Fed officials back rate pause

Senior officials on the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee on Thursday seemingly threw their support behind keeping interest rates steady at the central bank's upcoming meeting later this month.

Speaking at a Bloomberg event, John Williams, New York Fed President and voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, suggested that rates are currently ""in a good place."" Williams added, however, that it is an ""open question as we go forward"" whether the Fed would need to continue tightening policy to help slow the economy to a point that cools inflation down to its 2% target.

Elsewhere, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan -- widely considered to be one of the more hawkish FOMC voters -- said that it would be ""appropriate"" to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.50% this month.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller also backed a rate pause earlier this week, telling CNBC that recent U.S. economic data did not indicate that policymakers needed to take ""imminent"" action.

The comments were some of the last investors will hear from Fed officials before a customary black-out period ahead of their two-day gathering scheduled for Sept. 19-20.

4. Crude reverses losses

Oil prices gained on Friday, paring back earlier losses despite lingering concerns over the health of the crucial Chinese economy and a stronger dollar.

Both benchmarks are on course for weekly gains of around 2%, a rally that has been broadly driven by news that top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Additionally, data released late Thursday showed that U.S. inventories shrank a hefty 6.3 million barrels in the week to September 1, falling for the fourth consecutive week.

By 05:54 ET, the futures traded 0.2% higher at $87.08 a barrel, while the contract added 0.4% to $90.25 per barrel.

5. Yellen addresses China slowdown

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen predicted that China's sputtering post-pandemic recovery will likely not take a major toll on the American economy, but could hit east Asian countries hard.

In a speech at the G20 summit of world leaders in India, Yellen said she does not see China's downturn having a ""very significant direct impact"" on the U.S., although she noted that Washington is monitoring the situation closely.

Yellen added that Beijing does have ""policy space"" to help reignite growth in the world's second largest economy, which has been slammed by contracting exports, a weakening manufacturing industry and a property sector liquidity crisis.

China has yet to roll out large-scale stimulus measures despite increasing calls to do so. Officials have instead opted to introduce measures to prop up specific industries or support the local currency, which finished its domestic session on Friday at its weakest level since the global financial crisis."

""AMOS was first advertised in April 2022 as a stealer for Mac OS with a strong focus on crypto assets, capable of harvesting passwords from browsers and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s keychain, as well as featuring a file grabber. The developer has been actively working on the project, releasing a new version at the end of June,"" the researchers said.

Criminals who purchase the toolkit distribute the malware primarily through cracked software downloads, but they also impersonate legitimate websites and use ads on search engines such as Google to lure victims in.

According to the report, users who want to download a new programme naturally go to Google and search for it. Threat actors are purchasing advertisements that look like well-known brands and tricking victims into visiting their site as if it were the official one.

Once the user clicks the link, they are presented with a normal-looking page. The attackers create a near-perfect clone of the website users expect, so they click through and download the software.

After opening the file, a fake prompt for the system password appears repeatedly until the user relents and enters their password.

It then extracts as much information as it can from the user's Keychain, file system, and crypto wallets and sends it to the malware's operator, the report explained.

In the first half, Apple secured a 6 per cent market share in the Indian smartphone market and dominated the super-premium smartphone segment (priced between Rs 50,000-Rs 100,000) with a robust 63 per cent market share, according to data from market intelligence firm CyberMedia Research (CMR).

CMR estimates the iPhone 15 shipments in the launch quarter to hover around 65 per cent, driven by an increased ‘Make in India’ initiatives.

iPhone domestic manufacturing in the country has significantly increased over the past four year.

In another push to its India manufacturing dream, Apple maker Foxconn started the local production of the next-generation of iPhone 15 at its Sriperumbudur facility near Tamil Nadu (NS: ) faster than ever.

A small set of ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units is likely to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

Other Apple suppliers in India like Pegatron and Wistron (being acquired by the Tata Group) will also assemble iPhone 15 as soon as possible, according to sources.

CMR anticipates a 25 per cent YoY growth in iPhone shipments with the iPhone 15 series.

iPhone 14 series shipments in launch quarter were around 58 per cent and iPhone 13 series were around 23 per cent in the country.

“Apple has enjoyed a positive growth trajectory in India in recent years, with sales of its older generation iPhones steering growth. The upcoming iPhone 15 series is poised to maintain this growth momentum,” Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

However, its success will hinge on Apple's ability to effectively manage any potential production challenges and shipment delays with the 15 line-up, and especially the 'Pro' models, he added.

The market momentum for iPhones in India have been driven by the sales of the previous generaIon iPhones.

Apple is hosting its next big global product launch -- showcasing the fresh lineup of iPhone 15 series -- on September 12. The tech giant is also expected to announce new Apple Watches at the event.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,Apple shares move higher after steep two-day sell-off,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-shares-move-higher-after-steep-twoday-selloff-3802421,"Investing.com -- Shares in Apple (NASDAQ: ) climbed in early U.S. trading on Friday, paring back some losses from two straight days of declines that wiped around $200 billion off of the tech giant's market value.



Media reports suggesting that government officials in China have been barred from using Apple’s iPhone and other foreign-branded mobile devices at work have sparked concerns that Beijing is willing to sideline American companies in favor of Chinese players. China is a crucial market for Apple, with the country accounting for nearly a fifth of its total sales.

Observers have warned that such a move, which has yet to be confirmed by either the Chinese government or Apple, could signal a deepening in ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Recently, some U.S. lawmakers have called for a blanket ban on tech exports to China, citing a breach of recent trade restrictions by two companies: Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International (HK: ).

However, analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) argued that it is ""unlikely"" that the reported iPhone ban will ""evolve into something broader.""

“In a worst case scenario, we see 4% revenue and 3% [earnings per share] downside, suggesting the stock move is overdone,” the Morgan Stanley analysts added.

Meanwhile, California-based Apple, which is gearing up to launch the latest model of the iPhone next week, faces fresh competition from a new family of high-end smartphones made by Chinese rival Huawei. Analysts at Citi said the launch of Huawei's Mate 60 gadget presents a ""headline risk"" for the company's shares.

The roughly 6% slide in Apple's stock price over the previous two sessions this week was felt in trading on Wall Street on Thursday, with the tech-heavy in particular slipping. The index rose on Friday morning.

Elsewhere, Apple's regional suppliers in Asia saw their shares drop. South Korea's SK Hynix (KS: ), which supplies Apple with memory chips, fell by 4.1%, while phone display-provider Samsung Electronics (KS: ) shed 0.1%.

Taiwan’s Taiwan Semicon (TW: ) dipped by 1.5%, while Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ) in China, a source of connector cables for a slew of Apple devices, decreased by about 2.0%.

Hong Kong-listed supplier AAC Technologies) Holdings (HK: ), a builder of Apple's AirPods headphones, was down nearly 6% this week, although the stock did not trade on Friday due to a broader trade suspension in Hong Kong.

The major Wall Street indices closed mixed Thursday, with the blue-chip ending almost 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, while the tech-heavy dropped 0.9% and the broad-based fell 0.3%.

Tech stocks hit by rising Fed hike expectations

Stronger-than-expected economic data, including Thursday’s reading for last week that was lower than expected, has raised concerns that Fed will keep interest rates at elevated levels for longer than previously expected.

This has disproportionately impacted the richly valued tech stocks, with the Nasdaq Composite index down over 2% this week, falling for four straight days.

The is still widely expected to hold steady on rates when it meets later this month, but this economic resilience suggests that future hikes are not off the table.

Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President said on Thursday that while ""forecasts are inherently uncertain. My base case, though, is that there is work left to do.""

The economic data slate is quiet Friday, with and the reading, both for July, the only figures of note expected.

Apple remains in the spotlight

In the corporate sector, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is likely to remain in the spotlight with the world’s most valuable company having seen about $200 billion wiped from its market capitalization in two days on reports of China curbing iPhone use by state employees.

The restrictions point to a potential slowdown in Apple’s iPhone sales, which are the company’s biggest revenue driver. China is also the third-biggest contributor to Apple’s revenue, as of its second-quarter earnings.

Apple is also set to launch its new range of iPhone 15 phones next week.

Grocery chain Kroger (NYSE: ) posted a loss for the recent quarter after agreeing to pay $1.2 billion to settle claims over the sale of opioid pills. Shares rose more than 1%.

Crude set for weekly gains

Oil prices gained on Friday, paring back earlier losses despite lingering concerns over the health of the crucial Chinese economy and a stronger dollar.

The main benchmarks are on course for gains of around 2% this week on the back of the news that top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Additionally, data released late Thursday showed that U.S. inventories shrank a hefty 6.3 million barrels in the week to September 1, falling for the fourth consecutive week.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,Full restriction of TAC payments; worst-case scenario for Google and Apple - Morgan Stanley,https://in.investing.com/news/full-restriction-of-tac-payments-worstcase-scenario-for-google-and-apple--morgan-stanley-432SI-3802383,"In a note to clients Friday, Morgan Stanley analysts assessed the DoJ vs. Google trial and why it matters to both Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The trial is scheduled to begin on September 12, with the DoJ alleging that Google illegally obtained its dominance in search and search advertising.

According to the analysts, the key question is whether a final ruling could result in changes to Google's Search contracts with hardware OEMs (i.e. Apple, Samsung (KS: ), etc.), wireless carriers, and web browser companies.

""We would expect the judge to focus on Section 2 of the Sherman Act... which makes it illegal to acquire or maintain a monopoly through improper means,"" they wrote. While the initial ruling is possible by the end of 2022, the appeals process could push the final decision into mid-to-late 2024.

According to the analysts, there are three potential scenarios: Status Quo, Structural Contract Changes, and Full TAC Removal.

For the status quo scenario, they stated: ""If the Court rules that there is legal basis for Google's TAC payments to Apple, Samsung, and others, then there likely won't be a material change to the nature of these contracts... and as a result no change to Google or Apple's P&L."" This is the best-case scenario for Apple and companies that receive TAC payments from Google, while it will also be positive for the search engine giant too, Morgan Stanley believes.

For structural contract changes, the analysts said: ""In this scenario, the Court could rule that Google cannot pay for default search engine placement, but that Apple and others are still allowed to charge variable TAC based on search revenue generated. TAC payments would fall, but the removal of exclusivity could cause some users to switch away from GOOGL.""

In the case of a full restriction of TAC payments, Morgan Stanley explains: ""In this (most extreme) scenario, Google would be unable to make any payments for TAC to OEM partners. On the plus side, this would remove an estimated ~$28bn of annual US distribution TAC from GOOGL's P&L in '25. On the risk side, it again may cause some US users to switch to other search engines (i.e. Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.)."" Even so, the investment bank said their math suggests that more than 37% of current US users would have to switch to an alternative search engine for there to be a drag on Google's net revenue. However, it is the worst-case scenario for Apple as they would no longer be paid TAC for making Google the default search browser on Safari."

Coupled with Huawei launching a new family of high-end smartphones, Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock initially lost 3.6% on Wednesday before dropping nearly 3% on Thursday.

Analysts are worried about the potential impact on Apple's iPhone sales, given that China is one of its most important markets and a major contributor to its revenue (~19%).

Here’s what top Apple analysts have to say about the most recent developments.

JPMorgan: “Even in the case of iPhone revenue/volume expectations following the launch meeting/beating low investor expectations, the magnitude of the upside to shares in the remainder of the year is going to be limited by the outperformance YTD as well as an earnings multiple that is at an ~61% premium to 2H of 2019 when AAPL shares outperformed in a similar fashion by meeting/beating low investor expectations for the iPhone 11 cycle.”

Citi: “While we remain positive into iPhone 15 launch event on Sep 12th ($100-$200 price increases for Pro models + strong replacement cycle in iPhone 12 installed base) and do not see the recent China Government/State agencies iPhone ban as a material impact to iPhone units, we view the recent news flow around China and Huawei Mate 60 launch as a headline risk for the stock.”

Bernstein: “A China ban on iPhones could signal a first step in an escalating trade war with China, which could present additional risk to Apple, given its very high concentration of manufacturing in the country.”

Morgan Stanley: “We believe Apple's 2-day -6% stock move suggests the market thinks recent China headlines will evolve into something broader. We believe that's unlikely. In a worst case scenario, we see 4% rev and 3% EPS downside, suggesting the stock move is overdone.”

China's Huawei launches its strongest smartphone - Mate 60 Pro+,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-15-max-pro-rival-chinas-huawei-launches-its-strongest-smartphone--mate-60-pro-432SI-3802073,"China's Huawei Technologies has started presales for its high-end Mate 60 Pro+ smartphone, adding to its lineup of devices that have gained attention for the company's resilience against U.S. sanctions.

It is the third member of the Mate 60 family. According to various media reports, the new phone will come with 16 GB of RAM and will offer two storage options: 512 GB or a whopping 1 TB.

The starting price for the Mate 60 Pro+ is rumored to be CNY8,999, which translates to approximately $1,231 or €1,150. The company began accepting orders for the Mate 60 Pro+ on its official online store with delivery expected by October 9.

The phone is touted to be capable of linking up to two satellites concurrently and offers larger internal storage compared to the Mate 60 Pro.

Speed tests conducted by buyers on Chinese social media have shown that the Mate 60 Pro+ can achieve download speeds exceeding those of top-line 5G phones.

Huawei also launched the Huawei Mate X5, a new addition to its foldable phone series.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock is under increasing pressure in recent days due to the potential China government ban on iPhone use within government agencies, as well as new smartphone launches from Huawei.

“Apple's -6% stock move in the last 2 trading days looks unwarranted relative to the 4% revenue and 3% EPS downside (~20c) we see if Apple were to cede all of the share it has gained from Huawei in the high end ($500+ ASP) Chinese smartphone market over the last 3 years, or about 18M units (~40% of Apple's T12M China iPhone shipments),” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Elsewhere, two more Federal Reserve policymakers hint that the central bank may skip hiking interest rates at its September gathering, while U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggests that China's post-COVID economic woes may not have a ""significant impact"" on the United States.

1. futures inch down after Apple-driven decline

U.S. stock futures pointed lower on Friday, as investors gauged a sharp drop in Apple's stock this week and weighed the possibility of more Federal Reserve rate hikes this year.

At 05:53 ET (09:53 GMT), the contract lost 61 points or 0.2%, fell by 10 points or 0.2%, and shed 45 points or 0.3%.

The main indices on Wall Street were mixed at the close of trading on Thursday, with the 30-stock edging up 0.2% and the benchmark dipping by 0.3%.

Attention widely centered around a Wall Street Journal report that central government officials in China had been ordered not to use Apple's iPhone and other foreign-branded mobile devices for work, which traders took as a potential sign that Beijing may be willing to sideline American tech companies in favor of their Chinese counterparts. A separate report from the Financial Times said that state employees across China have also been told to cease using iPhones.

Shares in Apple, which relies on China for almost a fifth of its total revenue and is set to unveil the latest model of its mega-popular iPhone next week, slumped to a second consecutive day of losses, dragging the tech-heavy down by 0.9%.

2. Apple stabilizes premarket after two-day tumble

Apple shares held near the flatline in premarket U.S. trading on Friday following a slide of about 6% over the past two sessions that has now wiped close to $200 billion in value off of the stock's market capitalization.

The losses had a wide-spread impact in Asia, particularly on Apple's regional suppliers. South Korea's SK Hynix (KS: ), which supplies Apple with memory chips, fell by 4.1%, while phone display-provider Samsung Electronics (KS: ) shed 0.1%.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) dipped by 0.7%, while display manufacturer Japan Display (TYO: ) decreased by 2.5%. In China, Luxshare Precision Industry (SZ: ), a source of connector cables for a slew of Apple devices, dropped 3.2%.

Hong Kong-listed supplier AAC Technologies (HK: ), a builder of Apple's AirPods headphones, was down nearly 6% this week, although the stock did not trade on Friday due to a broader trade suspension in Hong Kong.

3. Fed officials back rate pause

Senior officials on the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee on Thursday seemingly threw their support behind keeping interest rates steady at the central bank's upcoming meeting later this month.

Speaking at a Bloomberg event, John Williams, New York Fed President and voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, suggested that rates are currently ""in a good place."" Williams added, however, that it is an ""open question as we go forward"" whether the Fed would need to continue tightening policy to help slow the economy to a point that cools inflation down to its 2% target.

Elsewhere, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan -- widely considered to be one of the more hawkish FOMC voters -- said that it would be ""appropriate"" to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at a 22-year high of 5.25% to 5.50% this month.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller also backed a rate pause earlier this week, telling CNBC that recent U.S. economic data did not indicate that policymakers needed to take ""imminent"" action.

The comments were some of the last investors will hear from Fed officials before a customary black-out period ahead of their two-day gathering scheduled for Sept. 19-20.

4. Crude reverses losses

Oil prices gained on Friday, paring back earlier losses despite lingering concerns over the health of the crucial Chinese economy and a stronger dollar.

Both benchmarks are on course for weekly gains of around 2%, a rally that has been broadly driven by news that top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia have extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Additionally, data released late Thursday showed that U.S. inventories shrank a hefty 6.3 million barrels in the week to September 1, falling for the fourth consecutive week.

By 05:54 ET, the futures traded 0.2% higher at $87.08 a barrel, while the contract added 0.4% to $90.25 per barrel.

5. Yellen addresses China slowdown

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen predicted that China's sputtering post-pandemic recovery will likely not take a major toll on the American economy, but could hit east Asian countries hard.

In a speech at the G20 summit of world leaders in India, Yellen said she does not see China's downturn having a ""very significant direct impact"" on the U.S., although she noted that Washington is monitoring the situation closely.

Yellen added that Beijing does have ""policy space"" to help reignite growth in the world's second largest economy, which has been slammed by contracting exports, a weakening manufacturing industry and a property sector liquidity crisis.

China has yet to roll out large-scale stimulus measures despite increasing calls to do so. Officials have instead opted to introduce measures to prop up specific industries or support the local currency, which finished its domestic session on Friday at its weakest level since the global financial crisis."

""AMOS was first advertised in April 2022 as a stealer for Mac OS with a strong focus on crypto assets, capable of harvesting passwords from browsers and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s keychain, as well as featuring a file grabber. The developer has been actively working on the project, releasing a new version at the end of June,"" the researchers said.

Criminals who purchase the toolkit distribute the malware primarily through cracked software downloads, but they also impersonate legitimate websites and use ads on search engines such as Google to lure victims in.

According to the report, users who want to download a new programme naturally go to Google and search for it. Threat actors are purchasing advertisements that look like well-known brands and tricking victims into visiting their site as if it were the official one.

Once the user clicks the link, they are presented with a normal-looking page. The attackers create a near-perfect clone of the website users expect, so they click through and download the software.

After opening the file, a fake prompt for the system password appears repeatedly until the user relents and enters their password.

It then extracts as much information as it can from the user's Keychain, file system, and crypto wallets and sends it to the malware's operator, the report explained.

German consumer prices rise in August

Media reports said that Beijing ordered central government officials to not use iPhones for official purposes, while state-owned companies and government agencies were also considering similar moves.

The restrictions point to a potential slowdown in Apple’s iPhone sales, which are the company’s biggest revenue driver. China is also the third-biggest contributor to Apple’s revenue, as of its second-quarter earnings.

Recently, some U.S. lawmakers also called on a blanket ban on tech exports to China, citing a breach of recent trade restrictions by two companies- Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK: ).

China has been a growing point of pain for Apple over the past year, with civil unrest at a major iPhone factory having disrupted production in late-2022. The move had seen Apple attempt to shift more iPhone production to India, to limited success."

“The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,” Citizen Lab said in a statement late on Thursday.

They refered to the exploit chain as ‘BLASTPASS’. The exploit involved PassKit attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim.

Citizen Lab immediately disclosed our findings to Apple and assisted in their investigation.

Apple issued two CVEs related to this exploit chain (CVE-2022-41064 and CVE-2022-41061).

“We would like to acknowledge The Citizen Lab at The University of Torontoʼs Munk School for their assistance,” said the tech giant.

Citizen Lab has urged everyone to immediately update their devices.

“We encourage everyone who may face increased risk because of who they are or what they do to enable Lockdown Mode,” the researchers said.

Apple’s update will secure devices belonging to regular users, companies, and governments around the globe.

“The 'BLASTPASS' discovery highlights the incredible value to our collective cybersecurity of supporting civil society organizations,” said the watchdog.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,Bitcoin inclusion in balance sheets set to boost institutional adoption,https://in.investing.com/news/bitcoin-inclusion-in-balance-sheets-set-to-boost-institutional-adoption-93CH-3801457,"On Friday, experienced a minor rally, trading above the resistance level of US$26,000, after a week-long fluctuation between US$25,500 and US$26,000. This comes amid reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system. The bank is reportedly developing a digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements, pending approval from U.S. regulators.

Meanwhile on Thursday, a new accounting rule was announced that could see tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) reporting on Bitcoin and other altcoins in their balance sheets. The rule mandates companies to declare their crypto holdings at fair value. This development is expected to attract more institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. Companies can adopt this new standard as early as next year, although it will officially be effective after December 15, 2024.

Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at Cryptio, hailed this decision as a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He further explained that this proposal could assist large corporations that have been hesitant to hold crypto on their balance sheet due to technical complexities.

The new requirement demands that companies make a distinct entry for crypto assets in their balance sheet and ensure annual disclosure of changes in their crypto assets opening and closing balances. However, there are some exemptions such as the immediate conversion of Bitcoin to cash.

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's CEO, welcomed this change stating ""Fair value accounting is coming to Bitcoin. This upgrade to FASB accounting rules eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset.""

This move might also lead to heavyweight companies like Apple including crypto assets in their balance sheet. In 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed owning Bitcoin or when asked about it.

The market is also anticipating a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding BlackRock (NYSE: )'s application to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), submitted on June 15.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,"Intel joins Apple, NVIDIA, others as investor in Arm ahead of anticipated IPO",https://in.investing.com/news/intel-joins-apple-nvidia-others-as-investor-in-arm-ahead-of-anticipated-ipo-93CH-3801436,"Intel (NASDAQ: ) has announced its investment in Arm Holdings, joining other tech giants such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), and Samsung (KS: ). This move signifies a major strategic shift in the semiconductor industry. As SoftBank (TYO: ) prepares for Arm's forthcoming Initial Public Offering (IPO), it has been seeking anchor investments from key industry players.

The decision to invest in Arm underscores its strategic importance to Intel Foundry Services and the Altera FPGA unit. Arm's technology, traditionally used in microcontrollers and smartphones, now powers a wide range of devices including desktops and servers. This broad usage has made collaboration with Arm crucial for Intel to maintain its competitive edge in foundry services.

Stuart Pann, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Foundry Services, elaborated on this during the Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Communacopia & Technology Conference on Thursday. ""The fact that our organization, the IFS organization, is embracing ARM at this level, investing in ARM, doing partnerships with ARM, should give you a signpost that we're absolutely serious about playing in this business because if you're not working with ARM, you can't be a foundries provider,"" Pann explained.

Despite Intel's commitment to its x86 architecture for its core products, collaborations such as these indicate an expanding horizon. The evolving partnership between Intel and Arm may extend into new sectors like client PC and server System-on-Chips (SoCs), marking an exciting phase for the semiconductor industry.

Arm Holdings has been amassing clients, partners, and investors over recent months. As an investor in Arm, Intel will gain better access to the company's future chip design Intellectual Property (IP). Pann also shared that Intel plans to focus on other low-power chipsets to penetrate this market segment further.

In preparation for Arm's IPO, SoftBank plans to offer $95.5 million of shares at $47 to $51 each. The company has already achieved a valuation of $55 billion, according to Bloomberg. With more opportunities emerging through SoftBank, New Street Research's Pierre Ferragu estimates that Arm will be worth $82 billion over the next three years.

The IPO for Arm Holdings Plc is anticipated to take place sometime next week.

This followed a turbulent day on Wall Street where Apple's shares fell more than 3%, influenced by China's decision to expand its iPhone ban on U.S.-made mobile phones for government staff and require citizens to install an anti-fraud app. Investors are now questioning the broader impacts of China's move against foreign electronics.

On Thursday, Wall Street witnessed a decline in stocks due to uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategies and the possibility of an upcoming rate hike. Among the corporate underperformances, Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) dropped by nearly 4% following the news from China. Other companies such as C3.ai and ChargePoint Holdings also experienced share declines after reporting larger anticipated operational losses and missing revenue forecasts respectively.

In contrast, McDonald's (NYSE: ) shares surged after receiving an upgrade from Wells Fargo (NYSE: ). The fast-food giant was declared to have room for margin growth, gaining more than a percent on the market. Meanwhile, a potential merger between WestRock (NYSE: ) and Europe's Smurfit Kappa could lead to the formation of a large paper and packaging entity, valued at approximately $20 billion.

Economic indicators presented a mixed picture. The Labor Department reported initial jobless claims for the week ending on September 2nd stood at a seasonally adjusted 216,000, marking a 13,000 decrease from the prior period. However, unit labor costs spiked by 2.2% in the second quarter, surpassing the expected 1.9%. This increase in labor costs along with a rising nonfarm productivity rate has stirred apprehension that the robust labor market might deter the Federal Reserve from easing its monetary policy.

The market sentiment is cautiously bearish due to uncertainties about Federal Reserve decisions and several corporate underperformances. Investors are advised to proceed with caution in anticipation of potential market turbulence.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Intel shares rise amid industry downturn and positive analyst commentary,https://in.investing.com/news/intel-shares-rise-amid-industry-downturn-and-positive-analyst-commentary-93CH-3801417,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: ) saw an unexpected rise of 3.2% on Thursday, despite a broad sell-off in most semiconductor stocks due to escalating U.S.-China tensions. This follows reports from Wednesday that China may ban government agencies from using iPhones, triggering a sell-off not only in Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) but also among its suppliers and other semiconductor equipment stocks.

While some analysts have termed these worries as ""overblown"", Intel has historically seen gains during such periods of U.S.-China tension. Despite having China exposure through its PC and data center processors, Intel is building out a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem it hopes will rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). There is speculation that Intel could significantly benefit if chip designers pivot to Intel's foundries in the event of a destabilizing situation in Taiwan.

In addition to this, Intel received positive analyst commentary on the very day regarding its emerging foundry ecosystem. At an industry conference at the end of August, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had received a large pre-payment for its foundry ecosystem. Specifically, the pre-payment was for 18A, the leading-edge 1.8nm fab Intel plans on bringing online at the end of 2024. This fab is expected to produce chips that will regain process-node parity with, or even leadership over, TSMC.

Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted on Thursday that the pre-payment likely came from a ""whale"", referring to an extremely large chipmaker that is likely a leader in its market. This could be seen as a promising vote of confidence in Intel's fledgling foundry and could play a key role in its turnaround.

Leading chip designers such as Apple and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) would probably like an alternative foundry partner to manufacture their chips other than TSMC, which has increased prices over the past few years due to its leadership position. Moreover, Intel could especially benefit if customers become nervous about U.S.-China relations, which could potentially lead to an attempted invasion of Taiwan.

Gelsinger also noted that Intel's current quarter was tracking above the mid-point of guidance, indicating a potential bottom in the PC market. Intel's roadmap to catch up to TSMC appears on track, and there is growing interest in Intel's Max and Gaudi AI accelerators, which have the potential to carve out some share of the booming AI market.

Ltd (NYSE:TSM), commonly known as TSMC, traded lower by approximately 2.9% to $89.56 on Thursday, amid a broader downturn in the tech sector driven by rate hike fears following U.S. jobs data. Additional pressure on semiconductor and chip stocks came from China's crackdown on iPhones and the launch of Huawei's 5G Kirin 9000s chip-powered smartphone.

TSMC, a major semiconductor foundry and key supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: ), is feeling the impact of these developments. A significant portion of TSMC's business is tied to Apple, making China's expanding ban on iPhones in sensitive departments - including government-backed agencies and state companies - a concern for both companies. This move by China signals increasing difficulties for Apple in its largest foreign market and global production hub, potentially affecting TSMC's revenue.

The ban follows the launch of Apple's latest iPhone model and is part of Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on American technology. These efforts have been further fueled by U.S. sanctions on China over semiconductor technology and attempts to reduce supply chain dependence on China.

Despite these challenges, TSMC continues to innovate in chip technology, preparing for the production of 3nm and 2nm chips that could redefine the semiconductor landscape. Analysts have set a target price for TSMC stock at $117.01 per share, while a more conservative analysis based on cash flows suggests an intrinsic value closer to $105 per share.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, TSMC shares have traded between a 52-week low of $59.43 and a high of $110.69.

(NASDAQ: ) with a 12-month price target of $210.00.

In the past few days, Apple's stock has faced downward pressure due to ongoing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. In a recent development, it was announced that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) instructed employees against using Apple iPhones or other foreign devices for their professional tasks.

Analysts write in a note, “China represents around 19% of Apple revenue and we think it skews heavily towards the iPhone and App Store. The iPhone dominates the high-end smartphone category in China and significant share gains in the market in recent years have helped iPhone revenue outperform expectations.”

The extent of the impact remains uncertain, as it's likely that party officials had already refrained from using American products in their workplace long before the official ban was implemented.

“We think this is more of a headline issues vs. something that will have a material impact on financial performance given government officials were likely already avoiding Apple products,” added the analysts.

The ban has been in effect to a certain degree for some time now. Even if it were to be extended to encompass strategically significant SOEs with a substantial workforce, potentially including hundreds of thousands of employees with significant spending power, Evercore anticipates that the scope of this restriction would primarily apply to top-level individuals responsible for strategic planning and decision-making within these organizations.

Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the order, which also prohibits government workers from bringing these smartphones into the office, had been handed down in recent weeks. It was not immediately clear how widely the directives were being distributed, the WSJ said.

Traders seemingly took the report as a signal that China may be willing to reduce its reliance on American companies in its bid to boost domestic tech players. This could prove to be a blow to Apple's Chinese operations, which generate almost a fifth of the company's total revenue.

Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE: ) warned in a note to clients that China's ban could have a ""5 million to 10 million unit headwind"" on iPhone shipments. China currently accounts for roughly 40M to 50M iPhone units for Apple, they added.

Meanwhile, Apple rival Huawei's new mobile gadget capable of ultrafast data connectivity may also weigh on iPhone sales in China, analysts at Oppenheimer flagged.

“The government ban and the new Huawei phone will be material events for the iPhone,” the Oppenheimer analysts said. “The two combined will drive more Android users to upgrade to the Huawei, or iPhone users going back to Huawei.”

The analysts, who maintained an Overweight rating and $215 price target on the tech giant's shares, said despite concerns about a muted iPhone 15 cycle, they believe iPhone revenue will increase due to a growing installed base, easy year-over-year comps, pent-up demand, and a positive mix shift driving ASP growth.

""iPhone pricing will be the most important detail at Apple's Sept 12th event,"" said the analysts. ""While the iPhone event has historically been a 'sell-the-news' event, we continue to see upside to Consensus and buyside expectations as FY24 tailwinds outweigh the headwinds.""

They laid out several reasons they believe iPhone revenue will grow in FY24, including the fact it forecasts 4% Y/Y growth in Apple's primary, active installed base in FY24, Apple facing easy Y/Y compares, the pent-up demand from consumers deferring their iPhone purchase from FY23, a slight form factor change, emerging markets being an underappreciated tailwind, the continued positive mix shift to Apple's higher-end SKUs, and targeted pricing increases at the high-end of the portfolio.

""We believe that as FY24 iPhone expectations move higher, Apple can continue to outperform, as positive estimate revisions offset very moderate multiple compression,"" said the Morgan Stanley analysts.

""We don't believe investors need to be aggressive into next week's event, but we'd be buyers on any material underperformance post-launch,"" they concluded."
2022-09-07, IANS,Huawei’s shift to Kirin processors to hurt Qualcomm the most: Top analyst,https://in.investing.com/news/huaweis-shift-to-kirin-processors-to-hurt-qualcomm-the-most-top-analyst-3800759,"New Delhi, Sep 7 (IANS) Chinese smartphone brand Huawei’s new smartphones will fully adopt the new self-developed Kirin processors starting in 2024, a move that will hurt chip-maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) the most, according to leading analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.According to Kuo, Qualcomm will not only lose Huawei’s orders completely from 2024 onwards “but also face the risk of a decline in shipments to non-Huawei Chinese brand clients due to the competition from Huawei”.

Huawei purchased 23-25 ​​million and 40-42 million mobile phone SoCs from Qualcomm in 2022 and 2022, respectively.

“However, it’s expected that Huawei’s new models will fully adopt the new self-developed Kirin processors starting in 2024,” said said Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group in the Asia-Pacific region.

Qualcomm’s SoC shipments to Chinese smartphone brands in 2024 are expected to be at least 50-60 million units lower than in 2022 due to Huawei’s adoption of the new Kirin processors and will continue to decline year by year.

“My latest survey indicates that Qualcomm will likely start a price war as early as 4Q23 to maintain market share in the Chinese market, which will be detrimental to profits,” Kuo emphasised.

Two other potential risks for Qualcomm are that the market share of Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) mobile phones is higher than expected and Apple (NASDAQ: ) is expected to use its own modem chip starting in 2025.

Huawei and China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) built an advanced 7-nanometer processor to power its latest smartphones, according to a report by market analysis firm TechInsights.

It is reported that Huawei is using a homemade advanced 7nm chipset, identified as Kirin 9000s, in its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

The company started selling its Mate 60 Pro phone last week, without much information about the chipset inside.

2022-09-07, IANS,Apple slides as China plans to broaden iPhone ban,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-slides-as-china-plans-to-broaden-iphone-ban-3800757,"New York, Sep 7 (IANS) Apple shares fell in the early pre-market hours in New York on another report outlining China's plan to broaden an iPhone ban for certain government departments, state-backed agencies, and firms as the tech war with the US progressively worsens, Zero Hedge reported.Beijing plans to broaden iPhone restrictions to a number of state-owned companies and other government-affiliated entities, according to Bloomberg, citing sources who requested anonymity due to the delicate nature of the topic.

The report builds on Wednesday's Wall Street Journal story of how iPhone ""restrictions are the latest step in Beijing's campaign to reduce reliance on overseas technology.”

“Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations,"" the people said, as per the report.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) were down 2.71 per cent during pre-market hours in New York, breaking down below its 100DMA.

Trading action on Wednesday recorded the largest daily loss in a month over the WSJ's report. European chip-makers, including Apple supplier STMicroelectronics NV, also dropped on Thursday, Zero Hedge reported.

It's unclear how many government agencies and state-owned firms were impacted by the new restrictions, but what's clear is that Beijing's campaign to cut reliance on Western technology is full steam ahead -- and could erode Apple's market share in one of its largest markets where 19% of total revenue is derived from, the report said.

The people added state firms or organizations would likely ban Apple devices from the workplace, while others could entirely ban employees from owning these devices.

News of the broadening iPhone ban comes one week after Huawei launched a new smartphone powered by an advanced 7-nanometer processor chip, a sign that Beijing's push to circumvent US efforts to crush its semiconductor industry via sanctions is failing, Zero Hedge reported.

Beijing purging Western devices from government officials at work and critical state-run companies suggests this is a move to revive Huawei's smartphone businesses, it added.

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analyst lowered the price target on Apple (NASDAQ: ) to $230.00 (from $235.00) while maintaining a Overweight rating.

The analyst comments ""Heading into the Apple’s fall product launch next week, the key investor questions we are getting are: 1) the materiality of the product cycle upgrades; 2) pricing actions and resulting volume outlook; and 3) implications of macro headwinds, including restrictions in China. While we discuss our views relative to those key questions in more detail below, we believe share price outperformance in the remainder of the year (particularly after a strong outperformance in 1H and underperformance between July and September) is dependent on beating what are now low investor expectations for the iPhone 15 launch. However, even in the case of iPhone revenue/volume expectations following the launch meeting/beating low investor expectations, the magnitude of the upside to shares in the remainder of the year is going to be limited by the outperformance YTD as well as an earnings multiple that is at an ~61% premium to 2H of 2019 when AAPL shares outperformed in a similar fashion by meeting/beating low investor expectations for the iPhone 11 cycle."""

We believe Mate 60 technology is still 2-3 years behind iPhone with limited production capacity. China is ~20% of total iPhones, however, India with 1.5B population and ~5% middle class is the bigger incremental opportunity for Apple, in our view.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the contract in Germany traded 0.4% higher, in France climbed 0.3% and the contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.

These major cash indices are all on course to register losses this week, while the pan-European benchmark index has fallen for seven straight days, its worst string of losses since February 2018.

German consumer prices rise in August

This represented a minor slowing from the 6.2% annual increase the previous month, which could pressure ECB policymakers to hike interest rates once more next week given inflation in the eurozone’s largest economy remains more than three times higher than the central bank’s medium-term 2% target.

Japanese 2Q growth revised lower

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has seen about $200 billion wiped from its market capitalisation in two days on reports of China curbing iPhone use by state employees.

This comes ahead of an event next week where the world’s most valuable company is expected to unveil its iPhone 15 line-up.

Crude weakens but still on course for positive week

Oil prices retreated Friday, falling further from the 10-month peaks seen earlier in the week on concerns about the health of the crucial Chinese economy and weighed by a strong dollar.

Media reports said that Beijing ordered central government officials to not use iPhones for official purposes, while state-owned companies and government agencies were also considering similar moves.

The restrictions point to a potential slowdown in Apple’s iPhone sales, which are the company’s biggest revenue driver. China is also the third-biggest contributor to Apple’s revenue, as of its second-quarter earnings.

Apple is also set to launch its new range of iPhone 15 phones later this month.

Reports of the ban saw Apple’s shares tumble about 6% over the past two sessions, wiping out roughly $200 billion from the iPhone maker’s market capitalization.

Losses in Apple spilled over into its Asian suppliers, with South Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS: ), which supplies memory chips to the firm, down 4.1%. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), which supplies memory chips and phone displays to Apple, fell 0.9%.

Taiwan’s TSMC (TW: ) (NYSE: ) fell 0.7%, while display maker Japan Display Inc (TYO: ) slid 2.5%. In China, Luxshare Precision Industry Co Ltd (SZ: ), which makes connector cables for a slew of Apple devices, slid 3.2%.

Hong Kong-listed supplier AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK: ), which builds Airpods for Apple, was down nearly 6% this week, although the stock did not trade on Friday due to a broader trade suspension in Hong Kong.

Beijing’s restrictions on the iPhone come amid worsening relations with the U.S., and could be potentially retaliatory measures for recent restrictions on technology exports to China.

Recently, some U.S. lawmakers also called on a blanket ban on tech exports to China, citing a breach of recent trade restrictions by two companies- Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (HK: ).

China has been a growing point of pain for Apple over the past year, with civil unrest at a major iPhone factory having disrupted production in late-2022. The move had seen Apple attempt to shift more iPhone production to India, to limited success."

“The exploit chain was capable of compromising iPhones running the latest version of iOS (16.6) without any interaction from the victim,” Citizen Lab said in a statement late on Thursday.

They refered to the exploit chain as ‘BLASTPASS’. The exploit involved PassKit attachments containing malicious images sent from an attacker iMessage account to the victim.

Citizen Lab immediately disclosed our findings to Apple and assisted in their investigation.

Apple issued two CVEs related to this exploit chain (CVE-2022-41064 and CVE-2022-41061).

This comes amid reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system. The bank is reportedly developing a digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements, pending approval from U.S. regulators.

Meanwhile on Thursday, a new accounting rule was announced that could see tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) reporting on Bitcoin and other altcoins in their balance sheets. The rule mandates companies to declare their crypto holdings at fair value. This development is expected to attract more institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. Companies can adopt this new standard as early as next year, although it will officially be effective after December 15, 2024.

Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at Cryptio, hailed this decision as a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He further explained that this proposal could assist large corporations that have been hesitant to hold crypto on their balance sheet due to technical complexities.

The new requirement demands that companies make a distinct entry for crypto assets in their balance sheet and ensure annual disclosure of changes in their crypto assets opening and closing balances. However, there are some exemptions such as the immediate conversion of Bitcoin to cash.

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's CEO, welcomed this change stating ""Fair value accounting is coming to Bitcoin. This upgrade to FASB accounting rules eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset.""

This move might also lead to heavyweight companies like Apple including crypto assets in their balance sheet. In 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed owning Bitcoin or when asked about it.

The market is also anticipating a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding BlackRock (NYSE: )'s application to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), submitted on June 15.

This move signifies a major strategic shift in the semiconductor industry. As SoftBank (TYO: ) prepares for Arm's forthcoming Initial Public Offering (IPO), it has been seeking anchor investments from key industry players.

The decision to invest in Arm underscores its strategic importance to Intel Foundry Services and the Altera FPGA unit. Arm's technology, traditionally used in microcontrollers and smartphones, now powers a wide range of devices including desktops and servers. This broad usage has made collaboration with Arm crucial for Intel to maintain its competitive edge in foundry services.

Stuart Pann, senior vice president and general manager of Intel Foundry Services, elaborated on this during the Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) Communacopia & Technology Conference on Thursday. ""The fact that our organization, the IFS organization, is embracing ARM at this level, investing in ARM, doing partnerships with ARM, should give you a signpost that we're absolutely serious about playing in this business because if you're not working with ARM, you can't be a foundries provider,"" Pann explained.

Despite Intel's commitment to its x86 architecture for its core products, collaborations such as these indicate an expanding horizon. The evolving partnership between Intel and Arm may extend into new sectors like client PC and server System-on-Chips (SoCs), marking an exciting phase for the semiconductor industry.

Arm Holdings has been amassing clients, partners, and investors over recent months. As an investor in Arm, Intel will gain better access to the company's future chip design Intellectual Property (IP). Pann also shared that Intel plans to focus on other low-power chipsets to penetrate this market segment further.

In preparation for Arm's IPO, SoftBank plans to offer $95.5 million of shares at $47 to $51 each. The company has already achieved a valuation of $55 billion, according to Bloomberg. With more opportunities emerging through SoftBank, New Street Research's Pierre Ferragu estimates that Arm will be worth $82 billion over the next three years.

The IPO for Arm Holdings Plc is anticipated to take place sometime next week.

This followed a turbulent day on Wall Street where Apple's shares fell more than 3%, influenced by China's decision to expand its iPhone ban on U.S.-made mobile phones for government staff and require citizens to install an anti-fraud app. Investors are now questioning the broader impacts of China's move against foreign electronics.

On Thursday, Wall Street witnessed a decline in stocks due to uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate strategies and the possibility of an upcoming rate hike. Among the corporate underperformances, Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) dropped by nearly 4% following the news from China. Other companies such as C3.ai and ChargePoint Holdings also experienced share declines after reporting larger anticipated operational losses and missing revenue forecasts respectively.

In contrast, McDonald's (NYSE: ) shares surged after receiving an upgrade from Wells Fargo (NYSE: ). The fast-food giant was declared to have room for margin growth, gaining more than a percent on the market. Meanwhile, a potential merger between WestRock (NYSE: ) and Europe's Smurfit Kappa could lead to the formation of a large paper and packaging entity, valued at approximately $20 billion.

Economic indicators presented a mixed picture. The Labor Department reported initial jobless claims for the week ending on September 2nd stood at a seasonally adjusted 216,000, marking a 13,000 decrease from the prior period. However, unit labor costs spiked by 2.2% in the second quarter, surpassing the expected 1.9%. This increase in labor costs along with a rising nonfarm productivity rate has stirred apprehension that the robust labor market might deter the Federal Reserve from easing its monetary policy.

The market sentiment is cautiously bearish due to uncertainties about Federal Reserve decisions and several corporate underperformances. Investors are advised to proceed with caution in anticipation of potential market turbulence.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Intel shares rise amid industry downturn and positive analyst commentary,https://in.investing.com/news/intel-shares-rise-amid-industry-downturn-and-positive-analyst-commentary-93CH-3801417,"Shares of Intel (NASDAQ: ) saw an unexpected rise of 3.2% on Thursday, despite a broad sell-off in most semiconductor stocks due to escalating U.S.-China tensions. This follows reports from Wednesday that China may ban government agencies from using iPhones, triggering a sell-off not only in Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) but also among its suppliers and other semiconductor equipment stocks.

While some analysts have termed these worries as ""overblown"", Intel has historically seen gains during such periods of U.S.-China tension. Despite having China exposure through its PC and data center processors, Intel is building out a U.S.-based foundry ecosystem it hopes will rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM). There is speculation that Intel could significantly benefit if chip designers pivot to Intel's foundries in the event of a destabilizing situation in Taiwan.

In addition to this, Intel received positive analyst commentary on the very day regarding its emerging foundry ecosystem. At an industry conference at the end of August, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger announced that the company had received a large pre-payment for its foundry ecosystem. Specifically, the pre-payment was for 18A, the leading-edge 1.8nm fab Intel plans on bringing online at the end of 2024. This fab is expected to produce chips that will regain process-node parity with, or even leadership over, TSMC.

Citi analyst Christopher Danely noted on Thursday that the pre-payment likely came from a ""whale"", referring to an extremely large chipmaker that is likely a leader in its market. This could be seen as a promising vote of confidence in Intel's fledgling foundry and could play a key role in its turnaround.

Leading chip designers such as Apple and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) would probably like an alternative foundry partner to manufacture their chips other than TSMC, which has increased prices over the past few years due to its leadership position. Moreover, Intel could especially benefit if customers become nervous about U.S.-China relations, which could potentially lead to an attempted invasion of Taiwan.

Gelsinger also noted that Intel's current quarter was tracking above the mid-point of guidance, indicating a potential bottom in the PC market. Intel's roadmap to catch up to TSMC appears on track, and there is growing interest in Intel's Max and Gaudi AI accelerators, which have the potential to carve out some share of the booming AI market.

Economic data released on Thursday added to market jitters.

Ltd (NYSE:TSM), commonly known as TSMC, traded lower by approximately 2.9% to $89.56 on Thursday, amid a broader downturn in the tech sector driven by rate hike fears following U.S. jobs data. Additional pressure on semiconductor and chip stocks came from China's crackdown on iPhones and the launch of Huawei's 5G Kirin 9000s chip-powered smartphone.

TSMC, a major semiconductor foundry and key supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: ), is feeling the impact of these developments. A significant portion of TSMC's business is tied to Apple, making China's expanding ban on iPhones in sensitive departments - including government-backed agencies and state companies - a concern for both companies. This move by China signals increasing difficulties for Apple in its largest foreign market and global production hub, potentially affecting TSMC's revenue.

The ban follows the launch of Apple's latest iPhone model and is part of Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on American technology. These efforts have been further fueled by U.S. sanctions on China over semiconductor technology and attempts to reduce supply chain dependence on China.

Despite these challenges, TSMC continues to innovate in chip technology, preparing for the production of 3nm and 2nm chips that could redefine the semiconductor landscape. Analysts have set a target price for TSMC stock at $117.01 per share, while a more conservative analysis based on cash flows suggests an intrinsic value closer to $105 per share.

According to data from Benzinga Pro, TSMC shares have traded between a 52-week low of $59.43 and a high of $110.69.

(NASDAQ: ) with a 12-month price target of $210.00.

In the past few days, Apple's stock has faced downward pressure due to ongoing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. In a recent development, it was announced that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) instructed employees against using Apple iPhones or other foreign devices for their professional tasks.

Analysts write in a note, “China represents around 19% of Apple revenue and we think it skews heavily towards the iPhone and App Store. The iPhone dominates the high-end smartphone category in China and significant share gains in the market in recent years have helped iPhone revenue outperform expectations.”

The extent of the impact remains uncertain, as it's likely that party officials had already refrained from using American products in their workplace long before the official ban was implemented.

“We think this is more of a headline issues vs. something that will have a material impact on financial performance given government officials were likely already avoiding Apple products,” added the analysts.

The ban has been in effect to a certain degree for some time now. Even if it were to be extended to encompass strategically significant SOEs with a substantial workforce, potentially including hundreds of thousands of employees with significant spending power, Evercore anticipates that the scope of this restriction would primarily apply to top-level individuals responsible for strategic planning and decision-making within these organizations.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Apple extends drop after reported China ban on iPhone use by government officials,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-extends-drop-after-reported-china-ban-on-iphone-use-by-government-officials-3800921,"Investing.com -- Shares in Apple (NASDAQ: ) fell in early U.S. trading on Thursday, as a decline in the stock stretched into a second straight day following a report that China had banned government officials from using the tech giant's iPhone and other foreign-branded devices for work.

Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday that the order, which also prohibits government workers from bringing these smartphones into the office, had been handed down in recent weeks. It was not immediately clear how widely the directives were being distributed, the WSJ said.

Traders seemingly took the report as a signal that China may be willing to reduce its reliance on American companies in its bid to boost domestic tech players. This could prove to be a blow to Apple's Chinese operations, which generate almost a fifth of the company's total revenue.

Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE: ) warned in a note to clients that China's ban could have a ""5 million to 10 million unit headwind"" on iPhone shipments. China currently accounts for roughly 40M to 50M iPhone units for Apple, they added.

Meanwhile, Apple rival Huawei's new mobile gadget capable of ultrafast data connectivity may also weigh on iPhone sales in China, analysts at Oppenheimer flagged.

The analysts, who maintained an Overweight rating and $215 price target on the tech giant's shares, said despite concerns about a muted iPhone 15 cycle, they believe iPhone revenue will increase due to a growing installed base, easy year-over-year comps, pent-up demand, and a positive mix shift driving ASP growth.

""iPhone pricing will be the most important detail at Apple's Sept 12th event,"" said the analysts. ""While the iPhone event has historically been a 'sell-the-news' event, we continue to see upside to Consensus and buyside expectations as FY24 tailwinds outweigh the headwinds.""

They laid out several reasons they believe iPhone revenue will grow in FY24, including the fact it forecasts 4% Y/Y growth in Apple's primary, active installed base in FY24, Apple facing easy Y/Y compares, the pent-up demand from consumers deferring their iPhone purchase from FY23, a slight form factor change, emerging markets being an underappreciated tailwind, the continued positive mix shift to Apple's higher-end SKUs, and targeted pricing increases at the high-end of the portfolio.

""We believe that as FY24 iPhone expectations move higher, Apple can continue to outperform, as positive estimate revisions offset very moderate multiple compression,"" said the Morgan Stanley analysts.

2022-09-07, IANS,Huawei’s shift to Kirin processors to hurt Qualcomm the most: Top analyst,https://in.investing.com/news/huaweis-shift-to-kirin-processors-to-hurt-qualcomm-the-most-top-analyst-3800759,"New Delhi, Sep 7 (IANS) Chinese smartphone brand Huawei’s new smartphones will fully adopt the new self-developed Kirin processors starting in 2024, a move that will hurt chip-maker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) the most, according to leading analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.According to Kuo, Qualcomm will not only lose Huawei’s orders completely from 2024 onwards “but also face the risk of a decline in shipments to non-Huawei Chinese brand clients due to the competition from Huawei”.

Huawei purchased 23-25 ​​million and 40-42 million mobile phone SoCs from Qualcomm in 2022 and 2022, respectively.

“However, it’s expected that Huawei’s new models will fully adopt the new self-developed Kirin processors starting in 2024,” said said Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group in the Asia-Pacific region.

Qualcomm’s SoC shipments to Chinese smartphone brands in 2024 are expected to be at least 50-60 million units lower than in 2022 due to Huawei’s adoption of the new Kirin processors and will continue to decline year by year.

“My latest survey indicates that Qualcomm will likely start a price war as early as 4Q23 to maintain market share in the Chinese market, which will be detrimental to profits,” Kuo emphasised.

Two other potential risks for Qualcomm are that the market share of Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) mobile phones is higher than expected and Apple (NASDAQ: ) is expected to use its own modem chip starting in 2025.

Huawei and China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) built an advanced 7-nanometer processor to power its latest smartphones, according to a report by market analysis firm TechInsights.

It is reported that Huawei is using a homemade advanced 7nm chipset, identified as Kirin 9000s, in its Mate 60 Pro smartphone.

The company started selling its Mate 60 Pro phone last week, without much information about the chipset inside.

2022-09-07, IANS,Apple slides as China plans to broaden iPhone ban,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-slides-as-china-plans-to-broaden-iphone-ban-3800757,"New York, Sep 7 (IANS) Apple shares fell in the early pre-market hours in New York on another report outlining China's plan to broaden an iPhone ban for certain government departments, state-backed agencies, and firms as the tech war with the US progressively worsens, Zero Hedge reported.Beijing plans to broaden iPhone restrictions to a number of state-owned companies and other government-affiliated entities, according to Bloomberg, citing sources who requested anonymity due to the delicate nature of the topic.

The report builds on Wednesday's Wall Street Journal story of how iPhone ""restrictions are the latest step in Beijing's campaign to reduce reliance on overseas technology.”

“Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations,"" the people said, as per the report.

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) were down 2.71 per cent during pre-market hours in New York, breaking down below its 100DMA.

Trading action on Wednesday recorded the largest daily loss in a month over the WSJ's report. European chip-makers, including Apple supplier STMicroelectronics NV, also dropped on Thursday, Zero Hedge reported.

It's unclear how many government agencies and state-owned firms were impacted by the new restrictions, but what's clear is that Beijing's campaign to cut reliance on Western technology is full steam ahead -- and could erode Apple's market share in one of its largest markets where 19% of total revenue is derived from, the report said.

The people added state firms or organizations would likely ban Apple devices from the workplace, while others could entirely ban employees from owning these devices.

News of the broadening iPhone ban comes one week after Huawei launched a new smartphone powered by an advanced 7-nanometer processor chip, a sign that Beijing's push to circumvent US efforts to crush its semiconductor industry via sanctions is failing, Zero Hedge reported.

Beijing purging Western devices from government officials at work and critical state-run companies suggests this is a move to revive Huawei's smartphone businesses, it added.

“Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,” they wrote in a report to clients.

Companies that integrate generative AI into their business practices can benefit from faster product and content introductions, leading to higher revenues and 20-30% lower costs, according to the analysts.

“In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, tech-enhanced competitors will put companies out of business that aren't equally tech-first, in our view.

Shares in the tech behemoth fell 3.6% yesterday on the WSJ report that China is expanding its ban on iPhones to state-owned firms and government agencies.

Apple stock is down a further 2.7% in premarket Thursday.

China Government Ban

The situation in China has developed as the government ordered officials at central government agencies not to use iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office. These instructions were reportedly communicated to staff by their superiors in workplace chat groups or meetings, the WSJ report noted.

The potential expansion of the iPhone ban in China could have significant implications for foreign brands operating in the country, including Apple.

China is crucial for Apple, and the company relies on this market for approximately 19% of its overall revenue.

“China accounts for roughly 40-50mn iPhone units for Apple. We estimate up to a 5mn to 10mn-unit headwind if such a ban were to go through and subsequently be enforced. Additionally, if iPhones are banned from being carried into official workplaces (the Journal article suggests this as well), the impact could be higher given the high propensity of Chinese consumers to own and carry multiple phones,” BofA analysts wrote in a client note.

“We estimate that every 1mn iPhones translates to about a penny in EPS. The prior foreign branded laptop ban announced in 2022 allowed for a 2-year time frame to comply. It remains unclear what the timing of this potential ban would be.”

Increased competition

Moreover, Apple’s China rival Huawei introduced a new smartphone capable of ultrafast data connectivity. This, in addition to the government ban, could weigh on Apple’s iPhone sales in China.

“The government ban and the new Huawei phone will be material events for the iPhone,” said analysts at Oppenheimer. “The two combined will drive more Android users to upgrade to the Huawei, or iPhone users going back to Huawei.”

According to the analysts, Apple could lose 10 million iPhone shipments in 2024 because of the new Huawei phone. Coupled with lost shipments due to the government ban in China, Apple could be looking at 15-20 million in lost iPhone shipments for the next year.

The launch of the Mate 60 Pro, priced at $960 for presale, comes just a few days before Apple is scheduled to release its iPhone 15 lineup.

BofA analysts added that the timing of the potential ban is “interesting” as it coincides with the launch of Huawei's new high-end smartphone."

Elsewhere, China's exports contract in August in a sign of mounting pressure on the manufacturing industry in the world's second biggest economy, while a report that Beijing is barring government officials from using iPhones at work weighed on Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares.

1. Futures mixed following Wednesday slide

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Thursday after stronger-than-anticipated U.S. services sector data sent Treasury yields higher and weighed on equities in the prior session.

At 05:40 ET (09:40 GMT), the contract added 41 points or 0.1%, the contract lost 9 points or 0.2%, and dipped by 87 points or 0.6%.

Monthly data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed that -- which makes up more than two-thirds of the American economy -- unexpectedly accelerated in August, hitting a six-month high. paid by these businesses also rose.

The numbers suggested that consumer demand is shrugging off a recent spike in interest rates -- a resilience that analysts at ING posited could be linked to a summer of popular concerts and movies. After the release of the figures, yields in both two- and ten-year U.S. government bonds climbed, while all three of the major indices on Wall Street declined.

2. Fed survey points to modest economic growth

The services data fueled some bets that the Federal Reserve may choose to hike interest rates later this year to stamp out the stubborn final embers of last year's surge in price gains.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , the probability that America's central bank will choose to raise rates at its November meeting now stands at 43.6%, up from 39.3% in the prior day.

Investors, however, are still largely pricing in the chance that the Fed will keep borrowing costs steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% for the remainder of 2022. The predictions were largely supported by a on Wednesday that pointed to modest growth and cooling inflation in the world's biggest economy in July and August.

The so-called ""Beige Book"" summary bolstered expectations that, even accounting for the expanding services industry, Fed policymakers were either done or wrapping up their long-standing tightening campaign.

More clues about the path ahead for rates may come on Thursday from a fintech conference where a number of Fed officials are due to speak.

3. Crude slips on weak Chinese trade data

Oil prices fell Thursday, climbing down from 10-month peaks as more signs of slowing Chinese growth overshadowed another draw in U.S. inventories that hinted at tightening supplies.

Weak trade figures out of China were seen as a signal that the world's largest crude importer is at risk of missing Beijing's annual growth target of about 5% (see below).

Meanwhile, data released late Wednesday by the industry body American Petroleum Institute showed inventories fell for a fourth straight week, dropping 5.5 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 1. The reading usually acts as a precursor to inventory data from the Energy Information Administration, which is due later in the day.

By 05:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $86.83 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.8% to $89.92.

4. Chinese exports slump

China's dropped by 8.8% annually in August, while contracted by 7.3%, in a fresh sign of the significant pressure on the country's crucial manufacturing sector.

Although the trade numbers on Thursday topped estimates, they still indicate that government policymakers may need to do more to help shore up China's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.

Along with flagging exports, China's economy has been hit by a liquidity crisis in its property sector. Officials in Beijing have rolled out a series of smaller measures aimed at buttressing growth, but have yet to launch a wide-scale stimulus program.

Yet the woes were not confined to Asia. Industrial production in Germany fell by more than anticipated in July, exacerbating concerns that the eurozone's largest economy and major regional growth driver may be about to slip back into recession.

5. China bars government officials from using iPhones at work - WSJ

Shares in Apple decreased by just under 3.6% on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that China has banned government officials from using the tech giant's popular iPhone and other foreign-branded devices for work.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Huawei's new Mate 60 series challenges Qualcomm's market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/huaweis-new-mate-60-series-challenges-qualcomms-market-dominance-93CH-3800378,"On Thursday, Huawei unveiled its new Mate 60 series of smartphones, featuring the company's own 5G Kirin 9000s chipset manufactured by SMIC on a 7nm process node. The move marks a significant shift for Huawei, which has previously been a major customer of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that this development could pose a serious threat to Qualcomm's dominance in the market. In 2022, Huawei purchased between 23 million and 25 million mobile phone System-on-Chips (SoCs) from Qualcomm, and this figure increased to 40-42 million in 2022. Kuo projects that Qualcomm's SoC shipments to Chinese smartphone brands could reduce by at least 50–60 million units in 2024 due to Huawei’s adoption of the new Kirin processors.

In response to this competition, Qualcomm may initiate a price war as early as Q4 2022 to maintain its market share in China, potentially impacting its profits. Kuo also highlighted two other potential risks for Qualcomm: an increase in the market share of the Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) mobile phones and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s expected shift to its own modem chip in 2025.

The Kirin 9000S chip is not expected to match up with the most powerful Snapdragon SoC in performance or efficiency. However, it signifies Huawei's resilience despite the US trade ban restricting the company from receiving any American 5G technology.

Qualcomm's next flagship chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, is expected to cost $180 per unit. If the company loses approximately 60 million Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 shipments, as projected by Kuo, this could translate into a loss of roughly $10.8 billion.

While Huawei has not yet announced plans to release Kirin SoCs to other Chinese phone makers, should it decide to do so, it is likely that these chips would be cheaper than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. As such, Qualcomm also needs to consider competition from Samsung's Exynos 2400 set to debut with the Galaxy S24 lineup.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Apple plans to use self-developed 5G modems by 2025,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-plans-to-use-selfdeveloped-5g-modems-by-2025-93CH-3800090,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly planning to transition to in-house 5G modems for its iPhones by 2025, a move that would reduce the tech giant's dependency on current supplier Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ). The first iPhone model to feature Apple's self-developed modem could be the iPhone SE 4th generation, according to renowned Apple Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

The company has been working on its own network modem for over five years, having acquired Intel’s Modem division in 2019. Despite this acquisition, Apple continues to rely on Qualcomm for 5G-enabled modems.

Kuo's report suggests that the upcoming iPhone 15 and next year's iPhone 16 lineup will continue using Qualcomm's 5G modems, with the iPhone 17 possibly being the first iPhone to use Apple's self-developed 5G modem.

However, Kuo suggested that due to supply-chain issues and problems regarding mass-production of the connectivity modem, the launch of Apple’s 5G modem might get delayed to 2025. It remains unclear what kind of improvements and benefits Apple's in-house modems will bring to the iPhones over Qualcomm's 5G chips.

Wall Street indexes provided a weak lead-in to regional shares as stronger-than-expected U.S. service sector data pushed up concerns over sticky inflation. This fueled a sell-off in technology stocks, as did weakness in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), after China ordered government employees to stop using foreign devices, including Apple’s iPhones.

Asian tech slammed by Apple weakness, renewed U.S.-China fears

Shares of Asian Apple suppliers, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK: ), Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) and Japan Display Inc (TYO: ) all retreated, given that the Chinese move came just days before the launch of the new iPhone 15 range.

But in addition to the Apple news, Asian technology stocks were also hit by suggestions from top Republican lawmakers that the U.S. should end all technology exports to China’s Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (HK: ), after the two unveiled new chips that allegedly violated recent trade restrictions.

Technology-heavy bourses were the worst performers for the day, with Hong Kong’s down 0.9%, while South Korea’s shed 0.6%.

SMIC was the worst performer on the Hang Seng, down over 6% after U.S. lawmakers alleged that the firm’s new chips, which were featured in Huawei phones, were produced using restricted U.S. technology.

The rhetoric could spur more U.S. restrictions on tech exports to China, and could potentially invite retaliatory measures from Beijing, heralding further destabilization in global trade.

Chinese stocks sink amid growth risks, trade data offers little cheer

China’s and indexes fell 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, with the prospect of renewed Sino-U.S. tensions also coming as China struggles with a slowing economic recovery.

While data showed that China’s and shrank at a slower-than-expected pace in August, they still remained close to historic lows, as businesses grappled with sluggish local and overseas demand.

China’s also shrank more than expected to a two-month low, as relatively steady imports offset dwindling exports.

Concerns over China spilled over into other markets, with Australia’s down over 1%. The country’s also shrank more than expected in July, hitting a 17-month low as commodity exports to China dried up.

On the other hand, losses in Japanese stocks were limited, especially as recent comments from Bank of Japan officials suggested that the bank will maintain its easy monetary policy for the time being. The shed 0.2%, while the broader was flat.

“One of its goals is to develop features such as one that allows iPhone customers to use simple voice commands to automate tasks involving multiple steps, according to people familiar with the effort,” the report said late on Wednesday.

The technology might allow users to tell the Siri voice assistant on their phone to create a GIF using the last five photos they’ve taken and text it to a friend, the report added.

Currently, an iPhone user has to manually programme the individual actions.

John Giannandrea, Apple’s head of AI, had authorised the formation of a team to develop conversational AI, known as large-language models four years back.

This was long before ChatGPT came into existence.

A chatbot is in the works would “interact with customers who use AppleCare” while another may make it easier to automate multistep tasks with Siri.

Apple’s most advanced LLM, known internally as Ajax GPT, has been trained on “more than 200 billion parameters” and is more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, according to the report, citing sources.

The tech giant was yet to comment on the report.

Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed last month that the tech giant has been working on generative AI and other models for years.

Cook said that Apple views AI and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.

“And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,” Cook told CNBC.

“On a research basis, we’ve been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,” Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and it was largely missing from its latest quarterly report too.

The tech giant is also slated to launch other devices, such as the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and AirPods Pro 2.

The upcoming iPhone 15 series will mark a significant departure from previous models with the inclusion of a USB-C port, replacing the signature lightning port. This change is expected to offer faster data transmission and charging speeds across all models in the lineup.

In terms of design, the Pro models are likely to switch from stainless steel to a grade 5 titanium finish for a more durable and lighter casing with a smooth non-reflective look. The standard models may also see the introduction of the Dynamic Island feature, a pill-like notch introduced in last year's Pro models.

The camera system in both standard and Pro models will be another highlight of the event. Major camera upgrades are expected across all four models, with specific enhancements for different tiers.

Apple relies heavily on Greater China region for both manufacturing and sales of its iPhones and has a major chunk of its product manufacturing in the country amid its future plans to make India the next big manufacturing hub.

“Restrictions on foreign devices are the latest step in Beijing’s campaign to reduce reliance on overseas technology and could hurt Apple’s success in the country,” the report noted.

China apparently ordered officials at central government agencies not to use Apple’s iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office.

The move is a blow to Apple’s public perception in China which is its second-biggest market after the US.

Apple didn’t immediately comment on the development.

The rumored MacBook series is expected to be launched as early as the second half of 2024.

The upcoming MacBook models are anticipated to come with the usual metal casing, but may incorporate less expensive materials and components in order to reduce costs. This strategy would set them apart from the existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.

As of today, Apple's cheapest laptop is the M1-powered MacBook Air 13-inch, available at a starting price of Rs. 99,900 in India. This device features a 13.3-inch IPS Retina display with a resolution of 1,600x2,560 pixels and is powered by the Apple M1 chip. It also offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of onboard storage, an HD FaceTime camera, a Touch ID sensor, and stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Atmos.

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, is deliberating on investing in Arm Holdings' initial public offering (IPO), according to Chairman Mark Liu on Wednesday. The decision is expected to be made this week. Arm Holdings, owned by SoftBank (TYO: ) Group, initiated the roadshow for its IPO on Tuesday, aiming to persuade investors of its worth of as much as $52 billion in this year's most substantial share sale.

Several of Arm's major clients, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (KS: ), have already committed as cornerstone investors in its IPO. Liu emphasized the importance of Arm to TSMC's ecosystem, technology, and customers. ""Arm is an important element of our ecosystem, our technology and our customers' ecosystem. We want it to be successful, we want it to be healthy. That's the bottom line,"" Liu said.

In addition to the potential investment in Arm's IPO, Liu also addressed the progress of TSMC's plant in Arizona. The company is investing $40 billion into this significant project. Despite initial delays due to a shortage of specialist workers pushing production start from next year to 2025, Liu expressed no concern over the plant's success. He noted that the improvement over the last five months has been ""tremendous"". ""I just came from Arizona last month. Any project of that new fertile ground will have some learning curve. In the past five months the improvement has been tremendous. I’m sure it will be a very successful project,"" he said.

2022-09-06, IANS,Microsoft to end mandatory use of Edge for Windows 11 users in EU,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-to-end-mandatory-use-of-edge-for-windows-11-users-in-eu-3798287,"San Francisco, Sep 6 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is discontinuing its requirement for Windows 11 users in the European Economic Area (EEA) to use Microsoft Edge for accessing widgets and searching results.The tech giant has begun testing changes to Windows 11 in recent test builds, which will be limited to countries within Europe.

""In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links,"" reads a change note from a Windows 11 test build released to Dev Channel testers.

According to The Verge, Microsoft has been neglecting default browser choices in Windows 10 search and the taskbar widget that forces users into Edge instead of their default browser when clicking links.

This trend was continued in Windows 11, with search still forcing users into Edge and a new dedicated widgets area that also ignored the default browser setting.

Now, both search and Windows Widgets will soon use the default browser for opening links in EU countries as they are system-level components in Windows 11.

Previously, third-party apps like EdgeDeflector could be used to open Start menu search results in the default browser.

The tech giant shut this workaround down nearly two years ago, the report said.

Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are reportedly pushing to keep Bing and iMessage off the list of designated “gatekeepers” as part of the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Once the EU designates its gatekeepers, they will have six months, or until March 2024, to comply with the DMA’s rules.

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are ""privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren't large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act"".

Microsoft is ""unlikely"" to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

2022-09-06, Investing.com,Apple and Arm extend partnership with long-term chip technology deal,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-arm-extend-partnership-with-longterm-chip-technology-deal-93CH-3797986,"Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Arm, the Softbank-owned company that developed the ARM architecture, have signed a long-term agreement for sharing chip technologies, extending their partnership beyond 2040. The news was confirmed through public documents filed on Tuesday this week.

This development follows Apple's decision to invest in Arm stock after the company announced its plans to go public on the stock market. The agreement was not mentioned in the IPO filing documents made public on August 21, indicating that this new deal was signed between then and Monday.

While neither company has disclosed the specifics of the agreement, it is likely that Apple aims to ensure continued access to the ARM architecture. The ARM-based chips are integral to Apple's product line, powering devices from the Apple Watch to the iPhone and iPad. In 2020, Apple announced a significant transition for its Mac lineup, which now also features the same Apple Silicon chips instead of Intel (NASDAQ: ) processors.

The partnership between Apple and Arm dates back decades before the advent of the iPhone. As early as 1993, Apple had incorporated ARM chips in its Newton handheld computer. The ARM technology has enabled Apple to create devices with high performance and remarkable energy efficiency.

In addition to Apple, other customers of Arm, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Samsung (KS: ), agreed last week to invest $735 million in the company's initial public offering.

The company has priced its IPO in a range that would value it at up to $52 billion, according to a filing on Tuesday. This valuation is below a $64 billion calculation following a recent stake sale involving its current owner SoftBank (TSE:TYO: ).

SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of total shares outstanding in the offering. The IPO will test market appetite for an important technology company in an environment of high interest rates. Despite the lower-than-expected valuation, Arm remains optimistic, as it aims to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares priced between $47 and $51 each.

Arm's technology powers chips inside nearly every smartphone globally. It hopes that several of its partners, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), will invest in its IPO as strategic investors. Such investments could potentially push up the valuation.

However, Arm's exposure to the sluggish smartphone market and the Chinese market have raised questions among analysts about its growth trajectory. Albie Amankona, an analyst at Third Bridge, expressed skepticism about the long-term sustainability of revenue growth and high margins of ARM in a research note on Monday. He predicts a yearly revenue growth of 5-10% for the next five years, followed by a peak and subsequent contraction on a yearly basis.

In its most recent fiscal year, Arm generated $2.68 billion of revenue and net income of $524 million. The company's targeted valuation suggests a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 92 to 100 times, less than Nvidia's 117 times but significantly higher than other chip makers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), which trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 15 times.

The city was chosen as the starting point due to the presence of T. Rowe Price's headquarters there, highlighting the fund manager's importance as a potential investor.

The company announced earlier on Tuesday that it aims to raise approximately $4.9 billion from its IPO, which would value the firm at over $52 billion. If achieved, this would make it the largest stock market flotation of 2022.

In addition to T. Rowe Price, Arm also held meetings with other potential investors on Tuesday, including Arlington, Virginia-based Sands Capital. The company plans to meet with more investors in various cities, such as New York, leading up to the pricing of its IPO scheduled for September 13.

Many of Arm's major clients have already committed to investing in the IPO. These include tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (KS: ). Furthermore, Arm disclosed that cornerstone investors have separately indicated an interest in purchasing a combined total of $735 million worth of the American Depositary Shares (ADS) being sold through the IPO.

While Arm declined to comment on these developments, T. Rowe Price and Sands Capital have yet to respond to requests for comments. The roadshow is expected to underscore the significance of these fund managers and other potential investors in ensuring a successful flotation for Arm Holdings.

The bank emphasized that factors such as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and massive spending on research and development (R&D) will help solidify the sector's leadership position.

The tech sector has been leading the stock market since Apple (NASDAQ: ) became the world's largest company about a decade ago. Despite the ever-changing landscape of the top companies and sectors represented in the , Goldman Sachs predicts that the tech sector's lead is not likely to end in the near future.

Goldman Sachs provided three reasons why dominant tech companies may maintain their size in the current cycle longer than in previous technology cycles. Firstly, the bank noted that technology is deflationary, lowering prices for consumers and giving lawmakers no incentive to attack the sector from a pricing standpoint.

Secondly, technology is now considered a national security issue. Cybersecurity, chips, and increasingly AI are seen as critical parts of national infrastructure and strategic defense, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions worldwide.

Lastly, technology companies' ability to invest in themselves is a significant factor. Goldman Sachs pointed out that incumbent winners in the tech sector are so cash-generative that they can sustain this investment, strengthening their market 'moat' and potential future growth. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, over 60% of intangible digital investment comes from the top 10% of firms by market value.

The ratio of growth capital expenditure (capex), including R&D, as a share of operating cash flow is higher in technology than in any other sector. Tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are spending more than $100 billion in capex, a large portion of which is allocated to cloud computing and AI. Generative AI is likely the fastest-growing category within this investment.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,Arm scales down New York listing amid investor valuation concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/arm-scales-down-new-york-listing-amid-investor-valuation-concerns-93CH-3797650,"British microchip designer Arm is scaling back its much-anticipated New York listing, as investors value the company significantly below its Japanese owner SoftBank (TYO: )'s previous expectations. The company announced on Tuesday that SoftBank plans to sell between $4.4bn and $4.9bn worth of shares when it goes public on the NASDAQ next week, substantially less than the initially projected $8bn to $10bn. Despite this reduction, the flotation is still set to be the largest of the year.

The decision comes in the wake of concerns raised over Arm's growth and its reliance on its challenging Chinese division since filing to go public two weeks ago. In an updated filing on Tuesday, Arm estimated its shares would be priced between $47 and $51, implying a company valuation of between $48bn and $52bn. This figure falls short of the $64bn valuation at which SoftBank valued Arm in a recent deal with its separate Vision Fund, and also below the $70bn bankers had anticipated.

This listing is being keenly observed as investors hope it could rejuvenate a dormant IPO market and restore faith in the tech sector, which has experienced falling valuations over the past year. As part of the flotation, several tech giants including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) will purchase up to $735m worth of shares. Other participants include Taiwanese chip titans Mediatek and TSMC, chip manufacturers Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD, and semiconductor design firms Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) and Cadence. Notably absent from this group are Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and US chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), who were previously rumored to be potential investors.

The downsized offering represents a setback for Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's CEO and Arm's chairman. Son was banking on a successful listing to offset a series of underwhelming tech investments. Despite this, SoftBank will remain Arm's dominant shareholder immediately after the flotation with about 90.6% of shares, and will be barred from selling further shares until 180 days post-listing.

The decision to list in New York rather than London was made despite efforts from Rishi Sunak to persuade the company to return to the London Stock Exchange. This is partly because tech companies are perceived as securing higher valuations in the US.

Despite Arm's semiconductor designs being used in 99% of the world's smartphones and impacting 70% of the global population through its technology, investors have expressed doubts about its growth potential. With China accounting for 24% of Arm's sales last year and operating independently, the company has admitted this exposes it to ""significant risks."" Ahead of setting a final price and going public next week, Arm is embarking on an investor roadshow over the coming days.

“Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,” they wrote in a report to clients.

Companies that integrate generative AI into their business practices can benefit from faster product and content introductions, leading to higher revenues and 20-30% lower costs, according to the analysts.

“In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, tech-enhanced competitors will put companies out of business that aren't equally tech-first, in our view. Using generative AI to drive higher ROICs in media and internet will become table stakes within 3-5 years, we estimate. Use it or lose it (via bankruptcy) is our key investment conclusion,” they added.

While the analysts say it’s hard to pick winners and losers now, they believe that clear winners could prove to be “the arms dealers that house large language models (LLMs).”

“Today, the 3 LLM front-runners are , and . We believe these 3 companies will grow their market caps to be larger than AAPL's $3T.”

The analysts argue that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is “not a core beneficiary of the trend toward generative AI because it is not an arms dealer.”

“We assume AAPL can protect its best-in-class ecosystem from defections, but we believe Android/GOOGL will grow to be a larger company driven by its Cloud business, generative AI capabilities, and best in class 1st-party global consumer data,” they concluded."

Shares in the tech behemoth fell 3.6% yesterday on the WSJ report that China is expanding its ban on iPhones to state-owned firms and government agencies.

Apple stock is down a further 2.7% in premarket Thursday.

China Government Ban

The situation in China has developed as the government ordered officials at central government agencies not to use iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office. These instructions were reportedly communicated to staff by their superiors in workplace chat groups or meetings, the WSJ report noted.

The potential expansion of the iPhone ban in China could have significant implications for foreign brands operating in the country, including Apple.

China is crucial for Apple, and the company relies on this market for approximately 19% of its overall revenue.

“China accounts for roughly 40-50mn iPhone units for Apple. We estimate up to a 5mn to 10mn-unit headwind if such a ban were to go through and subsequently be enforced. Additionally, if iPhones are banned from being carried into official workplaces (the Journal article suggests this as well), the impact could be higher given the high propensity of Chinese consumers to own and carry multiple phones,” BofA analysts wrote in a client note.

“We estimate that every 1mn iPhones translates to about a penny in EPS. The prior foreign branded laptop ban announced in 2022 allowed for a 2-year time frame to comply. It remains unclear what the timing of this potential ban would be.”

Increased competition

Moreover, Apple’s China rival Huawei introduced a new smartphone capable of ultrafast data connectivity. This, in addition to the government ban, could weigh on Apple’s iPhone sales in China.

“The government ban and the new Huawei phone will be material events for the iPhone,” said analysts at Oppenheimer. “The two combined will drive more Android users to upgrade to the Huawei, or iPhone users going back to Huawei.”

According to the analysts, Apple could lose 10 million iPhone shipments in 2024 because of the new Huawei phone. Coupled with lost shipments due to the government ban in China, Apple could be looking at 15-20 million in lost iPhone shipments for the next year.

The launch of the Mate 60 Pro, priced at $960 for presale, comes just a few days before Apple is scheduled to release its iPhone 15 lineup.

BofA analysts added that the timing of the potential ban is “interesting” as it coincides with the launch of Huawei's new high-end smartphone."
2022-09-07, Investing.com,"U.S. stock futures mixed, Chinese exports fall - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stock-futures-mixed-chinese-exports-fall--whats-moving-markets-3800412,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed open for equities on Wall Street, as investors examine how recent services sector data and a closely-watched Federal Reserve survey could impact the central bank's monetary policy. Elsewhere, China's exports contract in August in a sign of mounting pressure on the manufacturing industry in the world's second biggest economy, while a report that Beijing is barring government officials from using iPhones at work weighed on Apple (NASDAQ: ) shares.

1. Futures mixed following Wednesday slide

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Thursday after stronger-than-anticipated U.S. services sector data sent Treasury yields higher and weighed on equities in the prior session.

At 05:40 ET (09:40 GMT), the contract added 41 points or 0.1%, the contract lost 9 points or 0.2%, and dipped by 87 points or 0.6%.

Monthly data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Wednesday showed that -- which makes up more than two-thirds of the American economy -- unexpectedly accelerated in August, hitting a six-month high. paid by these businesses also rose.

The numbers suggested that consumer demand is shrugging off a recent spike in interest rates -- a resilience that analysts at ING posited could be linked to a summer of popular concerts and movies. After the release of the figures, yields in both two- and ten-year U.S. government bonds climbed, while all three of the major indices on Wall Street declined.

2. Fed survey points to modest economic growth

The services data fueled some bets that the Federal Reserve may choose to hike interest rates later this year to stamp out the stubborn final embers of last year's surge in price gains.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , the probability that America's central bank will choose to raise rates at its November meeting now stands at 43.6%, up from 39.3% in the prior day.

Investors, however, are still largely pricing in the chance that the Fed will keep borrowing costs steady at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% for the remainder of 2022. The predictions were largely supported by a on Wednesday that pointed to modest growth and cooling inflation in the world's biggest economy in July and August.

The so-called ""Beige Book"" summary bolstered expectations that, even accounting for the expanding services industry, Fed policymakers were either done or wrapping up their long-standing tightening campaign.

More clues about the path ahead for rates may come on Thursday from a fintech conference where a number of Fed officials are due to speak.

3. Crude slips on weak Chinese trade data

Oil prices fell Thursday, climbing down from 10-month peaks as more signs of slowing Chinese growth overshadowed another draw in U.S. inventories that hinted at tightening supplies.

Weak trade figures out of China were seen as a signal that the world's largest crude importer is at risk of missing Beijing's annual growth target of about 5% (see below).

Meanwhile, data released late Wednesday by the industry body American Petroleum Institute showed inventories fell for a fourth straight week, dropping 5.5 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 1. The reading usually acts as a precursor to inventory data from the Energy Information Administration, which is due later in the day.

By 05:40 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% lower at $86.83 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.8% to $89.92.

4. Chinese exports slump

China's dropped by 8.8% annually in August, while contracted by 7.3%, in a fresh sign of the significant pressure on the country's crucial manufacturing sector.

Although the trade numbers on Thursday topped estimates, they still indicate that government policymakers may need to do more to help shore up China's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.

Along with flagging exports, China's economy has been hit by a liquidity crisis in its property sector. Officials in Beijing have rolled out a series of smaller measures aimed at buttressing growth, but have yet to launch a wide-scale stimulus program.

Yet the woes were not confined to Asia. Industrial production in Germany fell by more than anticipated in July, exacerbating concerns that the eurozone's largest economy and major regional growth driver may be about to slip back into recession.

5. China bars government officials from using iPhones at work - WSJ

Shares in Apple decreased by just under 3.6% on Wednesday after the Wall Street Journal reported that China has banned government officials from using the tech giant's popular iPhone and other foreign-branded devices for work.

Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, the paper said the order, which also prohibits government workers from bringing these smartphones into the office, had been handed down in recent weeks. It was not immediately clear how widely the directives were being distributed, the WSJ noted.

Traders seemingly took the report as a potential indication that China may be willing to reduce its reliance on American companies in its bid to boost domestic players. This could prove to be a blow to Apple's business in China, which generates almost a fifth of the firm's total revenue."
2022-09-07, Investing.com,Huawei's new Mate 60 series challenges Qualcomm's market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/huaweis-new-mate-60-series-challenges-qualcomms-market-dominance-93CH-3800378,"On Thursday, Huawei unveiled its new Mate 60 series of smartphones, featuring the company's own 5G Kirin 9000s chipset manufactured by SMIC on a 7nm process node. The move marks a significant shift for Huawei, which has previously been a major customer of Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that this development could pose a serious threat to Qualcomm's dominance in the market. In 2022, Huawei purchased between 23 million and 25 million mobile phone System-on-Chips (SoCs) from Qualcomm, and this figure increased to 40-42 million in 2022. Kuo projects that Qualcomm's SoC shipments to Chinese smartphone brands could reduce by at least 50–60 million units in 2024 due to Huawei’s adoption of the new Kirin processors.

In response to this competition, Qualcomm may initiate a price war as early as Q4 2022 to maintain its market share in China, potentially impacting its profits. Kuo also highlighted two other potential risks for Qualcomm: an increase in the market share of the Exynos 2400 in Samsung (KS: ) mobile phones and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s expected shift to its own modem chip in 2025.

The Kirin 9000S chip is not expected to match up with the most powerful Snapdragon SoC in performance or efficiency. However, it signifies Huawei's resilience despite the US trade ban restricting the company from receiving any American 5G technology.

Qualcomm's next flagship chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, is expected to cost $180 per unit. If the company loses approximately 60 million Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 shipments, as projected by Kuo, this could translate into a loss of roughly $10.8 billion.

While Huawei has not yet announced plans to release Kirin SoCs to other Chinese phone makers, should it decide to do so, it is likely that these chips would be cheaper than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. As such, Qualcomm also needs to consider competition from Samsung's Exynos 2400 set to debut with the Galaxy S24 lineup.

The first iPhone model to feature Apple's self-developed modem could be the iPhone SE 4th generation, according to renowned Apple Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

The company has been working on its own network modem for over five years, having acquired Intel’s Modem division in 2019. Despite this acquisition, Apple continues to rely on Qualcomm for 5G-enabled modems.

Kuo's report suggests that the upcoming iPhone 15 and next year's iPhone 16 lineup will continue using Qualcomm's 5G modems, with the iPhone 17 possibly being the first iPhone to use Apple's self-developed 5G modem.

However, Kuo suggested that due to supply-chain issues and problems regarding mass-production of the connectivity modem, the launch of Apple’s 5G modem might get delayed to 2025. It remains unclear what kind of improvements and benefits Apple's in-house modems will bring to the iPhones over Qualcomm's 5G chips.

2022-09-07, Investing.com,"Asian stocks fall amid economic gloom, tech hit by U.S.-China woes",https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-amid-economic-gloom-tech-hit-by-uschina-woes-3799816,"Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday as trade data pointed to continued weakness in the Chinese economy, while regional technology shares were hit by the prospect of more U.S. curbs on China after officials balked at a supposed Chinese chip breakthrough.

Wall Street indexes provided a weak lead-in to regional shares as stronger-than-expected U.S. service sector data pushed up concerns over sticky inflation. This fueled a sell-off in technology stocks, as did weakness in Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ), after China ordered government employees to stop using foreign devices, including Apple’s iPhones.

Asian tech slammed by Apple weakness, renewed U.S.-China fears

Shares of Asian Apple suppliers, including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ), AAC Technologies Holdings Inc (HK: ), Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW: ) and Japan Display Inc (TYO: ) all retreated, given that the Chinese move came just days before the launch of the new iPhone 15 range.

But in addition to the Apple news, Asian technology stocks were also hit by suggestions from top Republican lawmakers that the U.S. should end all technology exports to China’s Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) (HK: ), after the two unveiled new chips that allegedly violated recent trade restrictions.

Technology-heavy bourses were the worst performers for the day, with Hong Kong’s down 0.9%, while South Korea’s shed 0.6%.

SMIC was the worst performer on the Hang Seng, down over 6% after U.S. lawmakers alleged that the firm’s new chips, which were featured in Huawei phones, were produced using restricted U.S. technology.

The rhetoric could spur more U.S. restrictions on tech exports to China, and could potentially invite retaliatory measures from Beijing, heralding further destabilization in global trade.

Chinese stocks sink amid growth risks, trade data offers little cheer

China’s and indexes fell 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively, with the prospect of renewed Sino-U.S. tensions also coming as China struggles with a slowing economic recovery.

While data showed that China’s and shrank at a slower-than-expected pace in August, they still remained close to historic lows, as businesses grappled with sluggish local and overseas demand.

China’s also shrank more than expected to a two-month low, as relatively steady imports offset dwindling exports.

Concerns over China spilled over into other markets, with Australia’s down over 1%. The country’s also shrank more than expected in July, hitting a 17-month low as commodity exports to China dried up.

On the other hand, losses in Japanese stocks were limited, especially as recent comments from Bank of Japan officials suggested that the bank will maintain its easy monetary policy for the time being. The shed 0.2%, while the broader was flat.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a muted open, with heavyweight technology stocks expected to track their U.S. peers."

“One of its goals is to develop features such as one that allows iPhone customers to use simple voice commands to automate tasks involving multiple steps, according to people familiar with the effort,” the report said late on Wednesday.

The technology might allow users to tell the Siri voice assistant on their phone to create a GIF using the last five photos they’ve taken and text it to a friend, the report added.

Currently, an iPhone user has to manually programme the individual actions.

John Giannandrea, Apple’s head of AI, had authorised the formation of a team to develop conversational AI, known as large-language models four years back.

This was long before ChatGPT came into existence.

A chatbot is in the works would “interact with customers who use AppleCare” while another may make it easier to automate multistep tasks with Siri.

Apple’s most advanced LLM, known internally as Ajax GPT, has been trained on “more than 200 billion parameters” and is more powerful than OpenAI’s GPT-3.5, according to the report, citing sources.

The tech giant was yet to comment on the report.

Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed last month that the tech giant has been working on generative AI and other models for years.

Cook said that Apple views AI and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.

“And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,” Cook told CNBC.

“On a research basis, we’ve been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,” Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and it was largely missing from its latest quarterly report too.

The tech giant is also slated to launch other devices, such as the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and AirPods Pro 2.

The upcoming iPhone 15 series will mark a significant departure from previous models with the inclusion of a USB-C port, replacing the signature lightning port. This change is expected to offer faster data transmission and charging speeds across all models in the lineup.

In terms of design, the Pro models are likely to switch from stainless steel to a grade 5 titanium finish for a more durable and lighter casing with a smooth non-reflective look. The standard models may also see the introduction of the Dynamic Island feature, a pill-like notch introduced in last year's Pro models.

The camera system in both standard and Pro models will be another highlight of the event. Major camera upgrades are expected across all four models, with specific enhancements for different tiers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are reported to feature a stacked camera sensor from Sony (NYSE: ) that will enhance performance in low-light conditions. The Pro Max model is slated to feature a new periscope lens that allows for enhanced zoom capabilities, potentially rivaling Samsung (KS: )'s Galaxy S23 Ultra.

Under the hood, the Pro models will be powered by the new A17 Bionic chipset, while the standard models will feature the A16 Bionic chipset, similar to last year's iPhone 14 Pro models.

The pricing for the new series is expected to increase for the Pro models, with an anticipated $100 price hike for the iPhone 15 Pro and a $200 increase for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. However, prices for the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are not expected to change.

In addition to the iPhones, Apple's event will also showcase other products. While minor battery and performance upgrades are expected for the Apple Watch Series 9, a new pink color option could be introduced. The Watch Ultra 2 is expected to be lighter with a larger battery and display size, possibly available in a dark titanium color option. Lastly, consistent with changes in the iPhone lineup, the next generation Apple AirPods Pro 2 is also expected to come with a USB-C port.

Apple relies heavily on Greater China region for both manufacturing and sales of its iPhones and has a major chunk of its product manufacturing in the country amid its future plans to make India the next big manufacturing hub.

“Restrictions on foreign devices are the latest step in Beijing’s campaign to reduce reliance on overseas technology and could hurt Apple’s success in the country,” the report noted.

China apparently ordered officials at central government agencies not to use Apple’s iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office.

The move is a blow to Apple’s public perception in China which is its second-biggest market after the US.

Apple didn’t immediately comment on the development.

According to the company’s latest quarterly results, the Greater China region -- Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan -- contributed to nearly 19 per cent of the revenue in the June quarter.

According to the the IDC, 65.7 million smartphones shipped in China in the second quarter (Q2) this year, a narrower decline of 2.1 per cent compared to the same period last year.

In the first half of the year, the Chinese market saw 130.9 million shipments, down 7.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY).

Huawei and Apple were the only vendors with a positive YoY growth in the Top 5 ranking, as the price discounts of Apple’s iPhone 14 series successfully stimulated the demand in the country.

The rumored MacBook series is expected to be launched as early as the second half of 2024.

The upcoming MacBook models are anticipated to come with the usual metal casing, but may incorporate less expensive materials and components in order to reduce costs. This strategy would set them apart from the existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.

As of today, Apple's cheapest laptop is the M1-powered MacBook Air 13-inch, available at a starting price of Rs. 99,900 in India. This device features a 13.3-inch IPS Retina display with a resolution of 1,600x2,560 pixels and is powered by the Apple M1 chip. It also offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of onboard storage, an HD FaceTime camera, a Touch ID sensor, and stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Atmos.

The move by Apple comes amid growing competition in the affordable PC market, particularly from Google's Chromebooks and multiple entry-level Windows laptops. These devices have gained popularity among students and within the education sector. According to the DigiTimes report, more than 13.9 million Chromebooks were shipped in 2019, over 30.4 million units in 2020, and more than 33.5 million Chromebooks in 2021. Apple is expected to target this robust market with its upcoming MacBook laptops priced under $1,000 (roughly Rs. 80,000).

However, Apple has not officially announced any plans for the development or release of affordable MacBook models yet.

Earlier this year in June, during its annual developer conference WWDC 2022, Apple launched its MacBook Air 15 with a starting price of Rs. 1,34,900. The company also unveiled its first mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, alongside other new Mac models and upcoming software updates during the same event.

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

Google responded to the announcement in a blog post, saying it will continue to work closely with EU Commission and ""other stakeholders"" as it ""review[s] our designation decision and assess[es] its implications."""

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

""In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links,"" reads a change note from a Windows 11 test build released to Dev Channel testers.

According to The Verge, Microsoft has been neglecting default browser choices in Windows 10 search and the taskbar widget that forces users into Edge instead of their default browser when clicking links.

This trend was continued in Windows 11, with search still forcing users into Edge and a new dedicated widgets area that also ignored the default browser setting.

Now, both search and Windows Widgets will soon use the default browser for opening links in EU countries as they are system-level components in Windows 11.

Previously, third-party apps like EdgeDeflector could be used to open Start menu search results in the default browser.

The tech giant shut this workaround down nearly two years ago, the report said.

Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are reportedly pushing to keep Bing and iMessage off the list of designated “gatekeepers” as part of the EU's new Digital Markets Act (DMA).

Once the EU designates its gatekeepers, they will have six months, or until March 2024, to comply with the DMA’s rules.

The news was confirmed through public documents filed on Tuesday this week.

This development follows Apple's decision to invest in Arm stock after the company announced its plans to go public on the stock market. The agreement was not mentioned in the IPO filing documents made public on August 21, indicating that this new deal was signed between then and Monday.

While neither company has disclosed the specifics of the agreement, it is likely that Apple aims to ensure continued access to the ARM architecture. The ARM-based chips are integral to Apple's product line, powering devices from the Apple Watch to the iPhone and iPad. In 2020, Apple announced a significant transition for its Mac lineup, which now also features the same Apple Silicon chips instead of Intel (NASDAQ: ) processors.

The partnership between Apple and Arm dates back decades before the advent of the iPhone. As early as 1993, Apple had incorporated ARM chips in its Newton handheld computer. The ARM technology has enabled Apple to create devices with high performance and remarkable energy efficiency.

In addition to Apple, other customers of Arm, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Samsung (KS: ), agreed last week to invest $735 million in the company's initial public offering.

The company has priced its IPO in a range that would value it at up to $52 billion, according to a filing on Tuesday. This valuation is below a $64 billion calculation following a recent stake sale involving its current owner SoftBank (TSE:TYO: ).

SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of total shares outstanding in the offering. The IPO will test market appetite for an important technology company in an environment of high interest rates. Despite the lower-than-expected valuation, Arm remains optimistic, as it aims to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares priced between $47 and $51 each.

Arm's technology powers chips inside nearly every smartphone globally. It hopes that several of its partners, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), will invest in its IPO as strategic investors. Such investments could potentially push up the valuation.

However, Arm's exposure to the sluggish smartphone market and the Chinese market have raised questions among analysts about its growth trajectory. Albie Amankona, an analyst at Third Bridge, expressed skepticism about the long-term sustainability of revenue growth and high margins of ARM in a research note on Monday. He predicts a yearly revenue growth of 5-10% for the next five years, followed by a peak and subsequent contraction on a yearly basis.

In its most recent fiscal year, Arm generated $2.68 billion of revenue and net income of $524 million. The company's targeted valuation suggests a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 92 to 100 times, less than Nvidia's 117 times but significantly higher than other chip makers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), which trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 15 times.

These include tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (KS: ). Furthermore, Arm disclosed that cornerstone investors have separately indicated an interest in purchasing a combined total of $735 million worth of the American Depositary Shares (ADS) being sold through the IPO.

While Arm declined to comment on these developments, T. Rowe Price and Sands Capital have yet to respond to requests for comments. The roadshow is expected to underscore the significance of these fund managers and other potential investors in ensuring a successful flotation for Arm Holdings.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,"Tech sector set to continue market dominance, says Goldman Sachs",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-set-to-continue-market-dominance-says-goldman-sachs-93CH-3797773,"Technology companies are set to maintain their dominance in the stock market, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Monday. The bank emphasized that factors such as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and massive spending on research and development (R&D) will help solidify the sector's leadership position.

The tech sector has been leading the stock market since Apple (NASDAQ: ) became the world's largest company about a decade ago. Despite the ever-changing landscape of the top companies and sectors represented in the , Goldman Sachs predicts that the tech sector's lead is not likely to end in the near future.

Goldman Sachs provided three reasons why dominant tech companies may maintain their size in the current cycle longer than in previous technology cycles. Firstly, the bank noted that technology is deflationary, lowering prices for consumers and giving lawmakers no incentive to attack the sector from a pricing standpoint.

Secondly, technology is now considered a national security issue. Cybersecurity, chips, and increasingly AI are seen as critical parts of national infrastructure and strategic defense, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions worldwide.

Lastly, technology companies' ability to invest in themselves is a significant factor. Goldman Sachs pointed out that incumbent winners in the tech sector are so cash-generative that they can sustain this investment, strengthening their market 'moat' and potential future growth. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, over 60% of intangible digital investment comes from the top 10% of firms by market value.

The ratio of growth capital expenditure (capex), including R&D, as a share of operating cash flow is higher in technology than in any other sector. Tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are spending more than $100 billion in capex, a large portion of which is allocated to cloud computing and AI. Generative AI is likely the fastest-growing category within this investment.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,Arm scales down New York listing amid investor valuation concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/arm-scales-down-new-york-listing-amid-investor-valuation-concerns-93CH-3797650,"British microchip designer Arm is scaling back its much-anticipated New York listing, as investors value the company significantly below its Japanese owner SoftBank (TYO: )'s previous expectations. The company announced on Tuesday that SoftBank plans to sell between $4.4bn and $4.9bn worth of shares when it goes public on the NASDAQ next week, substantially less than the initially projected $8bn to $10bn. Despite this reduction, the flotation is still set to be the largest of the year.

The decision comes in the wake of concerns raised over Arm's growth and its reliance on its challenging Chinese division since filing to go public two weeks ago. In an updated filing on Tuesday, Arm estimated its shares would be priced between $47 and $51, implying a company valuation of between $48bn and $52bn. This figure falls short of the $64bn valuation at which SoftBank valued Arm in a recent deal with its separate Vision Fund, and also below the $70bn bankers had anticipated.

This listing is being keenly observed as investors hope it could rejuvenate a dormant IPO market and restore faith in the tech sector, which has experienced falling valuations over the past year. As part of the flotation, several tech giants including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) will purchase up to $735m worth of shares. Other participants include Taiwanese chip titans Mediatek and TSMC, chip manufacturers Intel (NASDAQ: ) and AMD, and semiconductor design firms Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) and Cadence. Notably absent from this group are Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and US chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), who were previously rumored to be potential investors.

The downsized offering represents a setback for Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's CEO and Arm's chairman. Son was banking on a successful listing to offset a series of underwhelming tech investments. Despite this, SoftBank will remain Arm's dominant shareholder immediately after the flotation with about 90.6% of shares, and will be barred from selling further shares until 180 days post-listing.

The decision to list in New York rather than London was made despite efforts from Rishi Sunak to persuade the company to return to the London Stock Exchange. This is partly because tech companies are perceived as securing higher valuations in the US.

Despite Arm's semiconductor designs being used in 99% of the world's smartphones and impacting 70% of the global population through its technology, investors have expressed doubts about its growth potential. With China accounting for 24% of Arm's sales last year and operating independently, the company has admitted this exposes it to ""significant risks."" Ahead of setting a final price and going public next week, Arm is embarking on an investor roadshow over the coming days.

The IPO, expected to hit the US stock market later this month, could value the company at as much as $52.3 billion.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, SoftBank revealed its aim to raise up to $4.9 billion from Arm's debut. This figure could increase to $5.2 billion if the banks underwriting the IPO exercise an option to purchase additional shares.

Several prominent players in the tech industry, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Google LLC (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Co., Ltd., and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) have shown interest in becoming cornerstone investors. Collectively, they could buy shares worth up to $735 million in the IPO.

Arm designs chips for 99% of the world's smartphones and licenses them to CPU makers such as Apple and Samsung. The company was publicly traded until 2016 when SoftBank acquired it for $32 billion.

In 2020, SoftBank attempted to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40 billion, which would have been the largest chip deal ever. However, global antitrust regulators did not approve of the transaction, leading to its cancellation in February 2022.

Despite this setback, if Arm's IPO values it at $52 billion, it would be a decrease from the approximately $64 billion valuation implied by SoftBank’s acquisition of the remaining 25% stake in Arm from its Vision Fund unit for around $16.1 billion last month.

This anticipated IPO has been closely watched as it promises to be the biggest US IPO since 2021 and potentially the world's largest in about a year since Porsche (ETR: ) raised about $8.7 billion in Frankfurt last September.

For the fiscal year ending March, Arm reported nearly $2.7 billion in revenue according to its prospectus. Following the listing, SoftBank is expected to retain approximately 90% ownership of Arm’s shares.

The report also stated that Meta will release a low-end Quest headset in 2024 for under $200.

The new high-end headset will be called the ""Meta Quest 4 Pro,"" breaking Meta's current practice of keeping the Quest and Quest Pro lineup numbers separate.

The current Meta Quest Pro costs $999, so it is possible that both companies will invest in more powerful hardware to compete with Apple Vision Pro, the report mentioned.

At the same time, Meta will soon release the more affordable Meta Quest 3 for $499.

Meanwhile, Meta has rolled out a new update 'v56' for the Quest headsets, which includes improvements to hand tracking, live captions at the system level, livestreaming to Facebook, and more.

""This is your friendly reminder that our software updates roll out gradually. If you don't see the v56 update yet, don't panic. It's on its way and should be in your virtual hands soon,"" the company said in a blogpost.

However, Samsung suffered a 12.4 per cent (quarter-on-quarter) downturn, while Apple marked a 21.2 per cent dip from the preceding quarter.

Moreover, the report said that global smartphone production has faced back-to-back quarterly declines.

""After plunging nearly 20 per cent in 1Q23, second-quarter numbers dwindled further by approximately 6.6 per cent, settling at a modest 272 million units. The first half of 2022 clocked in at a mere 522 million units -- marking a 13.3 per cent (year-on-year) decline and setting a ten-year low for both individual quarters and the first half of the year combined,"" the researchers said.

""Demand in consumer markets such as China, Europe, and North America has not shown a significant rebound as we move into the second half of the year. Even if economic indicators in the Indian market improve, it is still difficult to reverse the global decline in smartphone production,"" it added.

Further, the researchers predicted that the smartphone market may undergo another shift in Q2 this year due to poor global economic conditions, and production for the second half may consequently be further reduced.

Looking ahead to 2024, the current economic outlook is not optimistic, as per the report.

The researchers forecasted a 2 to 3 per cent annual increase in global production, depending on regional economic trends.

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are “privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren’t large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act”.

Microsoft is “unlikely” to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

However, it argues that Bing’s relatively small share in the global search market (compared to Google (NASDAQ: )) could only be further diminished with the new rules.

Apple is also reportedly working on ways that will open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloading to comply with new rules.

However, according to the report, the tech giant argues that iMessage shouldn’t have to “interoperate with other messaging services”.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,Arm's IPO valuation drops to $50bn-$55bn amid market skepticism,https://in.investing.com/news/arms-ipo-valuation-drops-to-50bn55bn-amid-market-skepticism-93CH-3796119,"The Cambridge-based chip designer, Arm, has seen its anticipated IPO valuation on fall from an initial estimate of $70bn a month ago to a range of $50bn-$55bn today, Monday. The drop in valuation reflects the market's increasing scrutiny of the firm's fundamentals such as growth rates, price-to-earnings ratios, and political risks associated with its Chinese operations.

A month ago, market observers estimated Arm's value at around $70bn, considering the company's pioneering status in the tech industry and the upcoming artificial intelligence revolution. Last month, Softbank (OTC: ), Arm's parent company, bought in the remaining 25% stake it did not already own at an implied valuation of $64bn.

However, recent reports suggest that U.S. investors are questioning these high valuations. Unlike other high-growth tech firms, Arm's revenue has been relatively stagnant, with last year's figure slightly down at $2.7bn. In addition, while the company's profit margins stand at a respectable 20%, they are not considered extraordinary within the tech sector. At a $50bn valuation, Arm would be valued at 75 times last year's operating profit.

Another concern for potential investors is Arm's minority stake in Arm China, which contributed to 24% of group revenue last year. The company entered into a joint venture in 2018 to maximize opportunities in the Chinese market. However, this arrangement also exposes the firm to economic and political risks in China, which could be exacerbated by tensions between the U.S. or the U.K. and China over trade and national security issues.

Despite these concerns, Arm remains a significant player in its field with its chip designs found in most of the world's smartphones. Major customers including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are reported to be interested in acquiring shares during the IPO. Furthermore, with 28 investment banks listed as underwriters for the IPO, Arm has substantial support to assist Softbank’s Masayoshi Son in selling only a 10% stake.

The British government and the London Stock Exchange had fought for a U.K. relisting of Arm. However, despite their efforts and Arm's status as a giant in its field, market skepticism over valuation appears warranted given the current facts and figures presented in the U.S. prospectus.

2022-09-03, IANS,Microsoft to shut Visual Studio for Mac next year,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-to-shut-visual-studio-for-mac-next-year-3794899,"San Francisco, Sep 3 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has announced the retirement of its Visual Studio for Mac and said that the support for the latest version, 17.6, will continue for another year, until August 31, 2024. ""Visual Studio for Mac 17.6 will continue to be supported for another 12 months, until August 31, 2024, with servicing updates for security issues and updated platforms from Apple (NASDAQ: ),"" Microsoft said in a blogpost.

With this announcement, the company said that ""we’re redirecting our resources and focus to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code, optimising them for cross-platform development. No new framework, runtime, or language support will be added to Visual Studio for Mac"".

For the next 12 months, however, Microsoft will continue providing essential updates such as servicing updates for critical bug fixes, security issues, and updated platforms from Apple.

In addition, it will continue to provide runtime and workload updates so users can continue building and shipping applications built on .NET 6, .NET 7, and the Mono frameworks.

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used by developers to write and debug code for Windows applications. The product has evolved over time to support more programming languages and platforms.

However, Microsoft claimed that the decision to discontinue Visual Studio for Mac should not be interpreted as a complete abandonment of the platform because there are alternatives in its portfolio.

Other options for continuing to use Visual Studio on macOS include running the IDE in a virtual machine or launching a cloud-based instance.

Last month, after iOS and Android, Microsoft announced to shut down its digital assistant Cortana app on Windows 11. While Cortana in Windows as a standalone app is deprecated, the support for Cortana in Teams mobile, Microsoft Teams display, and Microsoft Teams Rooms will end in the fall of 2022.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,Arm's IPO valuation drops to $50bn-$55bn amid market skepticism,https://in.investing.com/news/arms-ipo-valuation-drops-to-50bn55bn-amid-market-skepticism-93CH-3796119,"The Cambridge-based chip designer, Arm, has seen its anticipated IPO valuation on fall from an initial estimate of $70bn a month ago to a range of $50bn-$55bn today, Monday. The drop in valuation reflects the market's increasing scrutiny of the firm's fundamentals such as growth rates, price-to-earnings ratios, and political risks associated with its Chinese operations.

A month ago, market observers estimated Arm's value at around $70bn, considering the company's pioneering status in the tech industry and the upcoming artificial intelligence revolution. Last month, Softbank (OTC: ), Arm's parent company, bought in the remaining 25% stake it did not already own at an implied valuation of $64bn.

However, recent reports suggest that U.S. investors are questioning these high valuations. Unlike other high-growth tech firms, Arm's revenue has been relatively stagnant, with last year's figure slightly down at $2.7bn. In addition, while the company's profit margins stand at a respectable 20%, they are not considered extraordinary within the tech sector. At a $50bn valuation, Arm would be valued at 75 times last year's operating profit.

Another concern for potential investors is Arm's minority stake in Arm China, which contributed to 24% of group revenue last year. The company entered into a joint venture in 2018 to maximize opportunities in the Chinese market. However, this arrangement also exposes the firm to economic and political risks in China, which could be exacerbated by tensions between the U.S. or the U.K. and China over trade and national security issues.

Despite these concerns, Arm remains a significant player in its field with its chip designs found in most of the world's smartphones. Major customers including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are reported to be interested in acquiring shares during the IPO. Furthermore, with 28 investment banks listed as underwriters for the IPO, Arm has substantial support to assist Softbank’s Masayoshi Son in selling only a 10% stake.

The British government and the London Stock Exchange had fought for a U.K. relisting of Arm. However, despite their efforts and Arm's status as a giant in its field, market skepticism over valuation appears warranted given the current facts and figures presented in the U.S. prospectus.

2022-09-03, IANS,Microsoft to shut Visual Studio for Mac next year,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-to-shut-visual-studio-for-mac-next-year-3794899,"San Francisco, Sep 3 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) has announced the retirement of its Visual Studio for Mac and said that the support for the latest version, 17.6, will continue for another year, until August 31, 2024. ""Visual Studio for Mac 17.6 will continue to be supported for another 12 months, until August 31, 2024, with servicing updates for security issues and updated platforms from Apple (NASDAQ: ),"" Microsoft said in a blogpost.

With this announcement, the company said that ""we’re redirecting our resources and focus to enhance Visual Studio and VS Code, optimising them for cross-platform development. No new framework, runtime, or language support will be added to Visual Studio for Mac"".

For the next 12 months, however, Microsoft will continue providing essential updates such as servicing updates for critical bug fixes, security issues, and updated platforms from Apple.

In addition, it will continue to provide runtime and workload updates so users can continue building and shipping applications built on .NET 6, .NET 7, and the Mono frameworks.

Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) used by developers to write and debug code for Windows applications. The product has evolved over time to support more programming languages and platforms.

However, Microsoft claimed that the decision to discontinue Visual Studio for Mac should not be interpreted as a complete abandonment of the platform because there are alternatives in its portfolio.

Other options for continuing to use Visual Studio on macOS include running the IDE in a virtual machine or launching a cloud-based instance.

Last month, after iOS and Android, Microsoft announced to shut down its digital assistant Cortana app on Windows 11. While Cortana in Windows as a standalone app is deprecated, the support for Cortana in Teams mobile, Microsoft Teams display, and Microsoft Teams Rooms will end in the fall of 2022.

The tech giant would use 85 per cent of Globalstar’s network capacity to provide emergency satellite connectivity for iPhones outside of cellular networks.

The Globalstar launches are scheduled for 2025 and will send at least 17 new satellites to the low-Earth orbit.

Globalstar entered into a $327 million purchase agreement with MDA for those satellites in February last year.

Apple earlier invested $450 million in developing the critical infrastructure that supports Emergency SOS via satellite for iPhone 14 models.

Through the new service, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro models connect directly to a satellite, enabling them to message emergency services when they are outside of Wi-Fi and cellular coverage.

Apple's investment provides significant improvements to Globalstar's satellite network and ground stations, ensuring iPhone users are able to connect to emergency services when they are off the grid, according to a report.

""The launch of Emergency SOS via satellite direct to iPhone is a generational advancement in satellite communications, and we are proud that Globalstar's satellites and spectrum assets will play a central role in saving lives,"" according to Jay Monroe, Globalstar's Executive Chairman.

If an iPhone user makes an Emergency SOS via satellite request, the message is received by one of Globalstar's 24 satellites in low-earth orbit.

The message is then transmitted from the satellite to custom ground stations located at key points all over the world.

Customers will no longer be able to receive support from an Apple employee on these platforms once this change takes effect.

Beginning October 1, the @AppleSupport account on X will no longer respond to direct messages with human responses; instead, customers who message the account will receive an automated response outlining other ways to contact Apple for assistance, the report said.

In addition, customers will no longer be able to get technical help from Apple in the comments section of YouTube videos uploaded to the Apple Support channel, and the paid Community Specialist role for the Apple Support Community, an online discussion forum where customers can get help, will be eliminated.

According to the report, the tech giant is offering hundreds of affected employees the opportunity to transition to a phone-based support role within the company, but some advisors are unable or unwilling to do so.

The company is also not allowing employees to switch to another chat-based support role unless medically necessary, which has caused anger and frustration for some members of the social media team, the report added.

Further, the report mentioned that employees will be trained to provide phone support, and the transition is expected to be completed by November.

“The stacked CIS issue has been resolved by increasing production capacity, but it still affects about 10–15 per cent of shipments of regular models,” Kuo claimed.

Changing the supplier shipment ratio has resolved the panel issue while the battery and frame issues have been resolved mainly by improving production yield.

“The production challenges of titanium frames are high processing difficulty and significant design changes during development (canceling the virtual button design in 2Q23),” said Kuo, an analyst at TF International Securities, a financial services group in the Asia-Pacific region.

“The titanium frame should contribute to weight reduction,” he added.

The Pro Max project was the last to kick off, so mass production schedule lags behind other models, according to him.

On colours, he predicted that iPhone 15 Pro colours may be gray, white, black, and blue while the regular finishes may be black, pink, yellow, blue, and green.

On Monday, Kuo predicted that Apple could see a rebound in its stock price ahead of new product announcements in September and could become the world’s largest smartphone brand by 2022-2024.

Apple on Tuesday revealed that its next big global product launch -- showcasing the fresh lineup of iPhone 15 series -- will happen on September 12. The tech giant is also expected to announce new Apple Watches at the event.

The company said its “Wonderlust” event will take place live from Apple Park.

Some Apple iPhone 15 models are likely to support charging up to 35W that will offer faster charging speeds.

Currently, the iPhone 14 Pro is limited to charging at 27W while the regular iPhone 14 offers 20W charging.

For the Pro models, Apple is expected to introduce a new Action Button that will replace the Mute/Ring Switch, the A17 Bionic chip, a new titanium frame, and better cameras with a periscope lens for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, according to reports.

The rose 0.9%, 292 points, was up 1.7%, and the rose 1.5% higher.

Treasury yields wobble after consumer confidence, job openings come up short

Treasury yields continued to ease as the latest economic data showing an unexpected fall in consumer confidence and a surprise drop in job openings pushed up bets that the Fed is likely to stand pat on rates in September.

The Conference Board’s fell to 106.1 in August from 114 in July, confounding economists’ forecast for a reading of 116.

The U.S. Labor Department's latest (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in July fell to about 8.8 million, missing expectations of 9.46M.

Following the weaker-than-expected data, suggesting that the Fed’s rate hikes are beginning to work, bets on a Fed pause in September jumped to nearly 90% from about 80% last week, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

Tech takes flight as yields wobble to fuel growth stocks

Big tech was in rally mode as falling Treasury yields, which make higher-valued growth stocks including tech and consumer stocks more attractive, pushed the broader market higher.

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) led the move higher, with the latter getting its three-day cloud event underway and unveiling plans to integrate artificial intelligence deeper into its cloud products.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 2% after announcing that it would launch the iPhone 15 at an event on Sept. 12.

Broader sentiment on tech continues to be healthy as a Bank of America (NYSE: ) survey showed Tuesday that tech was among the top sectors that drove in a $3.7 billion of inflows to stocks last week.

Farfetch cuts losses despite downgrade; Nio falls on wider loss

Farfetch (NYSE: ) cut its losses even as Morgan Stanley downgraded the luxury and beauty products platform to equal weight from overweight, citing a high level of volatility and limited near-term catalysts.

The downgrade comes just a week after the luxury and beauty products platform weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue and cut its guidance.

Nio Inc (NYSE: ), meanwhile a wider-than-expected loss, sending its shares 1% lower. The Chinese EV maker did, however, say it expects to deliver between 55,000 and 57,000 vehicles in the current quarter, above estimates of 50,000.

Crypto-related stocks jump on Bitcoin spot ETF optimism

Crypto-related stocks including Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: ), Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ) were pushed higher by a surge in bitcoin after a U.S. court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to dismiss digital asset manager Grayscale's application for a spot bitcoin exchange.

The U.S. Labor Department's latest (JOLTs) report, a measure of labor demand, showed job openings in July fell to about 8.8 million, missing expectations of 9.46M.

Following the weaker-than-expected data, suggesting that the Fed’s rate hikes are beginning to work, bets on a Fed pause in September jumped to nearly 90% from about 80% last week, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

Tech takes flight as yields wobble to fuel growth stocks

Big tech was in rally mode as falling Treasury yields, which make higher-valued growth stocks including tech and consumer stocks more attractive, pushed the broader market higher.

Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) led the move higher, with the latter getting its three-day cloud event underway and unveiling plans to integrate artificial intelligence deeper into its cloud products.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose more than 2% after announcing that it would launch the iPhone 15 at an event on Sept. 12.

Broader sentiment on tech continues to be healthy as a Bank of America (NYSE: ) survey showed Tuesday that tech was among the top sectors that drove in a $3.7 billion of inflows to stocks last week.

Farfetch cuts losses despite downgrade; Nio falls on wider loss

Farfetch (NYSE: ) cut its losses even as Morgan Stanley downgraded the luxury and beauty products platform to equal weight from overweight, citing a high level of volatility and limited near-term catalysts.

Crypto-related stocks jump on Bitcoin spot ETF optimism

Crypto-related stocks including Marathon Digital Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: ), Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ) were pushed higher by a surge in bitcoin after a U.S. court ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to dismiss digital asset manager Grayscale's application for a spot bitcoin exchange.

California-based Nvidia, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has become a focal point in a surge in excitement over the nascent technology.

Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market value to above $1 trillion, on par with tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, a euphoria that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap companies, which include Nvidia, have helped spur on a more than 14% jump in the benchmark this year.

Analysts have said that Nvidia's numbers and the outlook for the rest of the year could thus influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to have posted revenue of $11.04 billion in its second quarter. Nearly three-fourths of the top-line figure is expected to consist of revenue from Nvidia's crucial data center business, which houses its all-important H100 chip used in AI-fueled platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

In a recent note to clients, analysts at Piper Sandler said they believe the conversation around Nvidia will ""boil down to the data center"" unit.

Meanwhile, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin raises the prospect of a ""reacceleration scenario"" in the American economy as central bankers from around the world prepare to congregate for a key economic symposium this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

1. Eagerly awaited Nvidia results on deck

Earnings season may be gradually winding down, but investors still have major results to examine, including the latest quarterly figures from chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

The California-based company, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has been at the center of global euphoria around the development of the nascent technology.

Shares in Nvidia have tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market capitalization to above $1 trillion - a valuation approaching tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, an excitement that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally earlier this summer.

For these reasons, analysts claim that Nvidia's returns and its outlook for the rest of the year could influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

2. Fed's Barkin warns of 'reacceleration' as Jackson Hole looms

The Federal Reserve must be ready to address a reacceleration in the U.S. economy despite an unprecedented series of aggressive hikes aimed at corralling and slowing growth, according to Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

Speaking with Reuters on Tuesday, Barkin pointed to recent data showing hotter-than-expected and increasing consumer confidence as hints that the economy could remain strong even as prices stay elevated.

Such a scenario, Barkin flagged, may indicate a wider ""playing field"" of outcomes beyond a recession or a so-called ""soft landing,"" which would see the Fed cool inflation without sparking an economic meltdown. It may also support the case for more monetary policy tightening, Barkin suggested.

The comments come ahead of a highly anticipated economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver remarks on Friday, with traders keen to receive any update on the central bank's outlook for inflation. Last week, minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that most policymakers believe more rate rises may be required to address lingering ""upside risks"" to inflation -- a statement that has helped fuel a recent surge in bond yields.

3. Urban Outfitters reports earnings beat; more retail results ahead

Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: ) posted better-than-expected profit per share in its second quarter, sending shares higher in premarket trading, as the apparel group was boosted by record net sales and lower transportation costs.

of $1.10 in the three months until the end of July topped estimates of $0.89, due in part to a decrease in inbound transportation expenses. Net sales also surged to a record $1.27 billion, thanks to surging demand at the Philadelphia-based group's Free People brand that helped offset weakness at its eponymous Urban Outfitters label.

Meanwhile, La-Z-Boy (NYSE: ) also unveiled fiscal first quarter income that , but the recliner and sofa manufacturer warned of ""soft"" consumer trends, hinting at the challenges faced by many retailers as inflation-hit consumers pull back on spending on nonessential items. Shares fell premarket.

On Wednesday, other retail firms Kohl's (NYSE: ), Peloton (NASDAQ: ), Foot Locker (NYSE: ) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ) are scheduled to deliver their quarterly returns before the bell.

4. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Wednesday as traders geared up for the release of Nvidia's earnings and looked ahead to the Federal Reserve's symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming later in the week.

At 05:25 ET (09:25 GMT), the contract added 124 points or 0.36%, rose by 22 points or 0.51%, and jumped by 100 points or 0.67%.

The main indices had a mixed session on Tuesday, with both the 30-stock and benchmark slipping by 0.3% and 0.5%, respectively and the tech-heavy ticking up by 0.06%.

5. Crude slides amid U.S. crude stock data, Jackson Hole anticipation

Oil prices inched lower Wednesday despite another fall in U.S. crude stocks, although trading ranges remain tight ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium.

The latest iOS 17 beta 7 adds new haptic feedback patterns for when the user enables or disables Silent Mode.

For new phones with an Action Button, these new patterns should make the phone vibrate more noticeably when the user moves between modes.

When the iPhone entered Silent Mode in previous versions of iOS, there was only a brief haptic feedback, but never when Silent Mode was turned off.

""While the new haptic feedback for when Silent Mode is turned on is available for all iPhone models, the feedback for switching back to normal mode is unused,"" the report said.

Last month, the tech giant had released the fourth beta of iOS 17 to developers, and some new code snippets in it revealed the functions of the Action button.

According to the code found in iOS 17 beta 4, the new Action button is expected to have nine different options that users will be able to customise: Accessibility, Shortcuts, Silent, Camera, Flashlight, Focus, Magnifier, Translate and Voice Memos.

Earlier, it was rumoured that the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro smartphone models would be equipped with the latest Wi-Fi 6E technology, enabling high-speed wireless connectivity.

It was also reported that the tech giant is expected to limit its display features -- Always-On and ProMotion -- to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max.

Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2022.

Last month, Bernstein analysts assessed Arm’s fair-market value to be about $40 billion, reports TechCrunch.

SoftBank recently acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Arm, reportedly at a valuation of more than $64 billion.

Arm has developed and licensed high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology.

The company has customers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Mercedes-Benz.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

Arm is a core supplier of architecture technology to most semiconductor companies.

Its Arm instruction set is at the core of nearly all mobile processors powering smartphones, including those made by Apple and Android devices that use Qualcomm chips.

The European Commission also opened an in-depth investigation to assess the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia.

Arm is reportedly developing its own chip, aiming to showcase the capabilities of its designs and attract new customers.

Arm said on late-Monday that it had publicly filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, although the firm did not specify how many shares will be issued and at what valuation.

The move comes after several delays in SoftBank’s plans to list the firm, following the implosion of the $40 billion Arm sale to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), over antitrust concerns.

SoftBank (OTC: ) had repeatedly delayed the listing, and had only recently provided a timeline on the matter, as the Japanese tech giant seeks to capitalize on a boom in artificial intelligence development in the coming years.

Arm is expected to benefit from this boom, given that its designs are used in chips by several major tech giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia. The firm receives royalties from every chip sold by its customers.

SoftBank’s shares rose as much as 3%, also helping spur a 0.7% gain in the . Arm’s listing heralds a shot in the arm for the tech giant, which has been otherwise struggling with a sharp drop in the valuations of its tech holdings over the past year.

SoftBank clocked six straight quarters of losses as rising interest rates battered the value of its tech holdings. Arm had remained among the few bright spots in SoftBank’s portfolio, although the chip designer also swung to a loss in the second quarter.

Arm’s listing comes at a time when several major chipmakers have warned of a cyclical downturn for the industry, with chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) recently warning that a boom in AI demand may be insufficient to offset a broader decline.

Still, the firm’s listing is expected to provide SoftBank with more capital. Recent Reuters reports said that SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of Arm’s shares in the planned IPO, and that it is seeking a valuation of between $60 billion and $70B for the unit.

SoftBank also recently bought back a 25% stake in Arm from its Saudi-backed Vision Fund."

The iPhone maker also announced that Linkfire, the marketing platform used by the world’s top artists and labels, is expanding into podcasting this fall with a powerful toolkit built for podcasters, featuring an exclusive integration with Apple Podcasts.

With a Linkfire account, creators will be able to generate an unlimited number of smart links to landing pages for their podcasts and measure the ways listeners engage with them.

Apple and Samsung’s corporate battle started 13 years ago. Since then, the two tech giants have been competing for the title of the world’s largest smartphone vendor, with each holding roughly a 25 per cent market share.

Still, the difference between their total shipments in the past decade is huge, according to data presented by CasinosEnLigne.com.

According to Statista and IDC data, between 2013 and 2022, Apple shipped 2.07 billion iPhones worldwide, with 2015 and 2021 as the record years for sales.

In the first half of 2022, the US tech giant shipped another 97.7 million of its smartphones, pushing the 10-year iPhone sales to 2.16 billion.

Data shows that Samsung shipped 3.08 billion smartphones between Q1 2013 and Q2 2022, or 42 per cent more than Apple.

However, the IDC data showed an interesting trend in the annual shipment figures. Although Samsung leads in total shipments, its annual smartphone shipments have dropped by 18 per cent in the past 10 years. In 2022, the company shipped 258.2 million smartphones, down from 316.4 million reported in 2013.

On the other hand, Apple’s shipments surged by 46 per cent in this period, jumping from 153.4 million to 225.3 million.

“Although Apple lost the race with Samsung in total shipments over the past decade, the StatCounter data show the US tech giant overtook its leading position and became the largest player in the global smartphone market,” the report mentioned.

As of July, Apple’s iPhone had a 28.3 per cent share in the global mobile vendor market, up from 27.5 per cent in the same month a year ago.

On the other hand, Samsung’s market share stood at 24.22 per cent last month, down from 28.17 per cent in July 2022.

Researchers from the US-based Florida Atlantic University (FAU) tested plastic, rubber, cloth, leather and metal ( and silver) wristbands in search of a correlation between the material of the wristband and bacteria build-up.

They discovered that 95 per cent of the wristbands were contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria.

Specifically, 85 per cent had Staphylococcus spp, which causes staph infections, 60 per cent had E. coli bacteria, and 30 per cent had potentially lethal Pseudomonas spp.

The gym-goer had the highest bacteria counts for staph infections, which can cause sepsis or even death, emphasising the importance of sanitising wristbands after working out, according to the study.

While activity levels were associated with bacterial growth, the texture of the wristband material was the biggest predictor.

Plastic and rubber wristbands were found to have higher bacteria counts, while metal ones -- particularly gold and silver -- had little or no bacteria, the study showed.

According to the researchers, plastic and rubber wristbands provide an ideal environment for germs to congregate because their porous and static surfaces attract and allow bacterial growth.

When the watches were worn by different genders, there was no discernible difference.

""The quantity and taxonomy of bacteria we found on the wristbands show that there is a need for regular sanitation of these surfaces,"" said senior author Nwadiuto Esiobu, PhD.

""Even at relatively low numbers, these pathogens are of public health significance,"" he added.

He also pointed out that active, gym-going healthcare workers should be especially cautious when it comes to sanitizing their watches to avoid potentially infecting at-risk patients.

Researchers at Shackler School of Medicine and Leviev Heart Center in Israel conducted tests on the man and diagnosed a major heart problem: familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy with greatly reduced left ventricular systolic function.

After treatment began, which included additional cardio exercise routines, the symptoms started to get better.

Familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy occurs by the thinning and weakening of the heart muscle walls in at least one chamber, leading to an enlargement of that area.

As a result, the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently is compromised compared to its normal functioning.

""The researchers indicate that having a device like the Apple Watch can detect these categories, especially as it relates to early screenings that can potentially identify serious issues before they become a larger issue,"" the report said.

Last month, an Apple Watch had helped to save a trail runner's life after falling during a run, by calling an ambulance.

In June, a man had credited Apple Watch's fall detection feature for saving his life by calling emergency services and his wife, after he fell from a ladder and hit his head.

In February this year, an Apple Watch had helped to save the wearer's life, by alerting about a racing pulse following a nap that led to a diagnosis of severe internal bleeding.

In the letter, the biggest players in technology and manufacturing said the move ""could significantly disrupt trade, hamper efforts to more closely integrate India into global supply chains, and harm businesses and consumers in both countries"".

Eight American trade groups asked the government to urge India to reconsider the policy, reports Bloomberg News.

The industry groups included the Information Technology Industry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Semiconductor Industry Association.

They wrote in the letter that any barrier to trade could affect the shipment of US-made computers and electronics into India.

According to the notification by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in India, for clearance of import consignments with effect from November 1, 2022, a valid licence for restricted imports is required.

The government has told tech companies that the restrictions are not to ban imports but to promote exports via domestic manufacturing.

Meanwhile, top consumer electronics companies like HP, Apple and Dell last week urged the government to extend the November 1 deadline for the licences required for PCs, laptops and tablets by at least an year, as it will take time to configure and set up manufacturing/assembling units as per new guidelines.

In a meeting with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) officials, also attended by leading industry bodies the Manufacturing Association of IT Hardware (MAIT) and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the tech companies conveyed to the government they need more time to set up manufacturing units in the country, according to sources.

California-based Nvidia, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has become a focal point in a surge in excitement over the nascent technology.

Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market value to above $1 trillion, on par with tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, a euphoria that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap companies, which include Nvidia, have helped spur on a more than 14% jump in the benchmark this year.

Analysts have said that Nvidia's numbers and the outlook for the rest of the year could thus influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to have posted revenue of $11.04 billion in its second quarter. Nearly three-fourths of the top-line figure is expected to consist of revenue from Nvidia's crucial data center business, which houses its all-important H100 chip used in AI-fueled platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

1. Eagerly awaited Nvidia results on deck

Earnings season may be gradually winding down, but investors still have major results to examine, including the latest quarterly figures from chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

The California-based company, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has been at the center of global euphoria around the development of the nascent technology.

Shares in Nvidia have tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market capitalization to above $1 trillion - a valuation approaching tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, an excitement that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally earlier this summer.

For these reasons, analysts claim that Nvidia's returns and its outlook for the rest of the year could influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

2. Fed's Barkin warns of 'reacceleration' as Jackson Hole looms

The Federal Reserve must be ready to address a reacceleration in the U.S. economy despite an unprecedented series of aggressive hikes aimed at corralling and slowing growth, according to Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

Speaking with Reuters on Tuesday, Barkin pointed to recent data showing hotter-than-expected and increasing consumer confidence as hints that the economy could remain strong even as prices stay elevated.

Such a scenario, Barkin flagged, may indicate a wider ""playing field"" of outcomes beyond a recession or a so-called ""soft landing,"" which would see the Fed cool inflation without sparking an economic meltdown. It may also support the case for more monetary policy tightening, Barkin suggested.

The comments come ahead of a highly anticipated economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver remarks on Friday, with traders keen to receive any update on the central bank's outlook for inflation. Last week, minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that most policymakers believe more rate rises may be required to address lingering ""upside risks"" to inflation -- a statement that has helped fuel a recent surge in bond yields.

2022-08-22, IANS,Softbank-owned chip design company Arm set for year’s biggest IPO,https://in.investing.com/news/softbankowned-chip-design-company-arm-set-for-years-biggest-ipo-3779858,"New York, Aug 22 (IANS) British chip design company Arm, owned by Japanese investment giant SoftBank, has filed for an IPO listing with , which is touted as the year’s biggest. Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2022.

Last month, Bernstein analysts assessed Arm’s fair-market value to be about $40 billion, reports TechCrunch.

SoftBank recently acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Arm, reportedly at a valuation of more than $64 billion.

Arm has developed and licensed high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology.

The company has customers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), and Mercedes-Benz.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

Arm is a core supplier of architecture technology to most semiconductor companies.

Its Arm instruction set is at the core of nearly all mobile processors powering smartphones, including those made by Apple and Android devices that use Qualcomm chips.

The European Commission also opened an in-depth investigation to assess the acquisition of Arm by Nvidia.

Arm is reportedly developing its own chip, aiming to showcase the capabilities of its designs and attract new customers.

2022-08-22, Investing.com,SoftBank rises as chip unit Arm files for Nasdaq IPO,https://in.investing.com/news/softbank-rises-as-chip-unit-arm-files-for-nasdaq-ipo-3779847,"Investing.com -- Shares of Japanese technology conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (TYO: ) rose on Tuesday after its unit, chip designer Arm, filed for a long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) on the .

Arm said on late-Monday that it had publicly filed a registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, although the firm did not specify how many shares will be issued and at what valuation.

The move comes after several delays in SoftBank’s plans to list the firm, following the implosion of the $40 billion Arm sale to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), over antitrust concerns.

SoftBank (OTC: ) had repeatedly delayed the listing, and had only recently provided a timeline on the matter, as the Japanese tech giant seeks to capitalize on a boom in artificial intelligence development in the coming years.

Arm is expected to benefit from this boom, given that its designs are used in chips by several major tech giants including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia. The firm receives royalties from every chip sold by its customers.

SoftBank’s shares rose as much as 3%, also helping spur a 0.7% gain in the . Arm’s listing heralds a shot in the arm for the tech giant, which has been otherwise struggling with a sharp drop in the valuations of its tech holdings over the past year.

SoftBank clocked six straight quarters of losses as rising interest rates battered the value of its tech holdings. Arm had remained among the few bright spots in SoftBank’s portfolio, although the chip designer also swung to a loss in the second quarter.

Arm’s listing comes at a time when several major chipmakers have warned of a cyclical downturn for the industry, with chipmaking giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ) recently warning that a boom in AI demand may be insufficient to offset a broader decline.

Still, the firm’s listing is expected to provide SoftBank with more capital. Recent Reuters reports said that SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of Arm’s shares in the planned IPO, and that it is seeking a valuation of between $60 billion and $70B for the unit.

SoftBank also recently bought back a 25% stake in Arm from its Saudi-backed Vision Fund."

Also, these modules can be filtered to see the real-time analytics for various time periods, such as the past 30 days or the previous month.

Subscription analytics are available worldwide for all creators with at least one active subscription and an Admin, Finance, or Legal role in Apple Podcasts Connect.

The iPhone maker also announced that Linkfire, the marketing platform used by the world’s top artists and labels, is expanding into podcasting this fall with a powerful toolkit built for podcasters, featuring an exclusive integration with Apple Podcasts.

With a Linkfire account, creators will be able to generate an unlimited number of smart links to landing pages for their podcasts and measure the ways listeners engage with them.

""Creators can also link to their shows on other apps and feature related products, such as social channels, newsletters, merch stores, and live events,"" the tech giant said.

In January, Apple Podcasts launched Delegated Delivery, making it possible for creators to publish subscriber episodes directly from their participating hosting provider dashboard.

Now, the company introduced new hosting providers that will support Delegated Delivery by the end of this year: Audiomeans, Captivate, Podbean, Podspace and Transistor.

Apple and Samsung’s corporate battle started 13 years ago. Since then, the two tech giants have been competing for the title of the world’s largest smartphone vendor, with each holding roughly a 25 per cent market share.

Still, the difference between their total shipments in the past decade is huge, according to data presented by CasinosEnLigne.com.

According to Statista and IDC data, between 2013 and 2022, Apple shipped 2.07 billion iPhones worldwide, with 2015 and 2021 as the record years for sales.

In the first half of 2022, the US tech giant shipped another 97.7 million of its smartphones, pushing the 10-year iPhone sales to 2.16 billion.

Data shows that Samsung shipped 3.08 billion smartphones between Q1 2013 and Q2 2022, or 42 per cent more than Apple.

However, the IDC data showed an interesting trend in the annual shipment figures. Although Samsung leads in total shipments, its annual smartphone shipments have dropped by 18 per cent in the past 10 years. In 2022, the company shipped 258.2 million smartphones, down from 316.4 million reported in 2013.

On the other hand, Apple’s shipments surged by 46 per cent in this period, jumping from 153.4 million to 225.3 million.

“Although Apple lost the race with Samsung in total shipments over the past decade, the StatCounter data show the US tech giant overtook its leading position and became the largest player in the global smartphone market,” the report mentioned.

As of July, Apple’s iPhone had a 28.3 per cent share in the global mobile vendor market, up from 27.5 per cent in the same month a year ago.

On the other hand, Samsung’s market share stood at 24.22 per cent last month, down from 28.17 per cent in July 2022.

Xiaomi, Vivo and OPPO followed with 11.21 per cent, 6.06 per cent and 5.53 per cent market shares in July.

Researchers from the US-based Florida Atlantic University (FAU) tested plastic, rubber, cloth, leather and metal ( and silver) wristbands in search of a correlation between the material of the wristband and bacteria build-up.

They discovered that 95 per cent of the wristbands were contaminated with potentially harmful bacteria.

Specifically, 85 per cent had Staphylococcus spp, which causes staph infections, 60 per cent had E. coli bacteria, and 30 per cent had potentially lethal Pseudomonas spp.

The gym-goer had the highest bacteria counts for staph infections, which can cause sepsis or even death, emphasising the importance of sanitising wristbands after working out, according to the study.

While activity levels were associated with bacterial growth, the texture of the wristband material was the biggest predictor.

Plastic and rubber wristbands were found to have higher bacteria counts, while metal ones -- particularly gold and silver -- had little or no bacteria, the study showed.

According to the researchers, plastic and rubber wristbands provide an ideal environment for germs to congregate because their porous and static surfaces attract and allow bacterial growth.

When the watches were worn by different genders, there was no discernible difference.

""The quantity and taxonomy of bacteria we found on the wristbands show that there is a need for regular sanitation of these surfaces,"" said senior author Nwadiuto Esiobu, PhD.

""Even at relatively low numbers, these pathogens are of public health significance,"" he added.

He also pointed out that active, gym-going healthcare workers should be especially cautious when it comes to sanitizing their watches to avoid potentially infecting at-risk patients.

Researchers at Shackler School of Medicine and Leviev Heart Center in Israel conducted tests on the man and diagnosed a major heart problem: familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy with greatly reduced left ventricular systolic function.

After treatment began, which included additional cardio exercise routines, the symptoms started to get better.

Familial nonischemic cardiomyopathy occurs by the thinning and weakening of the heart muscle walls in at least one chamber, leading to an enlargement of that area.

As a result, the heart's ability to pump blood efficiently is compromised compared to its normal functioning.

""The researchers indicate that having a device like the Apple Watch can detect these categories, especially as it relates to early screenings that can potentially identify serious issues before they become a larger issue,"" the report said.

Last month, an Apple Watch had helped to save a trail runner's life after falling during a run, by calling an ambulance.

In June, a man had credited Apple Watch's fall detection feature for saving his life by calling emergency services and his wife, after he fell from a ladder and hit his head.

In February this year, an Apple Watch had helped to save the wearer's life, by alerting about a racing pulse following a nap that led to a diagnosis of severe internal bleeding.

Also, in January, an Apple Watch had been credited for detecting undiagnosed heart blockage in a woman.

Meanwhile, in October last year, Apple Watch had helped to detect rare cancer in a 12-years old girl.

In the letter, the biggest players in technology and manufacturing said the move ""could significantly disrupt trade, hamper efforts to more closely integrate India into global supply chains, and harm businesses and consumers in both countries"".

Eight American trade groups asked the government to urge India to reconsider the policy, reports Bloomberg News.

The industry groups included the Information Technology Industry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Semiconductor Industry Association.

They wrote in the letter that any barrier to trade could affect the shipment of US-made computers and electronics into India.

According to the notification by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in India, for clearance of import consignments with effect from November 1, 2022, a valid licence for restricted imports is required.

The government has told tech companies that the restrictions are not to ban imports but to promote exports via domestic manufacturing.

Meanwhile, top consumer electronics companies like HP, Apple and Dell last week urged the government to extend the November 1 deadline for the licences required for PCs, laptops and tablets by at least an year, as it will take time to configure and set up manufacturing/assembling units as per new guidelines.

In a meeting with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) officials, also attended by leading industry bodies the Manufacturing Association of IT Hardware (MAIT) and the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), the tech companies conveyed to the government they need more time to set up manufacturing units in the country, according to sources.

Post November 1, no entity will be allowed to import laptops, computers, and related items without a license.

The Centre has said the restrictions were imposed for security reasons and also for promoting the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat’ mission.

Regional macro risks are extending smartphone replacement rates to record levels. North America continues to be a major drag on global recovery, with a disappointing first half of 2022 setting it up for double-digit full-year declines.

Despite strength in the jobs market and inflation falling, consumers are hesitant to upgrade their devices, pushing replacement rates for the US and globally to record highs, the report noted.

However, premium and ultra-premium growth is a trend that is happening globally and favours vendors like Apple (NASDAQ: ) which have portfolios heavily weighted in the higher segments, said the report.

The year could mark the start of a new era for Apple as a resilient premium market and strong showing in the US could help it become number one globally in terms of annual shipments for the first time ever.

“It’s the closest Apple’s been to the top spot. We’re talking about a spread that’s literally a few days’ worth of sales. Assuming Apple doesn’t run into production problems like it did last year, it’s really a toss-up at this point,” said Jeff Fieldhack, research director for North America.

The analysts are watching Q4 with interest because the “iPhone 15 launch is a window for carriers to steal high-value customers”.

“And with that big iPhone 12 installed base up for grabs promos are going to be aggressive, leaving Apple in a good spot,” Fieldhack noted.

Even though she locked the bike, she left the key there, and someone was able to steal the bike.

""When she left (the gym) an hour or so later, the bike was gone,"" Spaltemberg's husband William Lacerda was quoted as saying.

Spaltemberg opened the Find My app right away and was able to check the bike's location almost in real-time.

The pair then made a call to the police to report the incident.

Lacerda claimed to have located the bike, and two officers went with them to that location.

When they arrived, the stolen bike was exactly where the Find My app indicated.

Since the thief had locked the bike to a lamppost, the couple used the Precision Finding feature to show the police that it was Spaltemberg's bike.

""It all happened in about an hour and a half. The police officer told me that we were very lucky to have an AirTag (on the bike) because bike thefts are common here, and usually, they only make a police report for such situations,” said Lacerda.

He also noted the AirTag was “very well hidden,” because of which the thief didn’t suspect anything.

AirTag's use proved invaluable in reuniting many users with their lost or stolen items.

Last month, an AirTag had helped a cyclist to track his bicycle after an airline lost it.

It was also reported that an AirTag had helped to track stolen possessions, resulting in the burglar's arrest and 15-month imprisonment term.

In June, the tracker had helped to bust robbers who stole more than $62,000 in thefts.

Notably, the premium tablet segment exhibited a remarkable 48 per cent (quarter-on-quarter) growth. However, the overall tablet market witnessed a 22 per cent (year-on-year) decline in Q2 2022.

""Tablets have found utility in electronic health records (EHR) management, telemedicine, patient monitoring, and more, enhancing efficiency and patient care. The ongoing shift to 5G holds immense promise, revolutionising work, learning, and leisure experiences,"" said Menka Kumari, Analyst-Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CyberMedia Research (CMR).

2022-08-18, IANS,Apple iPhone 15 may support faster charging up to 35W,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-iphone-15-may-support-faster-charging-up-to-35w-3776493,"New Delhi, Aug 18 (IANS) Some Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15 models are likely to support charging up to 35W that will offer faster charging speeds.Currently, the iPhone 14 Pro is limited to charging at 27W while the regular iPhone 14 offers 20W charging.

To fully recharge an iPhone 14 Pro Max at these speeds, it takes approximately two hours.

According to 9to5Mac, some of the new iPhone 15 models, to be launched next month, will support faster charging.

Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also made similar predictions recently, claiming that the company would ditch Lightning in favour of USB-C in 2022, which would enable faster charging speeds for iPhone 15 Pro models.

However, the feature may only be supported via Apple-certified cables, he predicted.

Last year, Apple introduced a new 35W Dual USB-C charger that is capable of recharging all current iPhone models at full speed.

Apple also sells a 30W USB-C charger, which is designed for the MacBook Air but also works with iPhone and iPad.

It is still not clear if 35W charging will be available on all iPhone 15 models.

iPhone 15 models will feature a new design with slightly curved edges, while the camera bump will be larger and the display bezels thinner.

For the Pro models, Apple is expected to introduce a new Action Button that will replace the Mute/Ring Switch, the A17 Bionic chip, a new titanium frame, and better cameras with a periscope lens for the iPhone 15 Pro Max, according to reports.

The trends were in line to slightly below store expectations, according to KeyBanc analysts, who added that macro headwinds persisted.

""Key First Look Data [KFLD] also indicates weaker sales of iPhones (-2% m/m, -8% y/y), which were below historical seasonal trends. This likely reflects continued inflationary pressure on consumer spending and emerging signs of a seasonal iPhone 15 pause,"" the analysts wrote.

""KFLD for July shows indexed spending +6% m/m, below the three-year average of +18%, which we are comparing against June's earlier than typical launch of Mac products,"" they added.

Therefore, the firm's data suggests below-typical revenue growth for AAPL, the analysts said.

""With U.S. upgrade rates trending at all-time lows, we believe there will likely be weakness domestically, which will need to be offset again by outperformance internationally,"" they said.

Regional macro risks are extending smartphone replacement rates to record levels. North America continues to be a major drag on global recovery, with a disappointing first half of 2022 setting it up for double-digit full-year declines.

Despite strength in the jobs market and inflation falling, consumers are hesitant to upgrade their devices, pushing replacement rates for the US and globally to record highs, the report noted.

However, premium and ultra-premium growth is a trend that is happening globally and favours vendors like Apple (NASDAQ: ) which have portfolios heavily weighted in the higher segments, said the report.

The year could mark the start of a new era for Apple as a resilient premium market and strong showing in the US could help it become number one globally in terms of annual shipments for the first time ever.

“It’s the closest Apple’s been to the top spot. We’re talking about a spread that’s literally a few days’ worth of sales. Assuming Apple doesn’t run into production problems like it did last year, it’s really a toss-up at this point,” said Jeff Fieldhack, research director for North America.

The analysts are watching Q4 with interest because the “iPhone 15 launch is a window for carriers to steal high-value customers”.

“And with that big iPhone 12 installed base up for grabs promos are going to be aggressive, leaving Apple in a good spot,” Fieldhack noted.

In China, “Apple is well positioned as the premium segment continues to gain more share,” added Ethan Qi, associate director for China.

Driver Hannah Ralph's iPhone contacted both emergency responders and her emergency contacts, including friend Grace Workman-Porecki, reports AppleInsider.

""The response time was incredible,"" said Workman-Porecki.

Workman-Porecki also thanked the Grey Highlands’ first responders and staff at Markdale Hospital for helping Ralph.

She underwent successful surgery to repair several breaks in her legs while in the hospital.

""I'm telling everyone who drives in rural areas to get this [Crash Detection] technology,"" said Ralph's aunt Dr Angela Jones of Burlington.

""Who knows how long it could take to get help [without it?]"" she added.

Ralph's family and friends have also created a GoFundMe campaign to support her recovery from the accident and return to work.

Last month, a combination of Crash Detection and Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite on an iPhone 14 had helped to save a man who drove off a cliff in California and was bleeding from the head, by guiding rescuers to the driver.

The man's car went over a cliff and dropped 400 feet before crashing to a halt.

According to sources, a small set to ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units are likely to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

Other Apple suppliers in India like Pegatron and Wistron (being acquired by the Tata Group) will also assemble iPhone 15 as soon as possible, they added.

Bloomberg was first to report about the development.

Last year, Apple started assembling iPhone 14 at the Foxconn facility in India in September, a first in years when a new iPhone was assembled within weeks of its global launch in the country.

This time, the deadline has further been shifted to nearly a month early, so that the locally-assembled iPhone 15 can go on sale in the country at par with global right before the festive season, as well as can be exported fast.

Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company has set a June quarter records in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones.

During the company’s fiscal 2022 third quarter results, Cook said that the performance of “our new stores in India this spring exceeded our expectations”.

On a specific question on the potential of India, Cook said: “You know we did hit a June quarter revenue record in India and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first two retail stores during the quarter and of course it’s early going currently, but they are currently beating our expectations in terms of how they are doing”.

He further said that the company continues to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in its direct-to-consumer offers in the country.

“We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,” he added.

Apple, with the highest average selling price (ASP) of $929, registered a massive 61 per cent YoY growth in India in the April-June period, according to the IDC.

India is now among Apple’s top 5 markets globally as the iPhone maker continued to lead the ultra-premium segment (Rs 45,000 and above).

According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Two iPhone owners who objected to the settlement have lost their appeal in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals over its terms, removing the final obstacle to the deal, reports The Mercury News.

The iPhone maker in 2020 agreed to pay up to $500 million to resolve the lawsuit.

According to the 2018 lawsuit, consumers complained their phones were shutting off even though the batteries showed a charge of more than 30 per cent.

The devices at issue were iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, and SE devices running operating systems iOS 10.2.1 or later before December 21, 2017, and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus phones running iOS 11.2 or later before that date.

Apple was yet to comment on the development.

The law firm Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy representing Apple customers, said that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal challenging the historic agreement with Apple to settle a nationwide class-action.

After years of litigation, the team at CPM, along with co-lead counsel, Kaplan Fox, successfully negotiated the settlement -- the largest all-cash recovery in a computer intrusion case in history -- on behalf of a class of approximately 100 million iPhone users.

“The settlement is the result of years of investigation and hotly contested litigation. We are extremely proud that this deal has been approved, and following the Ninth Circuit’s order, we can finally provide immediate cash payments to impacted Apple customers,” said Mark C. Molumphy, a partner at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy.

Stern, who most recently served as vice president of services at Apple, overseeing Apple TV+, iCloud and Apple News+, will be president of “Ford Integrated Services” effective immediately. The new Ford business will focus primarily on integrating hardware, software and services across Ford Blue, Model e and Ford Pro.

Ford is increasing its emphasis on connected vehicles, as the auto industry moves towards subscription-based revenue from complex cars and trucks. Ford has more than 550,000 paid software and services subscribers, with Ford Pro commercial customers accounting for more than 80% of them, the company said.

Chriss, currently a senior executive at software firm Intuit (NASDAQ: ), will take over at PayPal on September 27. He will replace outgoing boss Dan Schulman, who will remain on the board of the company until its annual stockholder meeting next May.

PayPal said Chriss had the ""unanimous support"" of its board, calling him a ""seasoned and highly successful business leader steeped in technology and product leadership.""

Shares in PayPal climbed in early U.S. trading, although they have fallen by over 39% over the past one-year period.

PayPal, which has seen a crush of pandemic-era online spending abate and increased pressure from competitors like Apple (NASDAQ: ), said Chriss will be tasked with ""driving growth across the [...] platform for years to come.""

One of Chriss's earliest tests will likely be the roll-out of PayPal USD, a new stablecoin -- a type of crypto asset pegged to an asset like the U.S. dollar -- that the firm hopes will bolster its status as a key player in the digital payments sector. PayPal said it would gradually make the service available to customers in the U.S.

The move was also seen as a fresh sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency industry, which has been plagued in recent months by regulatory probes and high-profile failures. PayPal is the first major financial technology firm to pursue digital tokens as a form of payments and transfers.

Regulators and policymakers have previously strongly opposed the issuing of stablecoins by major businesses, with one particular example being the mooted launch in 2019 of Meta's (NASDAQ: ) -- known at the time as Facebook -- Libra."
2022-08-14, IANS,Cybercriminals using 'EvilProxy' phishing kit to target exec: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/cybercriminals-using-evilproxy-phishing-kit-to-target-exec-report-3770457,"New Delhi, Aug 14 (IANS) Cybercriminals are increasingly using a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) toolkit -- EvilProxy -- to pull off account takeover attacks aimed at high-ranking executives at major companies.According to cybersecurity company Proofpoint, an ongoing hybrid campaign has leveraged the service to target thousands of Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) 365 user accounts, sending approximately 1,20,000 phishing emails to hundreds of targeted organisations across the globe between March and June 2022.

Over the last six months, the researchers have observed a surge of over 100 per cent in successful cloud account takeover incidents impacting high-level executives at leading companies.

During the phishing stage of the attack, attackers employed several noteworthy techniques, such as -- brand impersonation, scan blocking, and a multi-step infection chain.

""Attackers use new advanced automation to accurately determine in real-time whether a phished user is a high-level profile, and immediately obtain access to the account, while ignoring less lucrative phished profiles,"" the researchers said.

Moreover, the report said that more than 100 organisations were targeted globally, collectively representing 1.5 million employees.

Among the hundreds of compromised users, about 39 per cent were C-level executives of which 17 per cent were Chief Financial Officers (CFO), and 9 per cent were Presidents and CEOs.

Attackers have also shown interest in lower-level management, focusing their efforts on personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35 per cent of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled.

Further, the report mentioned that the campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, evoking threat actors to grow their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kits to siphon credentials, session cookies, and one-time passwords.

Cybersecurity firm Resecurity first reported on EvilProxy in September 2022, detailing its ability to compromise user accounts associated with Apple (NASDAQ: ) iCloud, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), GoDaddy, GitHub, Google (NASDAQ: ), Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.

“At present, it is mainly engaged in the ICT final assembly business. Going forward, Hon Hai will actively deploy work in the area of key components to raise its competitiveness in India,” Liu said, as the company announced its second quarter 2022 financial results.

In addition to existing operations in the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (NS: ), the iPhone maker will also deploy more resources in Karnataka, Telangana and other states.

“Through close cooperation with central and local governments, Hon Hai will plan to establish industrial parks and optimise the business environment in terms of infrastructure, policies and laws,” Liu added.

Earlier this month, the Karnataka government and Foxconn signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an estimated investment outlay of Rs 5,000 crore generating 13,000 jobs.

These projects are in addition to the iPhone end assembly plant which the Taiwanese company has planned to set up at Devanahalli ITIR in the outskirts of Bengaluru with an investment of about Rs 14,000 crore.

Last month, the Taiwanese electronics major said it will set up a mobile phone component manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram district at an outlay of Rs 1,600 crore.

Currently Foxconn has a facility near Chennai to assemble iPhone for Apple (NASDAQ: ). Hon Hai said it will continue to implement the BOL (build-operate-localise) strategy in Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, to assist local partners to improve the supply chain and enhance indigenous competitiveness.

“We will also actively share global resources with these partners to expand the local market and share in the achievements,” the company added.

Hon Hai reported net income of NT$33 billion ($1 billion) and its operating profit missed estimates.

The company expects sales to fall this year, after previously forecasting flat revenue.

In terms of technology, Chairman Liu said that the company’s ability to provide one-stop integrated services in the AI server industry lies in its continuous investment in research and development of key technologies, especially in energy consumption and heat dissipation technologies.

As a result, India has become the second-biggest mobile phone-producing country, according to Counterpoint Research.

""In 2022, more than 98 per cent of shipments in the overall market were 'Make in India', compared to just 19 per cent when the current government took over in 2014,"" said Research Director Tarun Pathak.

""Local value addition in India currently stands at an average of more than 15 per cent, compared to the low single digits eight years ago,"" he informed.

Many companies are setting up units in the country for manufacturing mobile phones as well as components, leading to growing investments, increasing jobs and overall ecosystem development.

The government now intends to capitalise on its various schemes to make India a ‘semiconductor manufacturing and export hub’.

""Going forward, we may see increasing production, especially for smartphones, as India gears to bridge the urban-rural digital divide and also become a mobile phone exporting powerhouse,"" Pathak noted.

Under the 'Make in India' initiative, the government introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme and increased import duties on completely built units and some key components over the years to push local manufacturing and value addition.

The government introduced the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for 14 sectors, including mobile phone manufacturing.

“Due to all this, exports from India have increased. Going forward, the government is focused on making India a semiconductor hub. It has proposed a semiconductor PLI scheme and now is focusing more on infrastructure with a proposed investment of $1.4 trillion,” said senior analyst Prachir Singh.

Buoyed by friendly government policies and PLI scheme, India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile exports in the current fiscal year (FY24), driven by tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ), according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).

According to the leaker, the iPhone SE 4's design will be based on the iPhone 14 model.

It is also expected to feature Face ID and a USB-C port.

Moreover, the iPhone SE 4 will likely come with the rumoured Action button which is expected to feature on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max smartphones.

The new smartphone will only feature one rear camera, according to the leaker.

Last week, Unknownz21 described the fourth-generation iPhone SE as ""effectively an iPhone 14 derivative"".

In February this year, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had said that the iPhone SE 4 smartphone would feature a 6.1-inch OLED display and an in-house 5G baseband chip.

He had also noted that the mass production of the iPhone SE 4 is expected to go ""smoothly"" in the first half of next year.

In March, it was reported that the tech giant would use OLED panels from Chinese display supplier BOE in its upcoming fourth-generation iPhone SE smartphone model.

Around 20 million OLED screens are anticipated to be used in the iPhone SE 4 next year.

According to sources, a small set to ‘Make in India’ iPhone 15 units are likely to be exported to other countries within a short span of time from its global launch.

Other Apple suppliers in India like Pegatron and Wistron (being acquired by the Tata Group) will also assemble iPhone 15 as soon as possible, they added.

Bloomberg was first to report about the development.

Last year, Apple started assembling iPhone 14 at the Foxconn facility in India in September, a first in years when a new iPhone was assembled within weeks of its global launch in the country.

This time, the deadline has further been shifted to nearly a month early, so that the locally-assembled iPhone 15 can go on sale in the country at par with global right before the festive season, as well as can be exported fast.

Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the company has set a June quarter records in India, driven by the robust sales of iPhones.

During the company’s fiscal 2022 third quarter results, Cook said that the performance of “our new stores in India this spring exceeded our expectations”.

On a specific question on the potential of India, Cook said: “You know we did hit a June quarter revenue record in India and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first two retail stores during the quarter and of course it’s early going currently, but they are currently beating our expectations in terms of how they are doing”.

He further said that the company continues to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in its direct-to-consumer offers in the country.

“We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,” he added.

Apple, with the highest average selling price (ASP) of $929, registered a massive 61 per cent YoY growth in India in the April-June period, according to the IDC.

India is now among Apple’s top 5 markets globally as the iPhone maker continued to lead the ultra-premium segment (Rs 45,000 and above).

According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Two iPhone owners who objected to the settlement have lost their appeal in the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals over its terms, removing the final obstacle to the deal, reports The Mercury News.

The iPhone maker in 2020 agreed to pay up to $500 million to resolve the lawsuit.

According to the 2018 lawsuit, consumers complained their phones were shutting off even though the batteries showed a charge of more than 30 per cent.

The devices at issue were iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, and SE devices running operating systems iOS 10.2.1 or later before December 21, 2017, and iPhone 7 and 7 Plus phones running iOS 11.2 or later before that date.

Apple was yet to comment on the development.

The law firm Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy representing Apple customers, said that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed an appeal challenging the historic agreement with Apple to settle a nationwide class-action.

After years of litigation, the team at CPM, along with co-lead counsel, Kaplan Fox, successfully negotiated the settlement -- the largest all-cash recovery in a computer intrusion case in history -- on behalf of a class of approximately 100 million iPhone users.

“The settlement is the result of years of investigation and hotly contested litigation. We are extremely proud that this deal has been approved, and following the Ninth Circuit’s order, we can finally provide immediate cash payments to impacted Apple customers,” said Mark C. Molumphy, a partner at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy.

Stern, who most recently served as vice president of services at Apple, overseeing Apple TV+, iCloud and Apple News+, will be president of “Ford Integrated Services” effective immediately.

Chriss, currently a senior executive at software firm Intuit (NASDAQ: ), will take over at PayPal on September 27. He will replace outgoing boss Dan Schulman, who will remain on the board of the company until its annual stockholder meeting next May.

PayPal said Chriss had the ""unanimous support"" of its board, calling him a ""seasoned and highly successful business leader steeped in technology and product leadership.""

Shares in PayPal climbed in early U.S. trading, although they have fallen by over 39% over the past one-year period.

PayPal, which has seen a crush of pandemic-era online spending abate and increased pressure from competitors like Apple (NASDAQ: ), said Chriss will be tasked with ""driving growth across the [...] platform for years to come.""

One of Chriss's earliest tests will likely be the roll-out of PayPal USD, a new stablecoin -- a type of crypto asset pegged to an asset like the U.S. dollar -- that the firm hopes will bolster its status as a key player in the digital payments sector. PayPal said it would gradually make the service available to customers in the U.S.

The move was also seen as a fresh sign of confidence in the cryptocurrency industry, which has been plagued in recent months by regulatory probes and high-profile failures. PayPal is the first major financial technology firm to pursue digital tokens as a form of payments and transfers.

Over the last six months, the researchers have observed a surge of over 100 per cent in successful cloud account takeover incidents impacting high-level executives at leading companies.

During the phishing stage of the attack, attackers employed several noteworthy techniques, such as -- brand impersonation, scan blocking, and a multi-step infection chain.

""Attackers use new advanced automation to accurately determine in real-time whether a phished user is a high-level profile, and immediately obtain access to the account, while ignoring less lucrative phished profiles,"" the researchers said.

Moreover, the report said that more than 100 organisations were targeted globally, collectively representing 1.5 million employees.

Among the hundreds of compromised users, about 39 per cent were C-level executives of which 17 per cent were Chief Financial Officers (CFO), and 9 per cent were Presidents and CEOs.

Attackers have also shown interest in lower-level management, focusing their efforts on personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35 per cent of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled.

Further, the report mentioned that the campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, evoking threat actors to grow their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kits to siphon credentials, session cookies, and one-time passwords.

Cybersecurity firm Resecurity first reported on EvilProxy in September 2022, detailing its ability to compromise user accounts associated with Apple (NASDAQ: ) iCloud, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), GoDaddy, GitHub, Google (NASDAQ: ), Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.

“At present, it is mainly engaged in the ICT final assembly business. Going forward, Hon Hai will actively deploy work in the area of key components to raise its competitiveness in India,” Liu said, as the company announced its second quarter 2022 financial results.

In addition to existing operations in the Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (NS: ), the iPhone maker will also deploy more resources in Karnataka, Telangana and other states.

“Through close cooperation with central and local governments, Hon Hai will plan to establish industrial parks and optimise the business environment in terms of infrastructure, policies and laws,” Liu added.

Earlier this month, the Karnataka government and Foxconn signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with an estimated investment outlay of Rs 5,000 crore generating 13,000 jobs.

These projects are in addition to the iPhone end assembly plant which the Taiwanese company has planned to set up at Devanahalli ITIR in the outskirts of Bengaluru with an investment of about Rs 14,000 crore.

Last month, the Taiwanese electronics major said it will set up a mobile phone component manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram district at an outlay of Rs 1,600 crore.

Currently Foxconn has a facility near Chennai to assemble iPhone for Apple (NASDAQ: ). Hon Hai said it will continue to implement the BOL (build-operate-localise) strategy in Southeast Asia, including in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, to assist local partners to improve the supply chain and enhance indigenous competitiveness.

“We will also actively share global resources with these partners to expand the local market and share in the achievements,” the company added.

Hon Hai reported net income of NT$33 billion ($1 billion) and its operating profit missed estimates.

The company expects sales to fall this year, after previously forecasting flat revenue.

In terms of technology, Chairman Liu said that the company’s ability to provide one-stop integrated services in the AI server industry lies in its continuous investment in research and development of key technologies, especially in energy consumption and heat dissipation technologies.

As a result, India has become the second-biggest mobile phone-producing country, according to Counterpoint Research.

""In 2022, more than 98 per cent of shipments in the overall market were 'Make in India', compared to just 19 per cent when the current government took over in 2014,"" said Research Director Tarun Pathak.

""Local value addition in India currently stands at an average of more than 15 per cent, compared to the low single digits eight years ago,"" he informed.

Many companies are setting up units in the country for manufacturing mobile phones as well as components, leading to growing investments, increasing jobs and overall ecosystem development.

The government now intends to capitalise on its various schemes to make India a ‘semiconductor manufacturing and export hub’.

""Going forward, we may see increasing production, especially for smartphones, as India gears to bridge the urban-rural digital divide and also become a mobile phone exporting powerhouse,"" Pathak noted.

Under the 'Make in India' initiative, the government introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme and increased import duties on completely built units and some key components over the years to push local manufacturing and value addition.

The government introduced the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for 14 sectors, including mobile phone manufacturing.

“Due to all this, exports from India have increased. Going forward, the government is focused on making India a semiconductor hub. It has proposed a semiconductor PLI scheme and now is focusing more on infrastructure with a proposed investment of $1.4 trillion,” said senior analyst Prachir Singh.

Buoyed by friendly government policies and PLI scheme, India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile exports in the current fiscal year (FY24), driven by tech giant Apple (NASDAQ: ), according to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA).

Hislop was ready for the situation as she had hidden an AirTag in her car.

After watching the AirTag signal move through city traffic, Hislop used it the next day to locate the vehicle she believed was hers.

When she got to the Kelowna winery where the AirTag was located, she realised that the thief was clever enough to find the AirTag and attach it to an Evo Car Share vehicle.

Although she couldn't use AirTag to monitor her car while it was stolen, the Vancouver police eventually located it with minimal damage.

""I want this person to get their karma because we work hard for our things and it's not fair that some people think they can cheat and just take,"" said Hislop.

In a note, the analysts said 70% of the tech giant's manufacturing locations and an estimated 90% or more of its assembly production capacity are now in China. Meanwhile, Bernstein's analysis suggests that China is also home to 40% of the manufacturing sites used by Apple's component suppliers.

The iPhone maker could subsequently become too reliant on the country to assemble its items, the analysts flagged. To mitigate this risk, they said that the company may choose to move a portion of its supply chain from China to destinations like India and Vietnam, although this process could last for some time.

""While Apple appears committed to diversifying its manufacturing base, we believe it could take 3 [to] 5 years to migrate 25% of Apple’s final assembly outside China,"" the analysts wrote.

They also warned that such an abrupt migration could lead to a consumer or political backlash against Apple in China -- a market that accounts for nearly a fifth of its global revenues. These problems could magnify should already strained trade relations between the U.S. and China become worse, the analysts noted.

This week, tensions intensified after the Biden administration rolled out a new ban on some investments into Chinese firms that specialize in sensitive technologies like semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence.

Hislop was ready for the situation as she had hidden an AirTag in her car.

After watching the AirTag signal move through city traffic, Hislop used it the next day to locate the vehicle she believed was hers.

When she got to the Kelowna winery where the AirTag was located, she realised that the thief was clever enough to find the AirTag and attach it to an Evo Car Share vehicle.

Although she couldn't use AirTag to monitor her car while it was stolen, the Vancouver police eventually located it with minimal damage.

""I want this person to get their karma because we work hard for our things and it's not fair that some people think they can cheat and just take,"" said Hislop.

Last month, four people were accused of stealing a car and killing the driver, after the victim attempted to recover the vehicle using AirTag, the report said.

When editing a body of text on ChromeOS, Orca will show up in the right-click menu.

If users choose Orca, a ""bubble"" with the Mako UI will appear over the screen.

According to the code, Mako will have three main tasks.

First, it will have the ability to ""request rewrites"" of a certain text, presumably one that an AI has rewritten.

""Secondly, it can offer a list of 'preset text queries', which we assume, in the context of generative AI, to be example prompts for how to ask for a certain style,"" the report said.

Lastly, Mako can ""insert"" the revised text into the original text, exactly where users left it off.

On the other hand, Manta will likely send users' original text and prompt to Google's servers, which will send back the AI-enhanced version, the report said.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the tech giant is planning to introduce a new feature for Android that will allow users to link their various Android devices together, similar to Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Continuity feature.

It could enable features including ""Call Switching"", which will allow users to switch between connected devices during calls, and ""Internet Sharing"", which could allow users to quickly set up a personal hotspot across the connected devices.

""You may soon be able to 'link your [Android] devices' signed into the same Google account together. This will enable 'call switching', which lets you switch between devices for calls, as well as 'Internet sharing',"" Rahman posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday.

It could enable features including ""Call Switching"", which allows users to switch between connected devices during calls, and ""Internet Sharing"", which could allow users to quickly set up a personal hotspot across the connected devices, as per Android Authority.

Rahman claimed that the new ""Link Your Devices"" menu will appear under Settings > Google > Devices & Sharing once the feature officially rolls out.

Apple has a similar feature called ""iPhone Mobile Calls"" that lets users make and receive calls from other Apple devices signed into the same Apple ID, as long as they're on the same network as the user's iPhone.

Meanwhile, Google has announced that it is rolling out a new feature that allows users to highlight or emphasise key content while they present in Google Slides.

""With the new pen tool, you can circle, underline, draw connections or make quick notes directly on your presentation,"" the company said in a Workspace Updates blogpost.

There was no cell service available at their location, so they used Emergency SOS to communicate with first responders.

""My brother's girlfriend's cousin and his family were caught in their vehicle in Maui while the wildfires suddenly erupted around them. No cell service, so Apple (NASDAQ: ) Emergency SOS was the only way they could get in contact with first responders. Literally saved their lives,"" he wrote.

Miraflor also shared a screenshot of the entire Emergency SOS text chain, showing the local fire department and dispatchers in action.

The family was found at the Outlets of Maui, a shopping mall in Lahaina near the fires.

In the text thread, the family's current location was transmitted to the dispatcher, and they were able to communicate that they are surrounded by fire with no visibility and no way out due to blocked roads.

Firefighters were able to reach the family and safely evacuate them within 30 minutes because of the Emergency SOS via Satellite feature.

Last month, the Emergency SOS via satellite feature on the iPhone helped to save two tourists who got lost in the mountains of Italy.

During an outing in the Apennine Mountains, the hikers got lost in an area without a cellphone signal, reports AppleInsider.

Luckily, they had an iPhone 14 which provided them the option to call for help via a satellite text message.

They were then rescued by the local fire department.

""Apple TV app is the new home of iTunes Movie Trailers,"" reads the banner on the top of the Movie Trailers app.

Since then, the same banner has appeared on both Apple's iOS and tvOS apps with the same name.

Moreover, the report mentioned that some Apple TV users in the US reported seeing a new section in the TV app titled ""Watch the Latest Trailers,"" with

a main selection card displaying the original iTunes Movie Trailers logo, but titled ""Movie & TV Trailers"".

The new section in the TV app has not yet visible for users in the UK, and possibly elsewhere, and when iPhone and iPad users in the UK tap the banner

in the original iTunes Movie Trailers app, they are redirected to the app, implying that Apple has not yet completed the merge, the report said.

The app was launched on iOS in the US in 2011, providing iPhone and iPad users with easy access to Apple's library of movie trailers.

Meanwhile, Apple shut down its 'My Photo Stream' service on July 26.

My Photo Stream was a free service that uploads the last 30 days of images (up to 1,000) to iCloud, making them accessible on the iPhone, iPad, iPod

touch, Mac, and PC.

In January, Apple permanently shut down its popular weather application 'Dark Sky'.

In a note, the analysts said 70% of the tech giant's manufacturing locations and an estimated 90% or more of its assembly production capacity are now in China. Meanwhile, Bernstein's analysis suggests that China is also home to 40% of the manufacturing sites used by Apple's component suppliers.

The iPhone maker could subsequently become too reliant on the country to assemble its items, the analysts flagged. To mitigate this risk, they said that the company may choose to move a portion of its supply chain from China to destinations like India and Vietnam, although this process could last for some time.

""While Apple appears committed to diversifying its manufacturing base, we believe it could take 3 [to] 5 years to migrate 25% of Apple’s final assembly outside China,"" the analysts wrote.

They also warned that such an abrupt migration could lead to a consumer or political backlash against Apple in China -- a market that accounts for nearly a fifth of its global revenues. These problems could magnify should already strained trade relations between the U.S. and China become worse, the analysts noted.

This week, tensions intensified after the Biden administration rolled out a new ban on some investments into Chinese firms that specialize in sensitive technologies like semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Officials in China later hinted that they could retaliate against the move."

According to reports, some 44 companies, including some leading global players, have submitted applications for incentives under the production-linked incentive (PLI) 2.0 scheme for hardware.

According to the notification by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), for clearance of import consignments with effect from November 1, 2022, a valid licence for restricted imports is required.

The government has told tech companies that the restrictions are not to ban imports but to promote exports via domestic manufacturing, according to industry representatives who attended the meeting.

The Economic Times was first to report on the development.

The Central government earlier deferred its decision to restrict the import of certain categories of laptops and computers until November 1, allowing companies three-months time to import these devices.

Post November 1, no entity will be allowed to import laptops, computers, and related items without a license.

""Import consignments can be cleared till October 31, 2022, without a licence for restricted imports,"" the notification said, adding that liberal transitional arrangements will be notified for the import of laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers, and servers till October 31.

This is a partial reversal from its August 3 order, which had imposed import restrictions on these devices with immediate effect.

The Centre has said the restrictions were imposed for security reasons and also for promoting the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat’ mission.

Ackerman's book 'The Tetris Effect: The Game That Mesmerized the World', published in 2016, delves into the hit game's origins in the former Soviet Union and the battle for global licencing rights, reports The Wrap.

""Ackerman's book took a unique approach to writing about the real history of Tetris, as it not only applied the historical record but also layered his own original research and ingenuity to create a compelling narrative non-fiction book in the style of a Cold War spy thriller,"" according to the lawsuit.

""Ackerman’s literary masterpiece, unlike other articles and writings, dispelled of the emphasis on the actual gameplay and fans, and instead concentrated on the surrounding narrative, action sequences, and adversarial relationship between the players,"" it added.

Moreover, the report mentioned that the lawsuit demanded at least $4.8 million in damages from Apple and the other parties involved, or 6 per cent of the film's estimated $80,000,000 production budget.

It also alleged copyright infringement, unfair competition and tortious interference with business relations.

Further, the editor-in-chief claimed that Apple, the Tetris Company, the Tetris rights holder, as well as the producers and screenwriter Noah Pink, recreated ""the exact same feel, tone, approach, and scenes as the book introduced several years prior"".

In the lawsuit, he also claimed that ""the Tetris film is substantially similar in almost all material respects, including specific chapters and pages of said book that were simply adopted from the book to the film, without Plaintiff's knowledge, authorisation, or consent"".

Tetris premiered on Apple TV in March. The film starred British actor Taron Egerton as Henk Rogers and Russian actor Nikita Efremov as the game’s inventor -- Alexey Pajitnov.

However, the Discovery Station might help close this gap, reports AppleInsider.

On Monday, the new Discovery Station arrived for users without any kind of popup or official announcement. Users can see the new option under the ""Listen Now"" tab in the category ""Stations for You.""

The Discovery Station seems to be an algorithmically-generated station designed to play music the listener hasn't heard but could like. So, it works similarly to the New Music Mix playlist but with continuous playback. This kind of algorithm-based continuous listening experience for music discovery was missing from Apple Music. The user's preferences were not taken into account when running stations based on genre, performers or songs.

""Apple may not officially announce this new station but may instead mention it in update notes in a future iOS release,"" the report said.

According to the cybersecurity firm Sophos, scammers were able to sneak seven new fake cryptocurrency investment apps into the official Apple (NASDAQ: ) App and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play stores, upping the potential for victims.

The researchers first learned of CryptoRom scammers using the AI chat tool -- most likely ChatGPT -- when a conned victim reached out to the team.

After contacting the victim on Tandem, a language-sharing app that has also been used as a dating app, the scammer convinced the victim to move their conversation to WhatsApp. The victim became suspicious after he received a lengthy message that was clearly partly written by an AI chat tool using a large language model (LLM), the report said.

""Since OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, there has been broad speculation that cybercriminals may use the program for their own malicious activities. We can now say that, at least in the case of pig butchering scams, this is, in fact, happening,"" said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher, Sophos.

The researchers also uncovered a new scammer tactic designed to extort additional money. Traditionally, when victims of CryptoRom scams attempt to cash in on their ""profits"", fraudsters will tell them they need to pay a 20 per cent tax on their funds before completing any withdrawals. However, a recent victim revealed that after paying the ""tax"" to withdraw money, the fraudsters said the funds had been ""hacked"" and they would need another 20 per cent deposit before receiving the funds, according to the report.

Upon further investigation, the experts found seven fake cryptocurrency investment apps in the official Google Play and Apple App stores. These apps have seemingly benign descriptions in the app stores (BerryX, for example, claims to be reading-related).

However, as soon as users open the app, they are met with a fake crypto-trading interface, the report mentioned.

In a note to clients, the analysts raised their price target for Berkshire Hathaway class B shares to $414 from $405, adding that they believe the stock trades at around an 11% discount to its intrinsic value. The UBS analysts also raised their price target for Berkshire's Class A (NYSE: ) shares to $621,591 from $608,000.

The announcement comes after Berkshire reported a 6.6% increase in operating earnings to $10.04 billion, thanks in large part to strength in insurance underwriting and net interest income. A recent spike in interest rates by the has benefited premiums on insurance policies, which have in turn helped fund Berkshire's various investments.

Buffett told CNBC after the earnings that Berkshire would continue to purchase short-term Treasuries despite an unexpected downgrade of the U.S. credit rating last week by ratings agency Fitch. Berkshire has bought this government debt to cover catastrophic insurance losses and fuel the firm's reserves for potential acquisitions.

Berkshire's cash pile grew to almost $147.38B as of the final day of June, approaching a record high of $149B.

The Omaha-based company posted a net profit of $35.9B during the April to June period, rebounding from a loss of $43.6B in the corresponding timeframe last year. Some of the uptick reflects an almost $26B unrealized gain from its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: ) that was sparked by an almost 18% surge in the tech giant's shares in the quarter.

Rosenblatt downgrades Apple following mixed Q3

Rosenblatt downgraded Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $198.00, following the company’s mixed , highlighted by EPS/revenue beat but weaker iPhone sales. As a result, shares fell more than 4% on Friday.

The firm noted that Apple's recent quarterly performance indicates a slowing phase.

Apple makes the most important device of the modern economy - the iPhone - has executed an impressive upgrade to Macs with the pivot to Apple Silicon, and is re-accelerating services. But a slowdown in the U.S. seems likely to last until a material new product category takes hold.

The uncertainty regarding when this new product will arrive and its potential success makes the stock less appealing, given it is now trading at near-peak absolute and relative multiples.

Amazon gets upgraded at two firms following a Q2 beat

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) earned two upgrades following better-than-expected and strong guidance, which drove the share more than 8% on Friday.

Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the company to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $140.00.

Meanwhile, Rosenblatt upgraded to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $184.00 from $111.00.

Rosenblatt’s previous worries that Street expectations were overly positive have abated. With the company shifting its focus towards efficiency in retail and AI becoming a key factor in cloud services, the potential economic challenges seem less concerning. This opens up opportunities for higher multiple consumer growth stories.

Guggenheim downgrades Cloudflare after Q2 beat

Cloudflare (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after Guggenheim downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $50.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

According to the firm, meeting the expectations, as guided, will be challenging unless the overall economic environment, which the company's management described as a ""grind"", sees significant improvement.

2 more analyst rating moves

CFRA downgraded General Motors (NYSE: ) to Strong Sell from Hold and cut its price target to $28.00 from $40.00.

We move to Strong Sell on the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ahead of the September 14 expiration of the current UAW contract.

Piper Sandler upgraded Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $63.00 (from $60.00), expecting the company to continue to be well-positioned. As a result, shares gained more than 2% premarket today.

The entertainment sector is set to become the week’s focus, with Walt Disney (NYSE: ), News Corp (NASDAQ: ), and Fox (NASDAQ: ) are all expected to report tough conditions.

2022-08-07, Investing.com,"U.S. CPI and earnings ahead, 'Barbie' tops $1 bn - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-cpi-and-earnings-ahead-barbie-tops-1-bn--whats-moving-markets-3759070,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise, hinting at a rebound from weekly declines on Wall Street, as investors gear up for key inflation data later in the week as well as the final leg of the latest quarterly earnings season. Meanwhile, ""Barbie"" surpasses $1 billion in global ticket sales.

1. Futures higher as inflation data looms

U.S. stock futures pointed higher Monday as investors looked ahead to the release of key monthly inflation figures later in the week and prepared for more corporate earnings.

By 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), the contract gained 74 points or 0.21%, added 15 points or 0.33%, and rose by 69 points or 0.45%.

The main indices on Wall Street fell to end the previous trading week, with the benchmark and tech-heavy slipping to their fourth-consecutive day of declines -- the longest losing streak since May. Data showing weaker-than-anticipated growth in July, as well as disappointing hardware sales from tech behemoth Apple (NASDAQ: ), both factored into market sentiment.

Highlighting the economic agenda this week is the U.S. consumer price index for July, which could give traders further insight into the potential policy path ahead for the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to publish its third-quarter results on Wednesday (see below).

2. Headline inflation seen accelerating

Economists predict that inflation in the U.S. grew at a faster pace for the first time since June 2022 last month, possibly complicating the emerging narrative of easing price growth in the world's largest economy.

The (CPI) for July is expected to accelerate to 3.3% annually, up from 3.0% in the prior month. , the reading is seen holding steady at 0.2%.

Thursday's CPI print will also include the so-called ""core"" figure stripping out volatile items like food and energy. The is projected to slow to 4.7% year-on-year and stay unchanged at on a monthly basis.

Federal Reserve officials, who previously said that their upcoming policy decisions would be ""data-dependent,"" will likely be paying close attention to the numbers.

Corralling inflation back down to the 's 2% target has been the major focus of the central bank's more than year-long campaign of interest rate hikes, and data since last summer suggest that the tightening has helped to tamp down prices. Yet, policymakers have signaled that they remain willing to roll out further rate increases should inflation show signs that it is climbing once again.

3. Earnings season marches on

Investment management giant KKR (NYSE: ), software group Palantir (NYSE: ), and entertainment firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ: ) will make up some of the biggest companies unveiling their latest quarterly results on Monday.

The returns will kick off the final stretch of the second-quarter earnings season. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, more than 84% of the businesses in the S&P 500 have already reported, with about four-fifths of these numbers topping Wall Street expectations.

Walt Disney may likely be one of the major headliners later in the week.

Investors will be keen to hear more about chief executive Bob Iger's plans to reignite performance at the media conglomerate's movie studios after a series of recent box office disappointments like ""Elemental"" and ""Haunted Mansion."" Iger may also face questions around ESPN after reports surfaced that he brought on two former lieutenants to help explore strategic options for Disney's vaunted sports network.

4. 'Barbie' soars above $1B

It's a ""Barbie"" world, indeed.

""Barbie"" has raked in more than $1B in ticket sales worldwide just 17 days after its debut, according to a unit of distributor Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: ).

In a statement, the studio said Greta Gerwig's pink-splashed fantasy comedy took home $459.4 million in North America and $572.1M overseas. The figures were later confirmed by media analytics group Comscore.

It also makes Gerwig the first-ever woman to solo-direct a billion-dollar picture.

Warner Bros. executives Jeff Goldstein and Andrew Cripps said they were ""rendered speechless"" by the success of the film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the titular doll and her frustrated counterpart Ken. Goldstein and Cripps noted that the returns have ""blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water.""

""Barbie,"" which was aided by a massive marketing campaign and an Internet phenomenon that paired it with Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer,"" is now the sixth movie to surpass the billion-dollar box office mark since the pandemic.

5. Crude hovers around four-month high

Oil prices edged lower Monday but remained near their highest levels since mid-April after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announced plans late last week to extend output reductions for another month to tighten global markets further.

Along with the production cuts from Riyadh and Moscow, traders will be eyeing Chinese economic data this week to gauge how much government stimulus may be needed to boost a waning post-pandemic recovery in the world's biggest crude importer.

By 05:06 ET, the futures contract traded 0.66% lower at $82.27 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.57% to $85.75.

Both contracts recorded their sixth consecutive weekly gains last week, the longest winning streak since December 2021 to January 2022."

Ackerman's book 'The Tetris Effect: The Game That Mesmerized the World', published in 2016, delves into the hit game's origins in the former Soviet Union and the battle for global licencing rights, reports The Wrap.

""Ackerman's book took a unique approach to writing about the real history of Tetris, as it not only applied the historical record but also layered his own original research and ingenuity to create a compelling narrative non-fiction book in the style of a Cold War spy thriller,"" according to the lawsuit.

""Ackerman’s literary masterpiece, unlike other articles and writings, dispelled of the emphasis on the actual gameplay and fans, and instead concentrated on the surrounding narrative, action sequences, and adversarial relationship between the players,"" it added.

Tetris premiered on Apple TV in March. The film starred British actor Taron Egerton as Henk Rogers and Russian actor Nikita Efremov as the game’s inventor -- Alexey Pajitnov.

""Since OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, there has been broad speculation that cybercriminals may use the program for their own malicious activities. We can now say that, at least in the case of pig butchering scams, this is, in fact, happening,"" said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher, Sophos.

The researchers also uncovered a new scammer tactic designed to extort additional money. Traditionally, when victims of CryptoRom scams attempt to cash in on their ""profits"", fraudsters will tell them they need to pay a 20 per cent tax on their funds before completing any withdrawals. However, a recent victim revealed that after paying the ""tax"" to withdraw money, the fraudsters said the funds had been ""hacked"" and they would need another 20 per cent deposit before receiving the funds, according to the report.

Upon further investigation, the experts found seven fake cryptocurrency investment apps in the official Google Play and Apple App stores. These apps have seemingly benign descriptions in the app stores (BerryX, for example, claims to be reading-related).

However, as soon as users open the app, they are met with a fake crypto-trading interface, the report mentioned.

2022-08-07, Investing.com,UBS: Berkshire Hathaway shares 'attractive' in an uncertain economic environment,https://in.investing.com/news/ubs-berkshire-hathaway-shares-attractive-in-an-uncertain-economic-environment-3759740,"Investing.com -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) shares represent an attractive play in an uncertain macro environment, analysts at UBS said Monday, following the release of second quarter from Warren Buffett's massive conglomerate.

In a note to clients, the analysts raised their price target for Berkshire Hathaway class B shares to $414 from $405, adding that they believe the stock trades at around an 11% discount to its intrinsic value. The UBS analysts also raised their price target for Berkshire's Class A (NYSE: ) shares to $621,591 from $608,000.

The announcement comes after Berkshire reported a 6.6% increase in operating earnings to $10.04 billion, thanks in large part to strength in insurance underwriting and net interest income. A recent spike in interest rates by the has benefited premiums on insurance policies, which have in turn helped fund Berkshire's various investments.

Buffett told CNBC after the earnings that Berkshire would continue to purchase short-term Treasuries despite an unexpected downgrade of the U.S. credit rating last week by ratings agency Fitch. Berkshire has bought this government debt to cover catastrophic insurance losses and fuel the firm's reserves for potential acquisitions.

Berkshire's cash pile grew to almost $147.38B as of the final day of June, approaching a record high of $149B.

The Omaha-based company posted a net profit of $35.9B during the April to June period, rebounding from a loss of $43.6B in the corresponding timeframe last year. Some of the uptick reflects an almost $26B unrealized gain from its stake in Apple (NASDAQ: ) that was sparked by an almost 18% surge in the tech giant's shares in the quarter.

Meanwhile, Berkshire pulled back spending on share buybacks to $1.4B, down from $4.4B in the first three months of 2022."

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Rosenblatt downgrades Apple following mixed Q3

Rosenblatt downgraded Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $198.00, following the company’s mixed , highlighted by EPS/revenue beat but weaker iPhone sales. As a result, shares fell more than 4% on Friday.

The firm noted that Apple's recent quarterly performance indicates a slowing phase.

Apple makes the most important device of the modern economy - the iPhone - has executed an impressive upgrade to Macs with the pivot to Apple Silicon, and is re-accelerating services. But a slowdown in the U.S. seems likely to last until a material new product category takes hold.

The uncertainty regarding when this new product will arrive and its potential success makes the stock less appealing, given it is now trading at near-peak absolute and relative multiples.

Amazon gets upgraded at two firms following a Q2 beat

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) earned two upgrades following better-than-expected and strong guidance, which drove the share more than 8% on Friday.

Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the company to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $140.00.

Meanwhile, Rosenblatt upgraded to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $184.00 from $111.00.

Rosenblatt’s previous worries that Street expectations were overly positive have abated. With the company shifting its focus towards efficiency in retail and AI becoming a key factor in cloud services, the potential economic challenges seem less concerning. This opens up opportunities for higher multiple consumer growth stories.

Guggenheim downgrades Cloudflare after Q2 beat

Cloudflare (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after Guggenheim downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $50.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

Cloud should have always been, we believe there is certainly execution risk associated with the attainment of this, and again believe the stock has gotten way ahead of itself.

Despite a slight improvement in , which resulted in a share price surge of more than 6% on Friday, Guggenheim doesn't expect this trend to continue into the latter half of the year. According to the firm, meeting the expectations, as guided, will be challenging unless the overall economic environment, which the company's management described as a ""grind"", sees significant improvement.

2 more analyst rating moves

CFRA downgraded General Motors (NYSE: ) to Strong Sell from Hold and cut its price target to $28.00 from $40.00.

We move to Strong Sell on the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ahead of the September 14 expiration of the current UAW contract.

Piper Sandler upgraded Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $63.00 (from $60.00), expecting the company to continue to be well-positioned. As a result, shares gained more than 2% premarket today.

Its 2Q23 results were below expectations, but there is nothing concerning about the business or its near and longterm momentum.

2022-08-07, Investing.com,"U.S. CPI and earnings ahead, 'Barbie' tops $1 bn - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-cpi-and-earnings-ahead-barbie-tops-1-bn--whats-moving-markets-3759070,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise, hinting at a rebound from weekly declines on Wall Street, as investors gear up for key inflation data later in the week as well as the final leg of the latest quarterly earnings season. Meanwhile, ""Barbie"" surpasses $1 billion in global ticket sales.

1. Futures higher as inflation data looms

U.S. stock futures pointed higher Monday as investors looked ahead to the release of key monthly inflation figures later in the week and prepared for more corporate earnings.

By 05:05 ET (09:05 GMT), the contract gained 74 points or 0.21%, added 15 points or 0.33%, and rose by 69 points or 0.45%.

The main indices on Wall Street fell to end the previous trading week, with the benchmark and tech-heavy slipping to their fourth-consecutive day of declines -- the longest losing streak since May. Data showing weaker-than-anticipated growth in July, as well as disappointing hardware sales from tech behemoth Apple (NASDAQ: ), both factored into market sentiment.

Highlighting the economic agenda this week is the U.S. consumer price index for July, which could give traders further insight into the potential policy path ahead for the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to publish its third-quarter results on Wednesday (see below).

2. Headline inflation seen accelerating

Economists predict that inflation in the U.S. grew at a faster pace for the first time since June 2022 last month, possibly complicating the emerging narrative of easing price growth in the world's largest economy.

The (CPI) for July is expected to accelerate to 3.3% annually, up from 3.0% in the prior month. , the reading is seen holding steady at 0.2%.

Thursday's CPI print will also include the so-called ""core"" figure stripping out volatile items like food and energy. The is projected to slow to 4.7% year-on-year and stay unchanged at on a monthly basis.

Federal Reserve officials, who previously said that their upcoming policy decisions would be ""data-dependent,"" will likely be paying close attention to the numbers.

Corralling inflation back down to the 's 2% target has been the major focus of the central bank's more than year-long campaign of interest rate hikes, and data since last summer suggest that the tightening has helped to tamp down prices. Yet, policymakers have signaled that they remain willing to roll out further rate increases should inflation show signs that it is climbing once again.

3. Earnings season marches on

Investment management giant KKR (NYSE: ), software group Palantir (NYSE: ), and entertainment firm Paramount Global (NASDAQ: ) will make up some of the biggest companies unveiling their latest quarterly results on Monday.

The returns will kick off the final stretch of the second-quarter earnings season. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, more than 84% of the businesses in the S&P 500 have already reported, with about four-fifths of these numbers topping Wall Street expectations.

Walt Disney may likely be one of the major headliners later in the week.

Investors will be keen to hear more about chief executive Bob Iger's plans to reignite performance at the media conglomerate's movie studios after a series of recent box office disappointments like ""Elemental"" and ""Haunted Mansion."" Iger may also face questions around ESPN after reports surfaced that he brought on two former lieutenants to help explore strategic options for Disney's vaunted sports network.

4. 'Barbie' soars above $1B

It's a ""Barbie"" world, indeed.

""Barbie"" has raked in more than $1B in ticket sales worldwide just 17 days after its debut, according to a unit of distributor Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: ).

In a statement, the studio said Greta Gerwig's pink-splashed fantasy comedy took home $459.4 million in North America and $572.1M overseas. The figures were later confirmed by media analytics group Comscore.

It also makes Gerwig the first-ever woman to solo-direct a billion-dollar picture.

Warner Bros. executives Jeff Goldstein and Andrew Cripps said they were ""rendered speechless"" by the success of the film, which stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the titular doll and her frustrated counterpart Ken. Goldstein and Cripps noted that the returns have ""blown even our most optimistic predictions out of the water.""

""Barbie,"" which was aided by a massive marketing campaign and an Internet phenomenon that paired it with Christopher Nolan's biopic ""Oppenheimer,"" is now the sixth movie to surpass the billion-dollar box office mark since the pandemic.

5. Crude hovers around four-month high

Oil prices edged lower Monday but remained near their highest levels since mid-April after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia announced plans late last week to extend output reductions for another month to tighten global markets further.

Along with the production cuts from Riyadh and Moscow, traders will be eyeing Chinese economic data this week to gauge how much government stimulus may be needed to boost a waning post-pandemic recovery in the world's biggest crude importer.

By 05:06 ET, the futures contract traded 0.66% lower at $82.27 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.57% to $85.75.

Both contracts recorded their sixth consecutive weekly gains last week, the longest winning streak since December 2021 to January 2022."

The photos show back covers with three buttons on the left-hand side, with two lower buttons that are bigger than the third button that is higher and slightly recessed.

2022-08-06, IANS,iPhone 16 Pro models may feature stacked camera sensor design: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/iphone-16-pro-models-may-feature-stacked-camera-sensor-design-report-3758359,"San Francisco, Aug 6 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will reportedly adopt a stacked rear camera sensor design across its iPhone 16 series next year, following similar moves in this year's iPhone 15 models.According to Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, two iPhone 16 Pro models will adopt a stacked CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) design.

The camera's stacked CIS design lets it capture more light, have a wider dynamic range, and perform better in low-light circumstances.

Apple is already rumoured to adopt a stacked sensor arrangement for the 48MP wide camera on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.

Sony, which provides high-end sensors, increased production capacity by 100-120 per cent to meet Apple's demand.

""Following two 2H23 iPhone 15 standard models, two 2H24 iPhone 16 Pro models will also adopt stacked-designed CIS, so Sony's high-end CIS capacity will continue to be tight in 2024, benefiting Will Semi to continue to obtain more orders for high-end CIS from Chinese smartphone brands (design-in & design-win),"" Kuo said in a Medium post.

Sony's limited capacity is expected to benefit competitor Will Semi, which will receive more orders for high-end CIS from Chinese smartphone manufacturers as a result.

The iPhone 16 series is expected to release sometime in the second half of 2024.

As per the rumours, the iPhone 16 Pro Max's 48-megapixel wide-angle camera would have an eight-part hybrid lens with two glass components and six plastic elements, as well as enhancements to the telephoto and ultra-wide camera lenses.

Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly planning to unveil the iPhone 15 smartphone series on September 13.

If the tech giant does the unveiling on September 13, pre-orders should begin on September 15, following the official launch a week later on September 22, reports 9To5Mac.

For comparison, pre-orders for iPhone 14 started on September 9 last year, with the official release in stores a week later on September 16.

InvestingPro subscribers get scorching tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Amazon smashes Q2 estimates

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.

Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.

Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.

Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:

Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.

BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""

Barclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""

""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.

Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57

Apple slumps on iPhone worries

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though topped estimates.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.

Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.

As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.

Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.

In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.

Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:

We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.

Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.

AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) shares took a slide on its amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.

AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.

Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""

Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""

The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:

Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.

Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.

""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.

Qualcomm falls on soft guidance

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed amid softer smartphone demand.

The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""

CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:

Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.

Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.

PayPal plummets on gross profit worries

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.

PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.

But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.

After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""

The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""

Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:

Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?

In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.

For all of 2022, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.

Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.

2022-08-06, IANS,Apple begins hunt for generative AI talent globally,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-begins-hunt-for-generative-ai-talent-globally-3758108,"New Delhi, Aug 6 (IANS) As Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook bets big on generative AI, the tech giant has posted several job openings in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) globally.Over the last few months, the iPhone maker has posted dozens of AI jobs in the US, France, and China, looking to fill roles that could help build generative AI tools that use local processing on mobile devices, reports The Financial Times.

""We are seeking a candidate with a proven track record in applied ML research. Responsibilities in the role will include training large scale language and multimodal models on distributed backends, deployment of compact neural architectures such as transformers efficiently on device, and learning policies that can be personalised to the user in a privacy preserving manner,"" read one such posting.

Apple's job listings has revealed the possible paths for using generative AI in its devices.

Cook has also revealed that the tech giant has been working on generative AI and other models for years.

He said that Apple views artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.

""And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,"" Cook told CNBC last week, as the company reported strong June quarter results, driven by stronger services sales that grew 8 per cent (year-on-year).

""On a research basis, we've been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,"" Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and the mention of the technology that has taken the world by storm was largely missing from its quarterly report too.

Apple has crossed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on its platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions it had only 3 years ago.

2022-08-06, IANS,Apple to launch AirTag 2 in 2025: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-launch-airtag-2-in-2025-report-3758107,"San Francisco, Aug 6 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will reportedly launch its next-generation tracker 'AirTag 2' in 2025.The information came from the leaker LeaksApplePro who also said that the AirTag 2 will likely come with ""tons of new features"", including “3D Precision Finding”.

The leaker further mentioned that ""2024 estimates are a bit early according to sources.”

On August 2, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had claimed that the AirTag 2 will likely go into mass production in the fourth quarter (Q4) of this year.

""I believe that spatial computing is a new ecosystem that Apple wants to build, using Vision Pro as the core to integrate other devices, including AirTag 2,"" Kuo added.

Apple introduced AirTag in April 2021.

According to the tech giant, AirTag is a small and elegantly designed accessory that helps customers keep track of and find the items that matter most with Apple’s Find My app.

Current AirTag features precision-etched polished stainless steel, and is water and dust resistant.

It also comes with a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate AirTag, and a removable cover that makes it easy for users to replace the battery.

AirTag's use proved invaluable in reuniting many users with their lost or stolen items.

Last month, an AirTag had helped to track down a restaurant burglar who stole $15,000 worth of goods.

It was also reported that an AirTag had helped to track stolen possessions, resulting in the burglar's arrest and 15-month imprisonment term.

In June, the tracker had helped to bust robbers who stole more than $62,000 in thefts.

Meanwhile, in January this year, an AirTag had helped to rescue one-year-old Australian shepherd Seamus who got away from his owner while out for a walk and fell into a fast-flowing storm drain, by leading rescuers to his location.

The camera's stacked CIS design lets it capture more light, have a wider dynamic range, and perform better in low-light circumstances.

Apple is already rumoured to adopt a stacked sensor arrangement for the 48MP wide camera on the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.

Sony, which provides high-end sensors, increased production capacity by 100-120 per cent to meet Apple's demand.

""Following two 2H23 iPhone 15 standard models, two 2H24 iPhone 16 Pro models will also adopt stacked-designed CIS, so Sony's high-end CIS capacity will continue to be tight in 2024, benefiting Will Semi to continue to obtain more orders for high-end CIS from Chinese smartphone brands (design-in & design-win),"" Kuo said in a Medium post.

Sony's limited capacity is expected to benefit competitor Will Semi, which will receive more orders for high-end CIS from Chinese smartphone manufacturers as a result.

InvestingPro subscribers get scorching tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Amazon smashes Q2 estimates

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.

Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.

Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.

Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:

Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.

BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""

Barclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""

""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.

Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57

Apple slumps on iPhone worries

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though topped estimates.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.

Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.

As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.

Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.

In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.

Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:

We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.

Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.

AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) shares took a slide on its amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.

AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.

Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""

Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""

The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:

Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.

Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.

""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.

Qualcomm falls on soft guidance

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed amid softer smartphone demand.

The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""

CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:

Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.

Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.

PayPal plummets on gross profit worries

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.

PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.

But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.

After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""

The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""

Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:

Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?

In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.

For all of 2022, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.

Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.

2022-08-06, IANS,Apple begins hunt for generative AI talent globally,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-begins-hunt-for-generative-ai-talent-globally-3758108,"New Delhi, Aug 6 (IANS) As Apple (NASDAQ: ) CEO Tim Cook bets big on generative AI, the tech giant has posted several job openings in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) globally.Over the last few months, the iPhone maker has posted dozens of AI jobs in the US, France, and China, looking to fill roles that could help build generative AI tools that use local processing on mobile devices, reports The Financial Times.

""We are seeking a candidate with a proven track record in applied ML research. Responsibilities in the role will include training large scale language and multimodal models on distributed backends, deployment of compact neural architectures such as transformers efficiently on device, and learning policies that can be personalised to the user in a privacy preserving manner,"" read one such posting.

Apple's job listings has revealed the possible paths for using generative AI in its devices.

Cook has also revealed that the tech giant has been working on generative AI and other models for years.

He said that Apple views artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.

""And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,"" Cook told CNBC last week, as the company reported strong June quarter results, driven by stronger services sales that grew 8 per cent (year-on-year).

""On a research basis, we've been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,"" Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and the mention of the technology that has taken the world by storm was largely missing from its quarterly report too.

Apple has crossed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on its platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions it had only 3 years ago.

2022-08-06, IANS,Apple to launch AirTag 2 in 2025: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-launch-airtag-2-in-2025-report-3758107,"San Francisco, Aug 6 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will reportedly launch its next-generation tracker 'AirTag 2' in 2025.The information came from the leaker LeaksApplePro who also said that the AirTag 2 will likely come with ""tons of new features"", including “3D Precision Finding”.

The leaker further mentioned that ""2024 estimates are a bit early according to sources.”

On August 2, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had claimed that the AirTag 2 will likely go into mass production in the fourth quarter (Q4) of this year.

""I believe that spatial computing is a new ecosystem that Apple wants to build, using Vision Pro as the core to integrate other devices, including AirTag 2,"" Kuo added.

Apple introduced AirTag in April 2021.

According to the tech giant, AirTag is a small and elegantly designed accessory that helps customers keep track of and find the items that matter most with Apple’s Find My app.

Current AirTag features precision-etched polished stainless steel, and is water and dust resistant.

It also comes with a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate AirTag, and a removable cover that makes it easy for users to replace the battery.

AirTag's use proved invaluable in reuniting many users with their lost or stolen items.

Last month, an AirTag had helped to track down a restaurant burglar who stole $15,000 worth of goods.

It was also reported that an AirTag had helped to track stolen possessions, resulting in the burglar's arrest and 15-month imprisonment term.

In June, the tracker had helped to bust robbers who stole more than $62,000 in thefts.

Meanwhile, in January this year, an AirTag had helped to rescue one-year-old Australian shepherd Seamus who got away from his owner while out for a walk and fell into a fast-flowing storm drain, by leading rescuers to his location.

Still, Apple shares were down nearly 2% in premarket Friday trading.

Apple EPS of $1.26 on revenue of $81.80B, beating estimates for $1.19 and $81.73B, respectively.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of total revenue, fell to $39.67B from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B.

Gross margin of 44.5% for the quarter topped estimates of 44.2%, as the tech giant's higher-margin services business delivered record growth.

Revenue from Apple’s services business including Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, grew to $21.21B in Q3 from $19.60B a year earlier, and topped estimates of $20.76B.

""We had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said.

iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3 , missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B. Wearables, home, and accessories grew 2.5% to $8.28B year-on-year in Q3.

Apple shares were further hit after CFO Luca Maestri said on the earnings call that the company expects September quarter sales results to be similar to its June quarter performance. As sales fell 1% YoY in FQ3, this commentary would imply FQ4 sales of $89.25B, nearly $1B lower than the consensus.

On a more positive note, Meastri said that Apple expects iPhone and services YoY performance to accelerate from the June quarter.

On the back of this expected acceleration, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P 500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" they said in a note.

On the other hand, BofA analysts remain sidelined.

""We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment,"" they wrote.

""The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.""

Risk-off sentiment persisted after Fitch unexpectedly cut the U.S. sovereign rating earlier this week, which also saw investors lock in profits in markets which outperformed substantially earlier this year. India and Japan in particular saw a heavy amount of selling this week.

Japan’s index fell 0.3% on Friday, and was set to lose over 2% this week, while futures for India’s index pointed to a mildly positive open. But the Nifty was also down 1.4% for the week.

But officials once again offered no major details on the planned stimulus, which saw Chinese markets trim a bulk of their earlier gains.

While the prospect of more stimulus measures has somewhat supported Chinese stocks in recent sessions, a lack of concrete details from the government has soured investor expectations.

“If you look at it, it’s the second largest smartphone market in the world and we ought to be doing really well there and we are very pleased with our growth there,” said Cook

“We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,” he added.

Apple, with the highest average selling price (ASP) of $929, registered a massive 61 per cent YoY growth in India in April-June period, according to the IDC.

India is now among Apple’s top 5 markets globally as the iPhone maker continued to lead the ultra-premium segment (Rs 45,000 and above).

The company has also broken local manufacturing records. In May, iPhone exports reached a record Rs 10,000 crore, pushing the total mobile shipments from the country to Rs 12,000 crore in that month.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year driven by tech giant Apple.

According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Last month, Apple joined global non-profit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation.

Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO, said that the company set an all-time revenue record for iPhone in India.

“We set June quarter records and revenue growth in double digits for iPhone in India with a very strong performance there,” Maestri told the analysts.

Apple posted quarterly revenue of $81.8 billion, down 1 percent year over year.

“We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” said Cook.

During the quarter, “we generated very strong operating cash flow of $26 billion, returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, and continued to invest in our long-term growth plans,” Maestri added.

The notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Commerce Ministry notified restrictions on import of laptops, tablets, personal computers and servers.

ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told IANS that ""We assure the industry and trade that there will be no disruptions in supply chain because of this notification"".

""Above all, we assure consumers that all their loved brands will be available as always,"" he added.

The move brought cheers for domestic manufacturers while there were concerns among foreign vendors regarding the notification. Shares of Dixon Technologies surged about 6 per cent on Thursday. Following the development, its stock rose to hit a high of Rs 4,354.

Dixon Technologies offers design-focused solutions in consumer durables, home appliances, lighting, mobile phones and security devices.

Videotex Director Arjun Bajaj said they are grateful for the government's support in fostering an environment for domestic manufacturing in India by putting an import ban on laptops, tablets, PCs and other products.

""The focus now is on the potential benefits such support can bring to research and development (R&D) and the manufacturing of electronics products in the country. This highly encourages building the whole manufacturing ecosystem in the country,"" he said.

Videotex has over 50 per cent market share in smart TV ODM space among the contract manufacturers in India, with a manufacturing capacity of 1.4 million TVs per year and expanding a new unit to reach 3.2 million units.

Export of electronic goods from India increased from Rs 39,978 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,09,797 crore in 2021-22, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.39 per cent.

According to data released by the Ministry of Electronics and IT, the country's electronics export was set to reach Rs 1.76 lakh crore in 2022-23.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, said with the total laptop/PC market size close to $8 billion annually and approximately 65 per cent of units being imported, the government's move is aimed at promoting domestic production and reducing dependence on imports.

""The industry comprises around 12 million units, and this restriction may lead to some short-term supply disruptions, especially for brands like Apple (NASDAQ: ), HP, and Lenovo,” he said in a statement.

Moreover, with the festive season approaching, a significant period for sales, the industry may face challenges in meeting demand.

""However, it is worth noting that the government's strategy aligns with their recent announcement to extend the application window under the PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware, offering better incentives to encourage local manufacturing,"" Pathak added.

The new policy change came as the government earlier this week extended the window for receiving applications under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware till August 30.

The PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware was notified on May 29 with a budgetary outlay of Rs 17,000 crore. Semiconductor design, IC manufacturing, and packaging are also included as incentivised components of the PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware.

With an anticipated incremental investment of Rs 2,430 crore, the scheme aims to generate an incremental production amounting to Rs 3,35,000 crore.

On the back of this expected acceleration, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi analysts opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P 500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" they said in a note.

On the other hand, BofA analysts remain sidelined.

""We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment,"" they wrote.

""The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.""

Risk-off sentiment persisted after Fitch unexpectedly cut the U.S. sovereign rating earlier this week, which also saw investors lock in profits in markets which outperformed substantially earlier this year. India and Japan in particular saw a heavy amount of selling this week.

Japan’s index fell 0.3% on Friday, and was set to lose over 2% this week, while futures for India’s index pointed to a mildly positive open. But the Nifty was also down 1.4% for the week.

Chinese stocks rise as govt talks up stimulus measures

Chinese stocks rose past most of their regional peers on Friday, with the and indexes up 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Hong Kong’s index added 0.9% on a rebound in heavyweight technology stocks.

China’s top economic committees said in a joint statement on Friday that the government will unlock more measures to boost consumer spending and improve local liquidity. But officials once again offered no major details on the planned stimulus, which saw Chinese markets trim a bulk of their earlier gains.

While the prospect of more stimulus measures has somewhat supported Chinese stocks in recent sessions, a lack of concrete details from the government has soured investor expectations.

Business activity data released this week showed that the Chinese economy started the third quarter on a weak note, pointing to little relief after growth slowed substantially in the second quarter.

Broader Asian markets retreated on Friday, with investors remaining largely risk-averse ahead of key U.S. data due later in the day. Any signs of resilience in the jobs market give the Fed more headroom to keep raising interest rates, which bodes poorly for Asian markets.

Apple opened its own-branded Mumbai and Delhi retail stores in the country in April this year, which met with great enthusiasm.

On a specific question on the potential of India, Cook said: “You know we did hit a June quarter revenue record in India and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first two retail stores during the quarter and of course it’s early going currently, but they are currently beating our expectations in terms of how they are doing”.

He further said that the company continues to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in its direct-to-consumer offers in the country.

“If you look at it, it’s the second largest smartphone market in the world and we ought to be doing really well there and we are very pleased with our growth there,” said Cook

“We still have a very, very modest and low share in this smartphone market, so I think it’s a huge opportunity for us. And we are putting in all of our energies to make that occur,” he added.

Apple, with the highest average selling price (ASP) of $929, registered a massive 61 per cent YoY growth in India in April-June period, according to the IDC.

India is now among Apple’s top 5 markets globally as the iPhone maker continued to lead the ultra-premium segment (Rs 45,000 and above).

The company has also broken local manufacturing records. In May, iPhone exports reached a record Rs 10,000 crore, pushing the total mobile shipments from the country to Rs 12,000 crore in that month.

India is set to cross Rs 1,20,000 crore in mobile phone exports in the current fiscal year driven by tech giant Apple.

According to the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), Apple's market share is set to exceed 50 per cent in FY24.

Last month, Apple joined global non-profit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation.

Luca Maestri, Apple’s CFO, said that the company set an all-time revenue record for iPhone in India.

“We set June quarter records and revenue growth in double digits for iPhone in India with a very strong performance there,” Maestri told the analysts.

Apple posted quarterly revenue of $81.8 billion, down 1 percent year over year.

“We are happy to report that we had an all-time revenue record in Services during the June quarter, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions, and we saw continued strength in emerging markets thanks to robust sales of iPhone,” said Cook.

During the quarter, “we generated very strong operating cash flow of $26 billion, returned over $24 billion to our shareholders, and continued to invest in our long-term growth plans,” Maestri added.

The notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) under the Commerce Ministry notified restrictions on import of laptops, tablets, personal computers and servers.

ICEA Chairman Pankaj Mohindroo told IANS that ""We assure the industry and trade that there will be no disruptions in supply chain because of this notification"".

""Above all, we assure consumers that all their loved brands will be available as always,"" he added.

The move brought cheers for domestic manufacturers while there were concerns among foreign vendors regarding the notification. Shares of Dixon Technologies surged about 6 per cent on Thursday. Following the development, its stock rose to hit a high of Rs 4,354.

Dixon Technologies offers design-focused solutions in consumer durables, home appliances, lighting, mobile phones and security devices.

Videotex Director Arjun Bajaj said they are grateful for the government's support in fostering an environment for domestic manufacturing in India by putting an import ban on laptops, tablets, PCs and other products.

""The focus now is on the potential benefits such support can bring to research and development (R&D) and the manufacturing of electronics products in the country. This highly encourages building the whole manufacturing ecosystem in the country,"" he said.

Videotex has over 50 per cent market share in smart TV ODM space among the contract manufacturers in India, with a manufacturing capacity of 1.4 million TVs per year and expanding a new unit to reach 3.2 million units.

Export of electronic goods from India increased from Rs 39,978 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,09,797 crore in 2021-22, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.39 per cent.

According to data released by the Ministry of Electronics and IT, the country's electronics export was set to reach Rs 1.76 lakh crore in 2022-23.

Tarun Pathak, Research Director at Counterpoint, said with the total laptop/PC market size close to $8 billion annually and approximately 65 per cent of units being imported, the government's move is aimed at promoting domestic production and reducing dependence on imports.

""The industry comprises around 12 million units, and this restriction may lead to some short-term supply disruptions, especially for brands like Apple (NASDAQ: ), HP, and Lenovo,” he said in a statement.

Moreover, with the festive season approaching, a significant period for sales, the industry may face challenges in meeting demand.

""However, it is worth noting that the government's strategy aligns with their recent announcement to extend the application window under the PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware, offering better incentives to encourage local manufacturing,"" Pathak added.

The new policy change came as the government earlier this week extended the window for receiving applications under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware till August 30.

The PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware was notified on May 29 with a budgetary outlay of Rs 17,000 crore. Semiconductor design, IC manufacturing, and packaging are also included as incentivised components of the PLI Scheme 2.0 for IT Hardware.

With an anticipated incremental investment of Rs 2,430 crore, the scheme aims to generate an incremental production amounting to Rs 3,35,000 crore.

“As AI use cases proliferate to the edge, on-device AI has the potential to drive an inflection point across all our products. Qualcomm remains best positioned to lead this transition given the unmatched accelerated computing performance with the power efficiency of our platforms.”

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2.00 on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $8.77B.

CFRA analysts lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock.

""Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24,"" they wrote.

Current AirTag features precision-etched polished stainless steel, and is water and dust resistant.

It also comes with a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate AirTag, and a removable cover that makes it easy for users to replace the battery.

AirTag's use proved invaluable in reuniting many users with their lost or stolen items.

Last month, an AirTag had helped to track down a restaurant burglar who stole $15,000 worth of goods.

In June, the tracker had helped to bust robbers who stole more than $62,000 in thefts.

In January this year, an AirTag had helped to rescue one-year-old Australian shepherd who got away from his owner while out for a walk and fell into a fast-flowing storm drain, by leading rescuers to his location.

""While we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10 per cent, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10 per cent. First 12 months is still free for all.""

""Apple does take 30 per cent, but I will speak with @tim_cook and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30 per cent of what X keeps in order to maximise what creators receive,"" he added.

Several users expressed their thoughts and suggestions on Musk's post.

When a user said, ""It’s true. I think it would be helpful to be able to change the price on paid subscriptions. Is that going to be rolled out soon?"" Musk replied: ""Yeah, that’s coming soon.""

In response to another post about approving subscriptions faster, the X-owner said, ""Will do.""

The company was also working on tips that would help small creators who don’t fit the current monetisation parameters to get paid for posting good content.

Earlier this week, Twitter was renamed to X on the iOS App Store, indicating that Apple gave the app special treatment to permit a one-character name.

The exception might be a signal that Musk and the iPhone maker desire to put the past behind them.

In November last year, Musk had accused Apple of threatening to remove the Twitter app from the store.

However, after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk later said it was a “misunderstanding"".

Meanwhile, Musk on Thursday announced that verified users can now download videos if the content creator allows it, by tapping the three dots on the upper right when videos are in the full-screen mode.

""We will soon allow this simply by tapping & holding on a video just like you download a picture,"" he added.

2022-08-03, Investing.com,Asian stocks fall as risk-off persists after U.S. rating cut,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-as-riskoff-persists-after-us-rating-cut-3753041,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street after Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating somewhat dented sentiment, while strong payrolls data also pushed up concerns over rising interest rates.

Fitch had earlier this week downgraded its rating for the U.S. government to AA+ from AAA, citing concerns over fiscal spending and increased clashes between the Democrats and Republicans.

While analysts downplayed the direct impact of the downgrade, the move still triggered a wave of selling across global stock markets, as investors locked in profits after a strong run through June and July.

Technology stocks see extended profit taking, strong payrolls data weighs

Tech stocks, which had seen strong gains over the past two months, bore the brunt of selling pressure, with South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s index falling 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.

Stocks were also rattled by stronger-than-expected U.S. data on Wednesday, which boosted the dollar and Treasury yields as markets positioned for a similar reading from official data due on Friday.

Resilience in the U.S. economy - particularly in the labor market - gives the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep raising interest rates, which bodes poorly for risk-driven stock markets.

Tech stockholders were also on edge ahead of earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Broader Asian markets retreated. Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the index sliding 1.6%, while the broader fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan’s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.

Australia’s fell 0.5% as data showed that the country’s remained steady in June. Australian also fell less than expected in the second quarter.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a slightly positive open, after the index plummeted from record highs this week. High weightage of technology stocks weighed heavily on the Nifty and the in recent sessions.

Chinese stocks limit losses as PMI data signals some strength

China’s and indexes fell less than their peers on Thursday, as a showed that the country’s services sector grew more than expected in July.

The reading indicated that steady retail spending and services demand was still keeping some facets of Chinese business activity afloat, and could help support a bigger economic recovery this year, especially if the government rolls out more stimulus measures.

But investors appear to have somewhat soured on the prospect of more Chinese stimulus, given that officials have offered up few details on how the measures will be carried out. The country's biggest economic engines - manufacturing and real estate - are also struggling despite promises of more support."

Tech stocks have been rallying all year on the prospect of easing conditions for interest rates. Fitch downgraded the U.S. on Tuesday night, citing increased polarity in Washington over debt ceiling and other negotiations that point to a deterioration in governance standards. The Treasury Department pushed back at the firm's assertions.

Still, it was enough to weigh on markets amid a deluge of corporate earnings reports this week.

After raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July, the Fed could be at or near the end of its rate hiking plans. It doesn't meet again about interest rates until September, and futures traders are not unanimous on when or whether another rate hike could come. Some see rates rising another quarter of a percentage point in September, some see it in November.

Fed officials meet later this month for their annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where top policy makers could provide some details on where they see the economy headed in the second half of the year.

On Fortune's authoritative ranking of the (current) corporate world order, the Arkansas-based retailer claimed No. 1 for the 10th consecutive year and for the 18th time since 1995.

Walmart joins a spike in the number of US companies on the Global 500 this year, reaching its highest total since 2010 at 136 companies, which is also the highest for a stand-alone country.

The strength of the global energy sector was dramatically clear as Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ) nearly knocked the retail Goliath from its perch.

Saudi Aramco (No. 2) benefited from soaring energy prices -- fueled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- that also propelled Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) (No. 7) and Shell (No. 9) back into the top 10 by revenue. In profits, Saudi Aramco earned $159 billion, the highest annual total ever for a Fortune Global 500 company.

Big Tech, meanwhile, proved it also remains a robust and profitable sector. Together, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) brought in $233 billion in net income, with Apple (No. 8) earning just short of $100 billion in profits, the most ever by a US company.

There were 39 newcomers to this year's Fortune Global 500, including 23 companies making their debut, such as Warner Bros. Discovery (No. 449), plus first time Chinese companies, Contemporary Amperex Technology (No. 292) and Meituan (No. 467).

By geography, Chinese companies in total – Greater China: mainland China including Hong Kong, and adding Taiwan – top this year's Global 500 with 142 companies.

But the 136 US companies generated more revenue in 2022 - $13 trillion to Greater China's $11.7 trillion. An economic slump, tighter regulation, and the lingering impact of Covid restrictions in mainland China hurt revenue at consumer-facing companies such as Alibaba (NYSE: ) (No. 68), Tencent (No. 147), and JD.com (No. 52).

Fortune Global 500 companies generated revenues totaling $41 trillion -- more than one-third of the world's GDP -- for an increase of 8 per cent over last year.

Cumulative profits were down 7 per cent from last year at $2.9 trillion. Companies on the 2022 list employ 70.1 million people worldwide and are based in 232 cities and 33 countries/territories and regions around the world.

The number of women CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies rose to 29 this year, from 24 last year.

Gotta wait for more than 3.7 hours for 45 minutes travel @peakbengaluru #rapido #Bengaluru #peakbengaluru,"" the user tweeted.

The user's pick-up location was Koramangala -- the IT hub of the city.

Looking at this post, a user sarcastically commented: ""This is the way #bangalorian.""

Like many other cities, Bengaluru is also known for its chaotic traffic that creates problems on its busy roads.

Commuters have long complained about the never-ending gridlocks and cancellations caused by ride-hailing apps during peak hours.

Surge pricing is common, but traffic is heavy, and even getting a ride can be difficult.

Last month, a man who took a Rapido bike for travel said that his Apple (NASDAQ: ) watch thought he was cycling as he was stuck in a Bengaluru jam.

The traffic in the city gets so severe sometimes that vehicles don’t even move an inch.

In May, a video of a bus driver eating his entire lunch while stuck in traffic went viral, garnering millions of views.

Meanwhile, a Rapido driver, who misbehaved with a woman passenger during the ride and even afterwards harassed over the phone, has been arrested.

Bengaluru Deputy Commissioner of Police, South-East division, C.K. Baba, in a tweet said that they have arrested a ""real sicko on wheels"".

The woman, Athira Purushothaman had taken to Twitter on July 21 stating that she had gone for the Manipur violence protest at Town Hall and booked a Rapido auto to go home from the venue.

However, after several cancellations, she decided to take a Rapido bike back home.

When they reached an isolated area - with no other vehicles around, the driver began masturbating.

His father and iconic Apple figure Steve died from complications of pancreatic cancer in 2011.

“My father got diagnosed with cancer when I was 12,” Reed was quoted as saying.

He was at Stanford University then, studying as an undergraduate student to become a doctor.

Shaken by his father’s death, he took a break from oncology and switched to majoring in history.

However, he returned to the field after completing his master’s degree and led Emerson’s health care division.

Reed has now created Yosemite VC firm, “whose name alludes to the national park where his parents were married”.

The firm has raised $200 million from investors and institutions including the venture capitalist John Doerr, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Rockefeller University and MIT.

“My dad succumbed to cancer when I was in college at Stanford. I was pre-med because I really wanted to be a doctor and cure people myself. But just completely candidly, it was really difficult after he passed away,” Reed was quoted as saying.

“I had never ever wanted to be a venture capitalist. But I realised that when you’re actually incubating something and putting it together, you can make a tremendous difference in what assets are part of that, what direction it’s going to take, and what the scientific focus is going to be,” he added.

According to DealBook, Yosemite will run a for-profit business but also maintain a donor-advised fund. The idea is to help seed innovation.

2022-08-01, IANS,August has been the worst performing month for US stocks since 1986,https://in.investing.com/news/august-has-been-the-worst-performing-month-for-us-stocks-since-1986-3749949,"New York, August 1 (IANS) US markets just wrapped up a winning July, with the and both notching their fifth positive month in a row, CNN reported.But August is here, and that often means trouble for markets. The last time the S&P 500 was on a winning streak this long was in 2021, when it was positive for seven months in a row — until August hit and ended the victory run.

The well-known Wall Street adage says “sell in May and go away”, because the summer, and August in particular, marks a historically volatile period for the stock market. That’s largely because so many investors take vacations and there are decreased trading volumes. This reduced activity can lead to increased volatility.

On average, August has been the worst performing month for stocks since 1986, according to Morningstar, CNN reported.

And this August may be choppier than usual because it’s particularly busy for late summer. It’s chock full of economic data, a key conference and big corporate reports. That means the dwindling number of traders who remain must take extra care in a such a potentially volatile environment.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) both report this week, and all eyes will be on these tech titans for clues about the mood among US consumers.

“This week’s Apple earnings report is critical for markets, as Apple is not only the market’s most valuable company, it’s also a litmus test for consumer spending, which so far has been keeping the economy afloat. But we have been seeing some signs of a consumer slowdown,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management on Monday.

With a valuation of $3 trillion, Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company, and its report could easily swing the direction of the markets, CNN reported.

By promoting greater interoperability of 3D tools and data, the alliance will enable developers and content creators to describe, compose, and simulate large-scale 3D projects and build an ever-widening range of 3D-enabled products and services.

“OpenUSD will help accelerate the next generation of AR experiences, from artistic creation to content delivery, and produce an ever-widening array of spatial computing applications,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group.

“Apple has been an active contributor to the development of USD, and it is an essential technology for the groundbreaking visionOS platform, as well as the new Reality Composer Pro developer tool. We look forward to fostering its growth into a broadly adopted standard,” he added.

The alliance will develop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD.

This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications.

The Linux Foundation’s JDF was chosen to house the project, as it will enable open, efficient, and effective development of OpenUSD specifications, while providing a path to recognition through the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).

AOUSD will also provide the primary forum for the collaborative definition of enhancements to the technology by the greater industry.

""While sell-through in June eked out slight growth, results varied wildly by region. The US remained weak in the month of June, declining 9% YoY (driven by weak upgrade rates at Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile) while China sell-through was up ~4% driven by demand during the 618 E-commerce festival,"" they explained.

""Europe sell through declined ~1%, the 19th straight monthly decline. However, given easing comps in Europe (+190bps MoM) in July, we expect unit sell-through to be flattish to modestly up in this region next month.""

The analysts concluded that demand in India remains solid, up 67% YoY, but they added that the region only accounted for 650,000 units or about 4% of total units, ""essentially flattish with the prior 5 months."""

Apple, Amazon dominate earnings slate

While sentiment remains fragile, the focus Thursday is likely to be on Apple, the largest company in the world according to market capitalization, and online retail behemoth Amazon as they are scheduled to announce their quarterly earnings, in what has already been a busy week of corporate results.

Apple is likely to report a third straight quarter of declining revenue, with details about its current quarter, which ends in September, likely to be in focus. Investors may also be interested if the iPhone maker has any plans to integrate artificial intelligence into its operations.

At Amazon, the group's key cloud computing division will be in the spotlight, with the retail giant having previously flagged that a deceleration in growth in the prior quarter at the unit, Amazon Web Services, continued into April.

Other results are due from the likes of brewing giant Anheuser Busch Inbev (EBR: ), housing letting company Airbnb (NASDAQ: ), online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ: ), mobile payments company Block (NYSE: )and insurer Cigna (NYSE: ).

Elsewhere, chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) stock slumped over 8% with a current-quarter revenue forecast that was below market estimates, while DoorDash (NYSE: ) stock rose more 5% after the delivery firm raised its annual core profit forecast for a second time and posted an upbeat quarterly as groceries and food orders jumped.

Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) shares fell more than 8% in pre-market Thursday trade following the report.

The chipmaker adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

“We are pleased with our technology leadership, product roadmap and design-win execution, which position us well for growth and diversification in the long term,” said Cristiano Amon, President and CEO of Qualcomm Incorporated.

“As AI use cases proliferate to the edge, on-device AI has the potential to drive an inflection point across all our products. Qualcomm remains best positioned to lead this transition given the unmatched accelerated computing performance with the power efficiency of our platforms.”

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2.00 on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of $1.94 on revenue of $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank analysts downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share.

""QCOM delivered and in-line qtr and guide vs. our estimates, but management’s soft commentary around its Dec qtr and incremental headwinds in 2024 lead us to reduce our CY24 EPS ests by -8% and downgrade the stock,"" the analysts said in a note.

""With QCOM shares trading at its 5yr avg multiple (14x) on our reduced ests that already assume some cyclical rebound and better than the worst case customer scenarios, we see the shares as fairly valued and likely to remain in a $120 +/- trading range until these cyclical and structural uncertainties are resolved.""

CFRA analysts lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock.

""Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24,"" they wrote.

Bank of England set to hike once more

Risk appetite remained weak in Europe Thursday, following on from the previous session's sharp losses in the wake of the decision of rating agency Fitch to downgrade the United States’ credit rating,

Worries about the debt piles that governments around the world have accumulated remain, but attention Thursday is turning towards the as it holds its latest policy-setting meeting later in the session.

This central bank is expected to hike once more by 25 basis points to 5.25%, and not the 50 bps of last month, after fell to 7.9% in June, easing off 8.7% in May.

This is still substantially above the BOE’s 2% medium-term target, and investors will be keen to study the bank’s growth and inflation forecasts for indications of just how sticky inflation has become, and thus how long this tightening cycle will last.

German trade data disappoints

There is also an abundance of economic data due for release later Thursday, and the market received some good news after China started the day by releasing better-than-expected activity, a boost after Monday’s weak numbers.

""Trade is no longer the strong resilient growth driver of the German economy that it used to be, but rather a drag,"" said Carsten Brzeski, global head of macroeconomics at ING.

There is also services PMI data due throughout , and is expected to confirm an expanding sector, as the services sector attempts to make up for manufacturing weakness, while the release for June should confirm inflation is on the retreat.

Apple dominates the earnings slate

Apple (NASDAQ: ), the world’s largest company by market capitalization, is set to announce earnings later in the session, and investors will be listening for any details on new product launches as well as any signs it will enter the much-hyped AI world.

Back in Europe, BMW (ETR: ) stock fell 1.9% after the auto giant warned that supply chain issues remained, even as it lifted its full-year guidance.

Adidas AG (ETR: ) stock fell 0.7% after the German sportswear manufacturer's sales fell 5% in the second quarter but a release of Yeezy shoes helped its profit margin increase, narrowing a projected loss.

Societe Generale SA (EPA: ) stock rose 1.7% after France's third-biggest listed bank reported better-than-expected earnings, as cost management and a strong growth of its car leasing division alleviated a steep fall in margins at its retail branch.

Rolls-Royce (LON: ) stock fell 2.6% despite the aero-engineer reporting a jump in first-half profit, led by a large improvement in its civil aerospace margin, while Infineon (ETR: ) stock slumped 11% after the German chipmaker's margin outlook raised concerns about the chipmaker’s profitability.

Crude retreats despite record U.S. inventories draw

Oil prices fell Thursday on worries about the global economic outlook, even after a record drop in U.S. inventories indicated a substantial tightening in crude markets.

""I believe that spatial computing is a new ecosystem that Apple wants to build, using Vision Pro as the core to integrate other devices, including AirTag 2.""

In June, Kuo had said that AirTag has gradually grown in shipments since its release.

""Shipment estimations of AirTag reach about 20 mn & 35 mn units in 2021 & 2022, respectively. If AirTag shipments continue to grow, I believe Apple will develop the 2nd generation.""

Apple introduced AirTag in April 2021.

According to the iPhone maker, AirTag is a small and elegantly designed accessory that helps customers keep track of and find the items that matter most with Apple’s Find My app.

Current AirTag features precision-etched polished stainless steel, and is water and dust resistant.

It also comes with a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate AirTag, and a removable cover that makes it easy for users to replace the battery.

AirTag's use proved invaluable in reuniting many users with their lost or stolen items.

Last month, an AirTag had helped to track down a restaurant burglar who stole $15,000 worth of goods.

In June, the tracker had helped to bust robbers who stole more than $62,000 in thefts.

In January this year, an AirTag had helped to rescue one-year-old Australian shepherd who got away from his owner while out for a walk and fell into a fast-flowing storm drain, by leading rescuers to his location.

""While we had previously said that X would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10 per cent, we are amending that policy to X keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10 per cent. First 12 months is still free for all.""

""Apple does take 30 per cent, but I will speak with @tim_cook and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30 per cent of what X keeps in order to maximise what creators receive,"" he added.

When a user said, ""It’s true. I think it would be helpful to be able to change the price on paid subscriptions. Is that going to be rolled out soon?"" Musk replied: ""Yeah, that’s coming soon.""

Fitch had earlier this week downgraded its rating for the U.S. government to AA+ from AAA, citing concerns over fiscal spending and increased clashes between the Democrats and Republicans.

While analysts downplayed the direct impact of the downgrade, the move still triggered a wave of selling across global stock markets, as investors locked in profits after a strong run through June and July.

Technology stocks see extended profit taking, strong payrolls data weighs

Tech stocks, which had seen strong gains over the past two months, bore the brunt of selling pressure, with South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s index falling 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.

Stocks were also rattled by stronger-than-expected U.S. data on Wednesday, which boosted the dollar and Treasury yields as markets positioned for a similar reading from official data due on Friday.

Resilience in the U.S. economy - particularly in the labor market - gives the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep raising interest rates, which bodes poorly for risk-driven stock markets.

Tech stockholders were also on edge ahead of earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Broader Asian markets retreated. Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the index sliding 1.6%, while the broader fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan’s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.

Australia’s fell 0.5% as data showed that the country’s remained steady in June. Australian also fell less than expected in the second quarter.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a slightly positive open, after the index plummeted from record highs this week. High weightage of technology stocks weighed heavily on the Nifty and the in recent sessions.

Chinese stocks limit losses as PMI data signals some strength

China’s and indexes fell less than their peers on Thursday, as a showed that the country’s services sector grew more than expected in July.

The reading indicated that steady retail spending and services demand was still keeping some facets of Chinese business activity afloat, and could help support a bigger economic recovery this year, especially if the government rolls out more stimulus measures.

But investors appear to have somewhat soured on the prospect of more Chinese stimulus, given that officials have offered up few details on how the measures will be carried out. The country's biggest economic engines - manufacturing and real estate - are also struggling despite promises of more support."

Tech stocks have been rallying all year on the prospect of easing conditions for interest rates. Fitch downgraded the U.S. on Tuesday night, citing increased polarity in Washington over debt ceiling and other negotiations that point to a deterioration in governance standards. The Treasury Department pushed back at the firm's assertions.

Still, it was enough to weigh on markets amid a deluge of corporate earnings reports this week.

After raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July, the Fed could be at or near the end of its rate hiking plans. It doesn't meet again about interest rates until September, and futures traders are not unanimous on when or whether another rate hike could come. Some see rates rising another quarter of a percentage point in September, some see it in November.

Walmart joins a spike in the number of US companies on the Global 500 this year, reaching its highest total since 2010 at 136 companies, which is also the highest for a stand-alone country.

Big Tech, meanwhile, proved it also remains a robust and profitable sector. Together, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) brought in $233 billion in net income, with Apple (No. 8) earning just short of $100 billion in profits, the most ever by a US company.

There were 39 newcomers to this year's Fortune Global 500, including 23 companies making their debut, such as Warner Bros. Discovery (No. 449), plus first time Chinese companies, Contemporary Amperex Technology (No. 292) and Meituan (No. 467).

By geography, Chinese companies in total – Greater China: mainland China including Hong Kong, and adding Taiwan – top this year's Global 500 with 142 companies.

But the 136 US companies generated more revenue in 2022 - $13 trillion to Greater China's $11.7 trillion. An economic slump, tighter regulation, and the lingering impact of Covid restrictions in mainland China hurt revenue at consumer-facing companies such as Alibaba (NYSE: ) (No. 68), Tencent (No. 147), and JD.com (No. 52).

Fortune Global 500 companies generated revenues totaling $41 trillion -- more than one-third of the world's GDP -- for an increase of 8 per cent over last year.

Cumulative profits were down 7 per cent from last year at $2.9 trillion. Companies on the 2022 list employ 70.1 million people worldwide and are based in 232 cities and 33 countries/territories and regions around the world.

The number of women CEOs of Fortune Global 500 companies rose to 29 this year, from 24 last year.

2022-08-02, IANS,Rapido shows user 3.5-hr wait for 45-min ride in B'luru,https://in.investing.com/news/rapido-shows-user-35hr-wait-for-45min-ride-in-bluru-3751988,"New Delhi, Aug 2 (IANS) A resident from Bengaluru has posted a screenshot from the ride-hailing app Rapido on Twitter (now X), showing a mind-boggling waiting time of 225 minutes for an auto-rickshaw ride of just 45 minutes.""Rapido wait time getting out of hand. Gotta wait for more than 3.7 hours for 45 minutes travel @peakbengaluru #rapido #Bengaluru #peakbengaluru,"" the user tweeted.

The user's pick-up location was Koramangala -- the IT hub of the city.

Looking at this post, a user sarcastically commented: ""This is the way #bangalorian.""

Like many other cities, Bengaluru is also known for its chaotic traffic that creates problems on its busy roads.

Commuters have long complained about the never-ending gridlocks and cancellations caused by ride-hailing apps during peak hours.

Surge pricing is common, but traffic is heavy, and even getting a ride can be difficult.

Last month, a man who took a Rapido bike for travel said that his Apple (NASDAQ: ) watch thought he was cycling as he was stuck in a Bengaluru jam.

The traffic in the city gets so severe sometimes that vehicles don’t even move an inch.

In May, a video of a bus driver eating his entire lunch while stuck in traffic went viral, garnering millions of views.

Meanwhile, a Rapido driver, who misbehaved with a woman passenger during the ride and even afterwards harassed over the phone, has been arrested.

Bengaluru Deputy Commissioner of Police, South-East division, C.K. Baba, in a tweet said that they have arrested a ""real sicko on wheels"".

The woman, Athira Purushothaman had taken to Twitter on July 21 stating that she had gone for the Manipur violence protest at Town Hall and booked a Rapido auto to go home from the venue.

However, after several cancellations, she decided to take a Rapido bike back home.

When they reached an isolated area - with no other vehicles around, the driver began masturbating.

It's the busiest week of earnings, with reports due out later from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) among big tech names. Pharmaceutical giants Merck (NS: ) & Company Inc (NYSE: )and Pfizer (NYSE: ) reported mixed results on Tuesday.

But investors are keenly focused on Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 200,000 jobs, slightly cooling from the prior month, while unemployment is expected to remain at record-lows near 3.6%. The Federal Reserve is looking for signs that the tight labor market has shown some softening without sparking big job losses as it tries to balance its fight against inflation with its efforts to guide the economy to a soft landing.

The Fed doesn't meet to decide on interest rates again until September. Futures traders see the probability of the Fed remaining at current rate levels when it does meet then, while some see a 30% probability of it raising rates another quarter of a point in November.

The idea that the Fed could be at the end of its rate hikes is lifting tech stocks, pulling the higher by 37% so far this year.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Qualcomm earnings

Chip maker Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.81 on revenue of $8.5 billion.

2. Shopify reports

His father and iconic Apple figure Steve died from complications of pancreatic cancer in 2011.

“My father got diagnosed with cancer when I was 12,” Reed was quoted as saying.

He was at Stanford University then, studying as an undergraduate student to become a doctor.

Shaken by his father’s death, he took a break from oncology and switched to majoring in history.

However, he returned to the field after completing his master’s degree and led Emerson’s health care division.

Reed has now created Yosemite VC firm, “whose name alludes to the national park where his parents were married”.

The firm has raised $200 million from investors and institutions including the venture capitalist John Doerr, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Rockefeller University and MIT.

“My dad succumbed to cancer when I was in college at Stanford. I was pre-med because I really wanted to be a doctor and cure people myself. But just completely candidly, it was really difficult after he passed away,” Reed was quoted as saying.

“I had never ever wanted to be a venture capitalist. But I realised that when you’re actually incubating something and putting it together, you can make a tremendous difference in what assets are part of that, what direction it’s going to take, and what the scientific focus is going to be,” he added.

According to DealBook, Yosemite will run a for-profit business but also maintain a donor-advised fund. The idea is to help seed innovation.

Reed has three siblings, sisters Lisa Brennan-Jobs, Eve Jobs and Erin Siena Jobs.

2022-08-01, IANS,August has been the worst performing month for US stocks since 1986,https://in.investing.com/news/august-has-been-the-worst-performing-month-for-us-stocks-since-1986-3749949,"New York, August 1 (IANS) US markets just wrapped up a winning July, with the and both notching their fifth positive month in a row, CNN reported.But August is here, and that often means trouble for markets. The last time the S&P 500 was on a winning streak this long was in 2021, when it was positive for seven months in a row — until August hit and ended the victory run.

The well-known Wall Street adage says “sell in May and go away”, because the summer, and August in particular, marks a historically volatile period for the stock market. That’s largely because so many investors take vacations and there are decreased trading volumes. This reduced activity can lead to increased volatility.

On average, August has been the worst performing month for stocks since 1986, according to Morningstar, CNN reported.

And this August may be choppier than usual because it’s particularly busy for late summer. It’s chock full of economic data, a key conference and big corporate reports. That means the dwindling number of traders who remain must take extra care in a such a potentially volatile environment.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) both report this week, and all eyes will be on these tech titans for clues about the mood among US consumers.

“This week’s Apple earnings report is critical for markets, as Apple is not only the market’s most valuable company, it’s also a litmus test for consumer spending, which so far has been keeping the economy afloat. But we have been seeing some signs of a consumer slowdown,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management on Monday.

With a valuation of $3 trillion, Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company, and its report could easily swing the direction of the markets, CNN reported.

By promoting greater interoperability of 3D tools and data, the alliance will enable developers and content creators to describe, compose, and simulate large-scale 3D projects and build an ever-widening range of 3D-enabled products and services.

“OpenUSD will help accelerate the next generation of AR experiences, from artistic creation to content delivery, and produce an ever-widening array of spatial computing applications,” said Mike Rockwell, Apple’s vice president of the Vision Products Group.

“Apple has been an active contributor to the development of USD, and it is an essential technology for the groundbreaking visionOS platform, as well as the new Reality Composer Pro developer tool. We look forward to fostering its growth into a broadly adopted standard,” he added.

The alliance will develop written specifications detailing the features of OpenUSD.

This will enable greater compatibility and wider adoption, integration, and implementation, and allows inclusion by other standards bodies into their specifications.

The Linux Foundation’s JDF was chosen to house the project, as it will enable open, efficient, and effective development of OpenUSD specifications, while providing a path to recognition through the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).

AOUSD will also provide the primary forum for the collaborative definition of enhancements to the technology by the greater industry.

“We open-sourced the project in 2016, and the influence of OpenUSD now expands beyond film, visual effects, and animation and into other industries that increasingly rely on 3D data for media interchange,” informed Steve May, Chief Technology Officer at Pixar and Chairperson of AOUSD.

Guido Quaroni, Senior Director of Engineering, 3D&I at Adobe said that leveraging a common 3D data representation during the creative process multiplies the value brought by each package and device.

“OpenUSD was created to be one of these ‘multipliers’ and we are excited to see a diverse group of companies joining together to support this innovative and open technology,” Quaroni added.

The analysts, who have a Neutral rating and $195 price target on AAPL shares, explained that iPhone sell-through in the month of June came in at 15.4 million units, up 2% YoY against a 9% decline in June 2022, resulting in a 1% decline in the quarter. In the US, sell-through was down 14%.

""While sell-through in June eked out slight growth, results varied wildly by region. The US remained weak in the month of June, declining 9% YoY (driven by weak upgrade rates at Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile) while China sell-through was up ~4% driven by demand during the 618 E-commerce festival,"" they explained.

""Europe sell through declined ~1%, the 19th straight monthly decline. However, given easing comps in Europe (+190bps MoM) in July, we expect unit sell-through to be flattish to modestly up in this region next month.""

The analysts concluded that demand in India remains solid, up 67% YoY, but they added that the region only accounted for 650,000 units or about 4% of total units, ""essentially flattish with the prior 5 months."""

While they continue to see moderate headwinds in its hardware business due to the macro environment, the analysts raised the price target on the stock to $220 (from $195) while keeping its bullish Outperform rating.

""We believe AAPL continues to see moderate headwinds in its hardware business due to the macro with iPhone demand stable overall while iPad, Mac, AirPods, and Watch products could see muted C2H seasonality based on our latest build forecasts,"" the analysts commented.

Meanwhile, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms is reportedly gearing up to launch a new artificial intelligence chatbot that can take on the personas of different characters. Elsewhere, a bright pulsating sign on the roof of the headquarters of Elon Musk's newly-renamed social media group X is taken down after sparking controversy with local residents.

1. Futures inch lower

U.S. stock futures edged under the flatline on Tuesday as a new month of trading begins with a stream of corporate earnings set to be released.

By 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT), the contract slipped by 97 points or 0.27%, lost 12 points or 0.25%, and dipped by 48 points or 0.30%.

The main indices closed out July in the green, with the benchmark jumping by 3.1% during the month after the close of dealmaking on Monday. It was the index's fifth straight month of gains - the longest such streak since 2021. The also climbed by more than 3% in July, while the tech-heavy added around 4.1%.

Emerging signs of cooling inflation, resilient economic activity, and expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from an aggressive campaign of hikes have combined to help underpin a wide-spread rally in stocks. The second-quarter earnings season, meanwhile, has featured stronger-than-expected results from a host of major companies.

2. Busy earnings week kicks into gear

A rush of corporate returns is due out on Tuesday, accelerating the pace of a busy week that will see more than 160 S&P constituent firms report their latest quarterly earnings.

Headlining Tuesday's releases before the start of U.S. trading are pharmaceutical companies Merck (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ), as well as construction equipment giant - and economic bellwether - Caterpillar (NYSE: ). Chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ: ) and coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) will also unveil results after the bell.

Later in the week, tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are scheduled to deliver their latest earnings.

More than half of the companies in the have already reported. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, four-fifths of these businesses have posted earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.

3. Meta preparing to launch AI chatbots - FT

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is preparing to release new artificial intelligence-powered chatbots that have different personalities, according to a report in the Financial Times, as the Facebook parent attempts to boost user engagement.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said Meta is working on prototypes that can carry on humanlike conversations. Some versions of the AI, known internally as ""personas,"" can take on various characters, the FT added. Sources also told the paper that Meta is exploring one chatbot that speaks like Abraham Lincoln or another that gives travel advice in the style of a surfer.

The chatbots, which the FT said could be launched as soon as September, are being designed to create a new search function and offer recommendations.

Meta declined to comment to the FT.

The report comes as the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant has been facing fierce competition to attract users and keep them engaged with its platforms. Like other Silicon Valley players, Meta is also in a race to develop -- and ultimately profit from -- AI technology.

4. Controversial X sign dismantled

A large glowing X on the roof of the San Francisco headquarters of X - the short-text messaging company formerly known as Twitter - has been removed following a string of complaints from neighbors.

The flashing sign had been placed on top of the firm's Market Street high-rise offices last Friday. Over the weekend, 24 complaints about the X were filed with the city's building department, Reuters reported. Locals had been taking videos showing the pulsating light, criticizing it as an intrusive presence in the area.

A spokesperson from San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection told Reuters that inspectors had observed the structure being dismantled on Monday, adding that the property owners will be fined for the ""unpermitted installation of the illuminated structure.”

X, meanwhile, claimed the sign was taken down voluntarily.

The controversy comes as X's owner Elon Musk is attempting to overhaul the social media group and turn it into a so-called ""everything app"" that includes everything from payments to ride hailing. Musk has also said he would keep X in San Francisco despite what he described as a ""doom spiral"" of businesses leaving the city.

5. Oil drifts lower

Oil prices slipped on Tuesday in a sign of potential profit-taking following a July rally that was supported by tightening global supplies and hopes for a rebound in demand in the second half of the year.

By 05:17 ET, futures traded 0.37% lower at $81.50 per barrel, while the contract dropped 0.29% to $85.18 a barrel.

Analysts cited by Reuters argued that oil prices may be correcting after being overbought in recent months. Meanwhile, sentiment was dented by a private survey that suggested further weakness in the Chinese economy, the world's biggest crude importer.

However, both U.S. crude and Brent settled at their highest levels since April on Monday, boosted in part by the prospect of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia this month. Riyadh is also reportedly expected to extend its reductions into September at a meeting this Friday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.

Meanwhile, investors are becoming more confident that the Federal Reserve may be able to bring down inflation without causing a wider collapse of the U.S. economy. According to analysts, such a scenario, which has been dubbed a ""soft landing,"" could help bolster fuel demand later this year in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer."

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: ) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK: ) (NYSE: ), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK: ), and Baidu Inc (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) kept the index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK: ) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The index logged small gains, while Japan’s rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s index rose just 0.1%, while the fell slightly as a showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing."

On Monday, CNBC saw workers dismantling the glowing X, removing its lights and an arm of the letter, after receiving complaints from nearby residents and city officials.

The sign was taken down from the roof by 1:00 p.m.

According to a spokesman, San Francisco’s Department of Building Inspections received 24 complaints.

The complaints stated that the sign was placed up without a permit, is unsafe and is a nuisance.

One claimed that residents found it difficult to sleep due to the flashing lights.

“This morning, building inspectors observed the structure being dismantled,” Patrick Hannan, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection, said in an email.

He also said that ""the property owner will be assessed fees"" for ""building permits for the installation and removal of the structure, and to cover the cost of the Department of Building Inspection and the Planning Department’s investigation.""

In a complaint, city officials claimed they were informed by Twitter that the building was a ""temporary lighted sign for an event.""

It’s possible that the sign is only being temporarily dismantled for improvements or to get city approval,"" the report said.

According to a picture captured by Getty Images’ Justin Sullivan, while the X sign was being dismantled, the vertical Twitter sign was not there on the building.

On the other hand, Twitter is now listed as X in the iOS App Store, indicating that Apple (NASDAQ: ) gave the app special treatment to permit a one-character name.

According to The Verge, the exception might be a signal that Musk and the iPhone maker desire to put the past behind them.

In November last year, Musk had accused Apple of threatening to remove the Twitter app from the store.

However, after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk later said it was a “misunderstanding.”

Along with the X rebranding, the company also updated its tagline in the App Store, from “it’s what’s happening” to “blaze your glory!”

Moreover, recent economic data shows the U.S. economy is performing stronger than expected, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve will still manage to deliver a soft landing.

While the again last week and reiterated its concern over still-elevated inflation, market participants currently do not expect further rate hikes this year.

(IXIC) gained as much as 2% last week, underpinned by gains on mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Thursday after the market close.

“The current setup is fairly similar to last quarter, where the combination of a low hurdle rate, along with the improving fundamentals, eventually led to meaningful beats. Q2 EPS projections for S&P 500 were cut significantly ahead of the reporting season, and most macro data showed a sequential improvement versus Q1,” JPMorgan analysts wrote recently.

(DJI) continues to rise, recording its 3rd consecutive weekly gain. The index also hit the highest levels seen since last February.

For this week, the (Friday) will be the highlight, along with the and .

Apple and Amazon to report

According to FactSet, 51% of S&P 500 companies reported actual results as of Friday, July 28. As many as 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise while 64% of S&P 500 companies reported a positive revenue surprise.

The blended earnings decline so far for the second quarter is 7.3%, worse than the expected decline of 7%. For Q3 2022, 27 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 18 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance, FactSet data shows.

“For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 0.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -20.8%,” analysts at FactSet wrote.

Citi analysts are increasingly bullish on the S&P 500’s earnings potential for 2024, hence they raised the 2022 year-end price target to 4600 and the mid-2024 target to 5000.

“These new targets will be perceived as chasing the year-to-date move in the S&P 500. However, they better reflect an evolving macro and fundamental backdrop,” they said.

Ahead of us is another super busy earnings week. Major reporting companies include Caterpillar (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), Uber (NYSE: ), AMD (NASDAQ: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), PayPal (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Amazon, Block (NYSE: ), as well as online travel companies like Booking (NASDAQ: ) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPM: “We were OW Value vs Growth style in 2022, through longs in Commodities and in Financials, against an UW Tech, but have reversed that view for this year, partly driven by the above call from last October that US yields have peaked. We think that the OW Growth vs Value style should stay relevant through the rest of 2022.”

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.

Jobs report is the week’s data highlight

The raised interest rates to the highest level in 22 years last week, but also changed its forecast to no longer predict a U.S. recession this year.

Additionally, expectations are growing that inflation is slowing enough for this to be the last hike of the central bank’s year-long tightening cycle, helped by Friday’s second-quarter falling to 1.0%, a drop from 1.2% in the first quarter and a peak of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022.

Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear any future decisions would be data dependent, which brings Friday's U.S. firmly into focus. This is expected to show that the economy added 200,000 jobs in July, while the remained at a historical low of 3.6% and cooled.

Positive earnings boost sentiment

The earnings season rolls on, with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings later this week.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second-quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Citigroup raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 by 15% earlier Monday as it now sees a higher probability of a soft landing for the U.S. economy, as well as an earnings upside.

Elsewhere, Walmart (NYSE: ) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the retail giant has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group.

Crude gains on U.S. economic optimism

Oil prices rose Monday as a more upbeat look at the crude market by Goldman Sachs overshadowed weak Chinese activity data.

Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs on Sunday lifted its global oil demand forecast for the year to an all-time high of 102.8 million barrels per day in July, citing a reduced recession risk and a strong effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to push up prices.

The crude market is on track for its biggest monthly gain in over a year on expectations of tightening global supply with Saudi Arabia seen as likely to extend its production cuts into September.

Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.

1. Futures edge higher

U.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.

At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, added 4 points or 0.08%, and moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.

The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The , which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy has added 3.8%.

As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.

2. Amazon and Apple results ahead

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.

Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.

For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.

Apple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.

Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.

3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar

Hiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

Economists predict that total rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.

The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""

Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.

4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) cease trading in all digital tokens except for prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.

In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.

Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.

The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.

Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.

For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.

5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.

Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.

The moves increase Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers."

He intended to spend a week riding in the Swiss Alps, then another week with a cycling group in Luxembourg, followed by a third week in Finland.

According to Sherry, it was to be his last cycling trip to Europe.

“I’m 68-- I’m getting old,” he said.

“I keep doing these epic bike trips [abroad] and with each one I think it’s probably the last I’m going to do. Those beautiful climbs in Switzerland that I love so much, those may be in my past and not my future anymore -- but I wanted one more trip to Switzerland.”

He booked a ticket with American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) -- codeshare flights on British Airways planes, from Washington D.C. to London, and then London to Zurich -- and packed up his bike for the trip and also put an AirTag inside it.

""While his suitcase arrived on the carousel, his bike -- zipped up in its carrie r-- had become one of the 7.6 out of every 1,000 items of luggage to be, as the industry coyly terms it, 'mishandled', in other words: lost,"" the report said.

At first, he was not worried.

“I’ve travelled into Zurich three times with my bike, and one time it was at the oversized luggage area, another time it didn’t come out, but I went over to the corner and there was an employee who had my bike,” he said.

“So my first thought was, It must be in the airport, I just have to find the right door. But I was looking around, didn’t see anything and opened the app.”

The 'Find My' app--, which traces Apple devices including AirTags--, showed the bike at London's Heathrow Airport.

Sherry reported it to the lost baggage desk, and even showed the app.

“I said, ‘Look, I can tell you where it is’. She looked and said ‘Oh!’ I can’t believe that it was the first time someone was using the Find My app, but she seemed surprised that I could show her where it was in real time,"" he said.

Although the staff member was unable to log the location of the bike, she noted that the majority of lost luggage is found within 24 hours.

After a few days of waiting, and constantly tweeting the location of his bicycle, an email from British Airways confirmed it was being delivered to him.

Sherry said that using AirTag was helpful as “It helped being able to see every few hours that it was last seen a few minutes ago, and I think American Airlines or maybe the Heathrow Twitter team got it moving”. I

f not, he said, “I might still be waiting-- although I’d probably have face time with real people in D.C. to recover it.""

According to him, the notch is anticipated to be removed from the standard iPhone model in favour of the Dynamic Island.

He also reported that the next Apple Watch processor, the S9, will have a ""fairly sizable performance bump,"" making it the first notable speed boost since 2020.

The tech giant told The Wall Street Journal that it is “working on solutions”.“We are aware that some users may be experiencing an issue where Screen Time settings are unexpectedly reset,” the company was quoted as saying in the report.

“We take these reports very seriously and we have been, and will continue, making updates to improve the situation,” it added.

Apple was set to fix the bud issue in May, but apparently the problem has persisted.

Apple’s Family Sharing system allows parents to put usage limits on their kids’ devices.

Family Sharing makes it easy for up to six family members to share music, films, TV programmes, apps, books, subscriptions including iCloud+ and more, all without sharing an Apple ID.

Screen Time lets parents know how much time kids spend on apps, websites, and more. This way, they can make more informed decisions about how they use devices.

“If it's your child's device, you can set up Screen Time and create settings on their device or you can use Family Sharing to configure your child’s device from your device. After you set up your child’s device, you can also use Family Sharing to see reports and adjust settings from your device,” according to the company.

With Screen Time, you can also create a dedicated passcode to secure settings, so only you can extend time or make changes.

2022-07-30, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3746062,"Investing.com -- More big tech earnings and the U.S. jobs report for July will be the main highlights in the week ahead. Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

Meanwhile, Facebook-owner Meta Platforms is reportedly gearing up to launch a new artificial intelligence chatbot that can take on the personas of different characters. Elsewhere, a bright pulsating sign on the roof of the headquarters of Elon Musk's newly-renamed social media group X is taken down after sparking controversy with local residents.

1. Futures inch lower

U.S. stock futures edged under the flatline on Tuesday as a new month of trading begins with a stream of corporate earnings set to be released.

By 05:16 ET (09:16 GMT), the contract slipped by 97 points or 0.27%, lost 12 points or 0.25%, and dipped by 48 points or 0.30%.

The main indices closed out July in the green, with the benchmark jumping by 3.1% during the month after the close of dealmaking on Monday. It was the index's fifth straight month of gains - the longest such streak since 2021. The also climbed by more than 3% in July, while the tech-heavy added around 4.1%.

Emerging signs of cooling inflation, resilient economic activity, and expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon back away from an aggressive campaign of hikes have combined to help underpin a wide-spread rally in stocks. The second-quarter earnings season, meanwhile, has featured stronger-than-expected results from a host of major companies.

2. Busy earnings week kicks into gear

A rush of corporate returns is due out on Tuesday, accelerating the pace of a busy week that will see more than 160 S&P constituent firms report their latest quarterly earnings.

Headlining Tuesday's releases before the start of U.S. trading are pharmaceutical companies Merck (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ), as well as construction equipment giant - and economic bellwether - Caterpillar (NYSE: ). Chipmaker AMD (NASDAQ: ) and coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) will also unveil results after the bell.

Later in the week, tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are scheduled to deliver their latest earnings.

More than half of the companies in the have already reported. According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, four-fifths of these businesses have posted earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.

3. Meta preparing to launch AI chatbots - FT

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is preparing to release new artificial intelligence-powered chatbots that have different personalities, according to a report in the Financial Times, as the Facebook parent attempts to boost user engagement.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the paper said Meta is working on prototypes that can carry on humanlike conversations. Some versions of the AI, known internally as ""personas,"" can take on various characters, the FT added. Sources also told the paper that Meta is exploring one chatbot that speaks like Abraham Lincoln or another that gives travel advice in the style of a surfer.

The chatbots, which the FT said could be launched as soon as September, are being designed to create a new search function and offer recommendations.

Meta declined to comment to the FT.

The report comes as the Menlo Park, California-based tech giant has been facing fierce competition to attract users and keep them engaged with its platforms. Like other Silicon Valley players, Meta is also in a race to develop -- and ultimately profit from -- AI technology.

4. Controversial X sign dismantled

A large glowing X on the roof of the San Francisco headquarters of X - the short-text messaging company formerly known as Twitter - has been removed following a string of complaints from neighbors.

The flashing sign had been placed on top of the firm's Market Street high-rise offices last Friday. Over the weekend, 24 complaints about the X were filed with the city's building department, Reuters reported. Locals had been taking videos showing the pulsating light, criticizing it as an intrusive presence in the area.

A spokesperson from San Francisco's Department of Building Inspection told Reuters that inspectors had observed the structure being dismantled on Monday, adding that the property owners will be fined for the ""unpermitted installation of the illuminated structure.”

X, meanwhile, claimed the sign was taken down voluntarily.

The controversy comes as X's owner Elon Musk is attempting to overhaul the social media group and turn it into a so-called ""everything app"" that includes everything from payments to ride hailing. Musk has also said he would keep X in San Francisco despite what he described as a ""doom spiral"" of businesses leaving the city.

5. Oil drifts lower

Oil prices slipped on Tuesday in a sign of potential profit-taking following a July rally that was supported by tightening global supplies and hopes for a rebound in demand in the second half of the year.

By 05:17 ET, futures traded 0.37% lower at $81.50 per barrel, while the contract dropped 0.29% to $85.18 a barrel.

Analysts cited by Reuters argued that oil prices may be correcting after being overbought in recent months. Meanwhile, sentiment was dented by a private survey that suggested further weakness in the Chinese economy, the world's biggest crude importer.

However, both U.S. crude and Brent settled at their highest levels since April on Monday, boosted in part by the prospect of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia this month. Riyadh is also reportedly expected to extend its reductions into September at a meeting this Friday of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies.

Meanwhile, investors are becoming more confident that the Federal Reserve may be able to bring down inflation without causing a wider collapse of the U.S. economy. According to analysts, such a scenario, which has been dubbed a ""soft landing,"" could help bolster fuel demand later this year in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer."

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: ) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK: ) (NYSE: ), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK: ), and Baidu Inc (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) kept the index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK: ) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The index logged small gains, while Japan’s rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s index rose just 0.1%, while the fell slightly as a showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

The reading spurred more expectations of stimulus measures from the country, with officials promising more policies to boost domestic consumption and activity. But they have so far offered no clear specifics on the policies, which has left investors somewhat wary of local stocks.

While the prospect of more Chinese stimulus had spurred strong gains in local stocks over the past week, the momentum now appears to be slowing."

On Monday, CNBC saw workers dismantling the glowing X, removing its lights and an arm of the letter, after receiving complaints from nearby residents and city officials.

The sign was taken down from the roof by 1:00 p.m.

According to a spokesman, San Francisco’s Department of Building Inspections received 24 complaints.

The complaints stated that the sign was placed up without a permit, is unsafe and is a nuisance.

One claimed that residents found it difficult to sleep due to the flashing lights.

“This morning, building inspectors observed the structure being dismantled,” Patrick Hannan, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection, said in an email.

He also said that ""the property owner will be assessed fees"" for ""building permits for the installation and removal of the structure, and to cover the cost of the Department of Building Inspection and the Planning Department’s investigation.""

In a complaint, city officials claimed they were informed by Twitter that the building was a ""temporary lighted sign for an event.""

It’s possible that the sign is only being temporarily dismantled for improvements or to get city approval,"" the report said.

According to a picture captured by Getty Images’ Justin Sullivan, while the X sign was being dismantled, the vertical Twitter sign was not there on the building.

On the other hand, Twitter is now listed as X in the iOS App Store, indicating that Apple (NASDAQ: ) gave the app special treatment to permit a one-character name.

According to The Verge, the exception might be a signal that Musk and the iPhone maker desire to put the past behind them.

In November last year, Musk had accused Apple of threatening to remove the Twitter app from the store.

However, after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Musk later said it was a “misunderstanding.”

Along with the X rebranding, the company also updated its tagline in the App Store, from “it’s what’s happening” to “blaze your glory!”

Moreover, recent economic data shows the U.S. economy is performing stronger than expected, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve will still manage to deliver a soft landing.

While the again last week and reiterated its concern over still-elevated inflation, market participants currently do not expect further rate hikes this year.

(IXIC) gained as much as 2% last week, underpinned by gains on mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Thursday after the market close.

“The current setup is fairly similar to last quarter, where the combination of a low hurdle rate, along with the improving fundamentals, eventually led to meaningful beats. Q2 EPS projections for S&P 500 were cut significantly ahead of the reporting season, and most macro data showed a sequential improvement versus Q1,” JPMorgan analysts wrote recently.

(DJI) continues to rise, recording its 3rd consecutive weekly gain. The index also hit the highest levels seen since last February.

For this week, the (Friday) will be the highlight, along with the and .

Apple and Amazon to report

According to FactSet, 51% of S&P 500 companies reported actual results as of Friday, July 28. As many as 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise while 64% of S&P 500 companies reported a positive revenue surprise.

The blended earnings decline so far for the second quarter is 7.3%, worse than the expected decline of 7%. For Q3 2022, 27 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 18 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance, FactSet data shows.

“For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 0.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -20.8%,” analysts at FactSet wrote.

Citi analysts are increasingly bullish on the S&P 500’s earnings potential for 2024, hence they raised the 2022 year-end price target to 4600 and the mid-2024 target to 5000.

“These new targets will be perceived as chasing the year-to-date move in the S&P 500. However, they better reflect an evolving macro and fundamental backdrop,” they said.

Ahead of us is another super busy earnings week. Major reporting companies include Caterpillar (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), Uber (NYSE: ), AMD (NASDAQ: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), PayPal (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Amazon, Block (NYSE: ), as well as online travel companies like Booking (NASDAQ: ) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPM: “We were OW Value vs Growth style in 2022, through longs in Commodities and in Financials, against an UW Tech, but have reversed that view for this year, partly driven by the above call from last October that US yields have peaked. We think that the OW Growth vs Value style should stay relevant through the rest of 2022.”

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.

Jobs report is the week’s data highlight

The raised interest rates to the highest level in 22 years last week, but also changed its forecast to no longer predict a U.S. recession this year.

Additionally, expectations are growing that inflation is slowing enough for this to be the last hike of the central bank’s year-long tightening cycle, helped by Friday’s second-quarter falling to 1.0%, a drop from 1.2% in the first quarter and a peak of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022.

Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear any future decisions would be data dependent, which brings Friday's U.S. firmly into focus. This is expected to show that the economy added 200,000 jobs in July, while the remained at a historical low of 3.6% and cooled.

Positive earnings boost sentiment

The earnings season rolls on, with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings later this week.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second-quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Citigroup raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 by 15% earlier Monday as it now sees a higher probability of a soft landing for the U.S. economy, as well as an earnings upside.

Crude gains on U.S. economic optimism

Oil prices rose Monday as a more upbeat look at the crude market by Goldman Sachs overshadowed weak Chinese activity data.

Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs on Sunday lifted its global oil demand forecast for the year to an all-time high of 102.8 million barrels per day in July, citing a reduced recession risk and a strong effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to push up prices.

The crude market is on track for its biggest monthly gain in over a year on expectations of tightening global supply with Saudi Arabia seen as likely to extend its production cuts into September.

Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.

1. Futures edge higher

U.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.

At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, added 4 points or 0.08%, and moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.

The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The , which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy has added 3.8%.

As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.

2. Amazon and Apple results ahead

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.

Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.

For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.

Apple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.

Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.

3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar

Hiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

Economists predict that total rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.

The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""

Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.

4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) cease trading in all digital tokens except for prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.

In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.

Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.

The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.

Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.

For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.

5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.

Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.

The moves increase Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers."

He intended to spend a week riding in the Swiss Alps, then another week with a cycling group in Luxembourg, followed by a third week in Finland.

According to Sherry, it was to be his last cycling trip to Europe.

“I’m 68-- I’m getting old,” he said.

“I keep doing these epic bike trips [abroad] and with each one I think it’s probably the last I’m going to do. Those beautiful climbs in Switzerland that I love so much, those may be in my past and not my future anymore -- but I wanted one more trip to Switzerland.”

He booked a ticket with American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) -- codeshare flights on British Airways planes, from Washington D.C. to London, and then London to Zurich -- and packed up his bike for the trip and also put an AirTag inside it.

""While his suitcase arrived on the carousel, his bike -- zipped up in its carrie r-- had become one of the 7.6 out of every 1,000 items of luggage to be, as the industry coyly terms it, 'mishandled', in other words: lost,"" the report said.

At first, he was not worried.

“I’ve travelled into Zurich three times with my bike, and one time it was at the oversized luggage area, another time it didn’t come out, but I went over to the corner and there was an employee who had my bike,” he said.

“So my first thought was, It must be in the airport, I just have to find the right door. But I was looking around, didn’t see anything and opened the app.”

The 'Find My' app--, which traces Apple devices including AirTags--, showed the bike at London's Heathrow Airport.

Sherry reported it to the lost baggage desk, and even showed the app.

“I said, ‘Look, I can tell you where it is’. She looked and said ‘Oh!’ I can’t believe that it was the first time someone was using the Find My app, but she seemed surprised that I could show her where it was in real time,"" he said.

Although the staff member was unable to log the location of the bike, she noted that the majority of lost luggage is found within 24 hours.

After a few days of waiting, and constantly tweeting the location of his bicycle, an email from British Airways confirmed it was being delivered to him.

Sherry said that using AirTag was helpful as “It helped being able to see every few hours that it was last seen a few minutes ago, and I think American Airlines or maybe the Heathrow Twitter team got it moving”. I

f not, he said, “I might still be waiting-- although I’d probably have face time with real people in D.C. to recover it.""

Apple was set to fix the bud issue in May, but apparently the problem has persisted.

Apple’s Family Sharing system allows parents to put usage limits on their kids’ devices.

Family Sharing makes it easy for up to six family members to share music, films, TV programmes, apps, books, subscriptions including iCloud+ and more, all without sharing an Apple ID.

Screen Time lets parents know how much time kids spend on apps, websites, and more. This way, they can make more informed decisions about how they use devices.

“If it's your child's device, you can set up Screen Time and create settings on their device or you can use Family Sharing to configure your child’s device from your device. After you set up your child’s device, you can also use Family Sharing to see reports and adjust settings from your device,” according to the company.

2022-07-30, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3746062,"Investing.com -- More big tech earnings and the U.S. jobs report for July will be the main highlights in the week ahead. Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

It was possible for the police to track the man's movements because the safe was fitted with an Apple AirTag.

The police followed his movements to a number of nearby other thefts.

Smith has been accused of robbing four different restaurants taking cash, money bags and other valuables.

The entire amount taken is still unknown, but it is estimated to be between $15,000 and $20,000.

""Smith was taken into custody last Friday and is now in Horry County Jail,"" the report said.

His hearing is scheduled for August 1.

Earlier this month, it was reported that an AirTag had helped to track stolen possessions, resulting in the burglar's arrest and 15-month imprisonment term.

A Texas family became fed up with gravesite robbers and installed a hidden AirTag to capture them in the act.

The family didn't anticipate that their smart use of AirTag would help authorities find stolen bronze memorial vases valued at more than $62,000.

In January this year, an AirTag had helped to rescue a year-old Australian shepherd who got away from his owner while out for a walk and fell into a fast-flowing storm drain, by leading rescuers to his location.

2022-07-26, IANS,Apple considering release of foldable iPad in future: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-considering-release-of-foldable-ipad-in-future-report-3740472,"San Francisco, July 26 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly considering the release of a foldable iPad in the near future, according to insights from supply chain sources.According to the preview of an upcoming report from DigiTimes, Apple is interested in expanding its foldable technology efforts beyond smartphones and into the tablet market.

""Apple, who is rumoured to have been working on foldable smartphones for several years, reportedly is considering extending the effort to the tablet sector,"" as per the preview.

The latest claim adds fuel to prior rumours about the creation of a foldable iPad.

Notably, top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had earlier projected that the device might be released in 2024. Other industry experts, like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, had not yet received any information regarding such a product at the time, reports MacRumors.

According to Kuo, the foldable iPad would have an all-new design as well as a lightweight and sturdy carbon fibre kickstand.

A foldable iPad, like foldable smartphones from Samsung (KS: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), would have a hinge that allows the device to be opened and closed like a book, resulting in a significantly larger display than existing models when unfurled.

A foldable iPad would almost certainly be priced higher than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $1,099, according to the report.

Apple has yet to introduce any devices with foldable displays, but speculations claim that the company is investigating all options, including a foldable iPhone, iPad, and Mac, in the long run.

Meanwhile, the new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models, the first in the Apple iPad series to use OLED displays, will go into mass production in the first quarter of 2024, according to research firm Omdia.

When compared to existing models with LCD screens, the advantages of OLED technology for iPad Pro displays include enhanced brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater colour accuracy, and lower power consumption.

The Q2 earnings report could serve as positive catalysts for as many as 10 stocks, while 2 of them could fall given high expectations.

The strategists highlight “a lowered bar for Q2 earnings” given that the Q2 EPS estimates are down about 9% year-to-date and 16.5% from the 2022 peak.

“Expectations for 2Q earnings are still moving lower into the results season and are likely to set up a typical modest beat (the historical average is +5%). However, revisions ahead of the quarter have not been as steep as they have in past quarters, meaning the hurdle may not be quite as easy. The trend for the past three quarters has been a slight beat on the current quarter but then the out-quarter revises lower,” they said in a client note.

The market expectations from the Q2 earnings season are for 0% sales growth and -9% EPS decline.

“At the sector level, consensus expects the highest relative growth in 2Q from Discretionary and Comm. Services while Healthcare, Materials, and Energy are expected to see double-digit EPS declines,” they added.

Along these lines, they highlighted 12 names for which Morgan Stanley Research analysts expect a near-term catalyst that should drive a meaningful move in each stock.

The “positive list” includes tech giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), in addition to Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ), Five9 (NASDAQ: ), Flowserve (NYSE: ), Hess (NYSE: ), S&P Global (NYSE: ), Sunrun (NASDAQ: ), Wix (NASDAQ: ), and Yum! Brands (NYSE: ).

On the other hand, the upcoming Q2 earnings reports could act as a negative catalyst for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) and Warren Buffett-backed Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ).

Elaborating more on OXY, the strategists wrote:

“Our 2Q oil production estimate is below consensus, and our capex is above consensus. We expect lower cash flow in 2Q on lower realized prices Q/Q, outlay for preferred stock redemption accrued in 1Q, and investment in NET Power, reducing the capacity for share repurchases.”"

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued Meta over its use of Onavo back in December 2020.

The federal court has ordered the two subsidiaries of Meta, Facebook Israel and Onavo Inc, to each pay AUS$10 million for engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.

The subsidiaries, which were the Onavo Protect VPN app's developers and suppliers, were found to be responsible for misleading app descriptions displayed in Google (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) App Store listings.

""In Google and Apple App Store listings, Onavo Protect was promoted as a product that would keep users' data protected and safe, for example with language such as 'Use a free, fast and secure VPN to protect personal information' and 'Helps Keep You and Your Data Safe',"" the commission said.

""In fact, Onavo and Facebook Israel shared the personal activity data from users collected by the app in anonymised and aggregated form with parent company Meta (then known as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: )) for commercial benefit,"" it added.

The watchdog also discovered that between February 2016 and October 2017, Australian users installed the ""Onavo Protect"" VPN app over 270,000 times.

Facebook discontinued the service in May 2019.

""We took this case knowing that many consumers are concerned about how their data is captured, stored and used by digital platforms. We believe Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information that is not misleading,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said in a statement.

As stated in joint submissions to the Court, Onavo and Facebook Israel agreed that the App Store listings conveyed that the Onavo Protect VPN would only use users' data.

In the listings, Onavo Protect did not mention that it collected data about its Australian users' online activities for other purposes, including as a 'business intelligence tool'.

""In the case of the Onavo Protect app, we were concerned that consumers seeking to protect their privacy through a virtual private network were not clearly told that in downloading and using this app they were actually facilitating the use of their data for Meta's commercial benefit,"" Cass-Gottlieb said.

The analysts, who have an Equal Weight rating and $149 price target on the stock, added that despite the potential miss, it's not clear that it matters for the stock as ""bulls may expect a stronger Dec-Q.""

""We expect broadly in-line June Q as better services revenue (led by App Store, TAC also above) offsetting weaker hardware revenue, though iPhone channel fill and incremental better FX vs. guidance (2 points FX upside) can mute some of the downside for hardware,"" they wrote.

""More importantly, Sep-Q hardware guide could miss Street estimates due to IP15 delay and some IP15 pro model units shifting to Dec-Q.""

The analysts explained that as per the firm's Asia checks, the iPhone 15 is running three to four weeks behind owing to the Titanium alloy frame casing, camera module, and large screen production challenge. In addition, they say there is also a CMOS image sensor production issue with base models.

""Our latest checks also indicate iPhone sell-through in China decelerated to HSD declines in July, another bad data point for Sep-Q,"" they added.

""At a ~50% premium to the S&P 500, we see the stock as fairly valued at best. Along with the weaker consumer spending backdrop, we believe we are witnessing the catch-up from strong COVID performance across product categories. We see pressure to estimates and potentially PE multiple ahead."""
