Roth MKM analysts anticipate subdued internet tailwinds in the first half of 2024, citing the recovery of large/mid-cap multiples in the sector.

Internet companies benefited from triple tailwinds in 2022, including the comparison with Covid comps from 2022, favorable macroeconomic conditions in consumer discretionary spending, and industry-specific improvements to address privacy challenges.

Valuation multiples, particularly for mid- and large-cap firms, rebounded throughout 2022, reaching levels seen in early 2022. For 2024, the analysts expect a return to normalized growth, with e-commerce and online advertising showing healthy single-digit to low-teens percentage growth, while online travel may experience more restrained growth.

Quadrennial events such as the Summer Olympics and U.S. Presidential Elections could provide additional tailwinds.

Analysts raised the price target on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) shares by $15 to $180 per share. Amazon is their Mega Cap Pick for 2024, followed by Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

“AMZN is the only mega cap where we model accelerating revenues AND expanding op. Margins,” the analysts said in a note.

“AMZN should demonstrate accelerating revenues and expanding operating margins in 2024 vs. 2022 levels. We believe consensus continues to underestimate potential FCF acceleration in 2024 and 2025 driven by a combo of improving fundamentals and declining CapEx.”

Amazon stock closed at $149.97 on Friday."

2022-12-15, IANS,‘Project Kuiper’ internet satellites will operate like a mesh network: Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/project-kuiper-internet-satellites-will-operate-like-a-mesh-network-amazon-3938858,"San Francisco, Dec 15 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s ‘Project Kuiper’ internet satellite system has completed successful tests of an optical mesh network in low-Earth orbit.

After demonstrating 100 Gbps optical links between its prototype satellites, Project Kuiper will include laser links on every satellite in its constellation to form a mesh network in space, the company said in a statement.

Kuiper is planning a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit and the US Federal Communications Commission requires Amazon to deploy at least half of that figure by 2026. Since the successful launch and deployment of two prototype satellites in October, Project Kuiper has been conducting extensive testing of its end-to-end communications payload and network.

Last month, the company confirmed it had validated all priority systems and subsystems within 30 days of launch. These tests validated the final component of Project Kuiper’s advanced communications architecture, and the results ensure that optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) will be operational on our first production satellites, slated for launch in the first half of 2024, Amazon said.

“With optical inter-satellite links across our satellite constellation, Project Kuiper will effectively operate as a mesh network in space,” said Rajeev Badyal, Project Kuiper's vice president of technology.

“We’re excited to be able to support these next-generation OISL capabilities on every Kuiper satellite from day one,” he added.

The company is equipping every Project Kuiper satellite with multiple optical terminals to connect many satellites at a time, establishing high-speed laser cross-links that form a secure, resilient mesh network in space. These capabilities increase throughout and reduce latency across our constellation, and provide more flexibility to connect Kuiper customers across land, sea, air, and space, according to Amazon.

Amazon’s OISL capabilities will allow Project Kuiper to move and land data anywhere via its mesh network in space, bringing secure, resilient connectivity to a wide range of enterprise and public sector customers.

“Amazon’s optical mesh network will provide multiple paths to route data through space, creating resiliency and redundancy for customers who need to securely transport information around the world,” said Ricky Freeman, vice president of Kuiper Government Solutions.

Project Kuiper is beginning satellite manufacturing ahead of a full-scale deployment that starts in the first half of 2024, and expects to have enough satellites deployed to begin early customer pilots in the second half of 2024.

Survey insights offer a positive outlook

The 2024 Ad Buyer Survey revealed a promising scenario. Key takeaways include a positive shift in sentiment and an acceleration in total advertising spend for 2024. There's growing confidence among advertisers in navigating IDFA and privacy concerns, and advertisers are less concerned about recession. “Search & social share remain flat while Digital Video / CTV should gain share,” commented Piper Sandler.

The CIO survey indicated an improvement in enterprise IT spending, with database and infrastructure spending intentions notably rising. Amazon's AWS stands out as the only Cloud provider with an increase in spending intentions, a significant 2% rise from the first half of 2022.

The 13-year-old company is also shutting down its Pioneer Square (NYSE: ) headquarters and several other facilities in other states, according to GeekWire.

The closing of warehouses in Nevada and Ohio will result in another 547 layoffs, according to notices from both states.

The latest job cuts follow several earlier rounds of layoffs at Zulily, as well as the resignation of its CEO Terry Boyle in October.

Zulily was launched in 2010 by Mark Vadon and Darrell Cavens, former executives with online jewellery retailer Blue Nile.

In 2013, Zulily had 12.6 million active customers, and made $331 million in revenue, up nearly 700 per cent from 2010.

Zulily went public in 2013 in an IPO originally valued at $2.6 billion and but by the end of the first day, that figure almost doubled, according to media reports.

By 2014, Zulily had a market value of $7 billion on annual sales of $1 billion.

“Only Amazon and Old Navy hit the billion-dollar revenue mark in a shorter amount of time,” according to reports.

In 2015, Zulily was purchased by Liberty Interactive-QVC, later renamed Qurate, for a reported $2.4 billion.

In May this year, Qurate sold the company to Los Angeles private equity firm Regent.

Protecting customers and earning the trust of selling partners are core values at Amazon.

Retail theft is a persistent problem that plagues online and physical retailers alike.

“One form of retail theft involves systematic refund fraud, which undermines Amazon’s ability to efficiently serve customers and selling partners. Customers who shop in Amazon’s online stores should be delighted with their purchases, and if they are not, they should be able to easily return the product,” the lawsuit read.

Among other places, REKK operates a Telegram channel that has over 30,000 followers, where they brazenly advertise refund services that they fully admit are fraudulent.

“In this scheme, bad actors who want a free product (like an iPad) pay REKK a fee (such as 30 per cent of the product’s cost) to obtain a fraudulent refund,” according to the lawsuit.

REKK uses sophisticated methods to obtain the refund, including socially engineering Amazon customer service, phishing Amazon employees, manipulating Amazon’s systems through unauthorised access, and bribing Amazon insiders to grant refunds.

The scheme tricks Amazon into processing refunds for products that are never returned, instead of returning the products as promised.

“Defendants keep the product and the refund. REKK boasts that the organisation has fraudulently refunded over 100,000 orders from retailers (not just Amazon),” said Amazon.

2022-12-08, Investing.com,BofA says people want to buy more online - these stocks will benefit,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/bofa-says-people-want-to-buy-more-online--these-stocks-will-benefit-432SI-3930891,"A recent BofA survey showed that there is a high intent to buy more online in 2024, according to the firm's analysts in a note this week.

The survey supports e-commerce acceleration into 2024, and the investment bank believes names such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), and Wayfair (NYSE: ) are well-positioned to gain market share.

BofA surveyed over 1,000 US consumers across ages and incomes to monitor e-commerce trends and inflections. It revealed the higher intention to spend more online driven by convenience.

""According to our survey, 42% (up a strong 10pts vs. 32% last year) of respondents plan to increase eCommerce spending over the next 12 months, likely due to fading reopening headwinds. Per our survey, convenience is the top driver moving purchases Online while the biggest drawback to Online (inability to try the product) becoming less of a concern y/y,"" explained BofA.

""Data indicates low prices and shipping times are increasingly important for an eCommerce platform, and we think retailers with value pricing (Amazon, Walmart, Wayfair) are well positioned to gain share in 2024,"" analysts added.

Amazon is the investment bank's top choice for e-commerce, with the platform remaining ""by far, the most popular eComm site,"" said BofA, with 64% of respondents searching Amazon first when buying products.

""Per our survey, a record 78% have Prime membership (+1pt y/y despite higher y/y intention to churn), Prime users spend 2.6x vs. non-Prime, and a growing 68% of Prime members use Prime Video, which we think positions Amazon well for a Prime ad ramp in '24,"" said the firm.

Meanwhile, 27% of respondents prefer Walmart as the top grocery website, followed by Amazon at 19%.

""For SMID cap, Wayfair is our top pick given expected share gains vs. home furnishings industry and potential for higher leverage incremental revenue. Walmart continues to see traction with grocery and with Walmart+,"" concluded BofA's analysts."
2022-12-08, IANS,Amazon testing $9.99 monthly grocery subscription for Prime members,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-testing-999-monthly-grocery-subscription-for-prime-members-3930130,"San Francisco, Dec 8 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has announced that it's testing a new subscription model for unlimited grocery delivery for Prime members in three cities of the US.For an additional monthly charge of $9.99, Prime members in Denver, Sacramento and Columbus can get unlimited delivery on Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods orders over $35, reports The Verge.

Those who subscribe to this plan will also receive unlimited 30-minute pick-up on orders of any size.

""We're always experimenting with features to make shopping easier, faster, and more affordable, and we look forward to hearing how members who take advantage of this offer respond,"" Tony Hoggett, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores, was quoted as saying.

Prime members presently pay $6.95 for Fresh orders between $50 and $100, and $9.95 for items under $50.

However, Prime members were not always required to pay for Fresh delivery on orders over $35. Amazon began charging delivery costs for Fresh grocery orders under $150 in January, removing a benefit that allowed Prime members free delivery on orders over $35.

Amazon then reversed its decision in October, lowering the free grocery delivery threshold from $150 to $100.

In September, Amazon announced that it will introduce 'limited advertisements' to its Prime Video streaming service in 2024 as it aims to put more cash into creating TV shows and films.

In addition, the company said it will roll out the ""ad-free"" subscription tier for an extra $2.99 per month for Prime members in the US -- a similar move which was taken by competitors such as Disney+ and Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

2022-12-08, IANS,Over 10 mn people signed up for X in Dec: CEO Linda Yaccarino,https://in.investing.com/news/over-10-mn-people-signed-up-for-x-in-dec-ceo-linda-yaccarino-3929898,"San Francisco, Dec 8 (IANS) Elon Musk-run X CEO Linda Yaccarino has said that over 10 million people have signed up for X so far in December.""More than 10 million people have signed up for X so far this December!"" she posted on Thursday. This comes after reports speculated that X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pulled out their marketing campaigns after the tech billionaire endorsed an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory last month.

According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies like Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Last week, retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) confirmed that it is not advertising on X. In October, data found that X lost over half a billion user visits in September, and the platform dropped to seventh place on the global ranking, behind Instagram.

In September, X's traffic dropped from 6.4 billion to 5.8 billion, a loss of 10 per cent, according to new SimilarWeb data.

Of the 176 countries that visited X in September, 83 per cent saw a month-on-month decline in visits. Musk recently stunned the world when he told advertisers to ""go f*** yourself"" after some top companies pulled advertising on his platform over his endorsement of anti-Semitism.

However, he later apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" social media post to date.

2022-12-07, Investing.com,Why Amazon is the top 2024 internet pick at TD Cowen,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/why-amazon-is-the-top-2024-internet-pick-at-td-cowen-432SI-3928894,"Analysts at TD Cowen named their top large-cap internet stock for 2024 and it should be no surprise that the billing belongs to internet giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ). Analysts cited rising margins and AWS revenue accelerations.

Analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and raised their price target on Amazon to $200 from $180.

""Key drivers for AMZN shares in '24 are i) Record Op Inc Margins driven by AWS & Adv segments, with ""rest of biz"" turning profitable; and ii) Accelerating AWS rev growth, as co's lap cost optimizations,"" analysts commented.

First, the firm is forecasting 2024 operating income of $58 billion, which is 25% above consensus, yielding 9.1% operating income margins, ""as high-margin AWS and Advertising businesses continue to scale while ""rest of biz"" Op Inc turns positive after significant cost-cutting and easing inflationary & FX headwinds."" They estimate that the""rest of biz"" 2024 operating income will be around $4 billion following more than $38 billion in losses from '21-'23.

Moving forward, there's an anticipation of an upsurge in AWS revenue growth as AWS moves beyond initial cost optimizations, based on the firm's public cloud survey indicating that 75% of customers will have completed optimizations by the close of 2022. Additionally, there's a noticeable acceleration in AWS bookings heading into the fourth quarter of 2022, which sets a promising tone for the upcoming year and beyond.

Commenting on what is underappreciated or misunderstood by investors, analysts highlight that in 2024, Amazon plans to introduce ads on Prime Video in the US, offering opt-out for $3/month. Projections indicate potential $1.5BN-$3BN ad revenue (assuming 4-8 mins of ads/hour) and $800MM from opt-out subscriptions, boosting estimates by 3-6% for ad revenue and ~2% for subscription revenue. Expansion to major international markets is slated for later in '24.

On catalysts and milestones to watch, analysts noted as enterprises move beyond recent cost optimizations, AWS is poised to benefit from a shift in focus towards migrating more workloads to the Public Cloud. The integration of Generative AI tools throughout AWS products is expected to drive additional revenue, with 74% of IT buyers already earmarking budget for or seriously considering GenAI. Additionally, the introduction of ad-supported Prime Video is anticipated to boost ad revenue growth. Moreover, the Retail business aims to enhance conversion rates and unit growth by doubling delivery stations, further accelerating delivery speed."
2022-12-07, Investing.com,Amazon cuts fees on low-cost apparel to compete with Shein and Temu,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-cuts-fees-on-lowcost-apparel-to-compete-with-shein-and-temu-93CH-3928811,"SEATTLE - In a strategic move to maintain its dominance in the U.S. online retail market, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has announced a significant reduction in fees for apparel-related products priced under $20. Starting January next year, items under $15 will be subject to a mere 5% fee, while those priced between $15 and $20 will incur a 10% fee. This is a substantial drop from the former uniform fee of 17%.

Amazon's decision comes as it faces increasing competition from fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu, which has disrupted the industry with its agile business model. Shein adds up to thousands of new products daily and is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) with a valuation aimed at $90 billion, following a private-market valuation of $66 billion last week. The brand has become particularly popular among Gen Z customers by producing limited batches of clothing based on real-time customer interactions, thus keeping inventory levels low and waste to a minimum.

However, Shein's rapid growth has not been without controversy. Allegations of forced labor and environmental damage have cast a shadow over the company's operations. An attempt to mitigate these concerns with an influencer trip showcasing factory conditions backfired, attracting criticism for both the influencers involved and Shein itself. Despite this, Shein maintains that it invests in factory workers' well-being by providing educational opportunities and ensuring safe work environments. They also claim that their suppliers' wages are competitive within their regions.

The fast fashion industry faces calls for regulation, and Shein’s head of strategic communications Peter Pernot-Day has suggested initiatives such as recycling campaigns similar to those for plastics. He advocates for public-private partnerships to fund developments in sustainable textiles and chemical recycling technologies.

With its substantial lead over competitors like Walmart (NYSE: ), Amazon is positioning itself to navigate through the challenges posed by new entrants like Temu. The e-commerce giant's latest fee reductions are part of a broader strategy to support merchants and stay ahead in the highly competitive online marketplace.

In the ever-evolving landscape of global technology companies, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). stands as a colossus across various sectors, including e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. With a sprawling footprint that touches upon multiple facets of the digital and physical retail experience, Amazon's diverse portfolio has positioned it as a key player in numerous markets. Analysts have been closely monitoring Amazon's performance and strategic moves, offering a wealth of insights into the company's current state and future prospects.

Performance in Different Markets

Amazon has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in its core e-commerce operations. Despite facing stiff competition and a dynamic retail environment, the company has maintained a robust growth trajectory, underpinned by its expansive product offerings and a sophisticated fulfillment network. The company's e-commerce segment continues to benefit from market consolidation and the enduring shift towards online shopping.

In cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands as a pillar of strength for the company. AWS has been a consistent revenue driver, showcasing Amazon's deep technical expertise and innovation capacity. With the cloud market poised for a post-pandemic recovery and acceleration, AWS is expected to grow in line with the industry, bolstered by large contract values and a burgeoning demand for AI-driven cloud workloads.

Digital advertising has emerged as another high-margin business for Amazon. The company's advertising segment has seen accelerated growth, with projections indicating a continuation of this trend. The upcoming launch of video ads on Prime Video is anticipated to unlock additional revenue streams, further cementing Amazon's position in the advertising space.

Product Segments and Details

Amazon's product segmentation reflects its strategic focus on diversification and innovation. The company's e-commerce platform remains its most visible segment, offering an extensive array of products that cater to a wide range of consumer needs. Amazon's physical store presence, including formats like Amazon Go, Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Style stores, provides a tangible extension of its retail prowess.

AWS, as a standalone product segment, has been instrumental in establishing Amazon's dominance in the cloud services market. AWS's comprehensive suite of services, including computing power, storage solutions, and AI capabilities, has attracted a diverse customer base, ranging from startups to large enterprises.

The digital streaming and AI segments are increasingly becoming focal points for Amazon. Initiatives such as Prime Video and the development of Alexa's conversational abilities highlight the company's commitment to integrating AI into its services and improving the user experience.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

The competitive landscape for Amazon is multifaceted, with the company facing challenges across its various operations. In e-commerce, Amazon continues to fend off competition from traditional retailers and digital upstarts alike. The rise of Chinese retail platforms like Shein and Temu has introduced new competitive dynamics, although Amazon's robust supply chain and delivery advantages have helped it maintain its market leadership.

In cloud computing, AWS competes directly with other tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). While AWS has been a leader in scale and innovation, it operates in a market where competitors are also heavily investing in their cloud offerings, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning.

The digital advertising space sees Amazon going head-to-head with established players like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: ). However, Amazon's unique position as an e-commerce platform provides it with valuable consumer data that enhances its advertising capabilities.

Regulatory Environments

Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent theme for Amazon. The company has faced investigations and legal challenges in various jurisdictions over its business practices. These include antitrust concerns related to its marketplace operations and potential anti-competitive behavior. While Amazon has navigated these issues with a degree of success, the regulatory environment continues to pose risks that could impact the company's strategic flexibility and operational efficiency.

Customer Base and Management

Amazon boasts a vast and diverse customer base, with over 300 million active customers as of March 2022. This customer base is a testament to the company's ability to attract and retain shoppers through competitive pricing, a broad selection of products, and a focus on convenience.

The company's management team has been pivotal in steering Amazon through various market cycles and challenges. Their strategic decisions, from expanding into new markets like healthcare to optimizing the company's vast fulfillment network, have played a crucial role in Amazon's sustained growth.

Strategy and External Factors

Amazon's strategy revolves around continuous innovation, customer-centricity, and expansion into new markets. The company's investments in AI and machine learning are indicative of its long-term vision to remain at the forefront of technological advancements. Additionally, Amazon's approach to physical retail, through acquisitions and the launch of new store formats, reflects its understanding of the evolving retail landscape.

External factors such as macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending patterns, and technological shifts have a significant impact on Amazon's operations. The company has shown an ability to adapt to these factors, as evidenced by its strategic cost structure adjustments and focus on high-margin segments like AWS and digital advertising.

Upcoming Product Launches

Amazon continues to innovate with upcoming product launches that span across its business segments. In the AI domain, the company is rumored to be working on an improved large language model codenamed ""Olympus,"" which could enhance its AI capabilities. The expansion of its generative AI offerings and the introduction of new services in AWS are expected to drive efficiency and cost savings for customers.

In the consumer hardware space, Amazon's hardware event previews and the rollout of new Alexa capabilities with generative AI demonstrate the company's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology into its consumer products.

Analyst Outlooks and Reasonings

Analysts remain optimistic about Amazon's growth prospects, citing the company's strong position in its respective markets and the potential for margin expansion. While there are concerns about the competitive pressures in cloud services and generative AI, Amazon's continuous efforts to innovate and reduce costs are expected to result in share gains over time.

The bullish outlook is further supported by Amazon's strategic partnerships, such as those with Salesforce (NYSE: ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), which facilitate the development and integration of AI technologies. Additionally, Amazon's advertising services continue to impress with high operating income margins, indicating a sustained growth path.

Conversely, the bearish perspectives are primarily centered around the competitive landscape and potential regulatory challenges. The emergence of new competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing could pose threats to Amazon's market share. Furthermore, cybersecurity risks and industry-wide increases in compute prices for reserved instances could impact the growth of AWS's security tools.

Bear Case

Is Amazon facing significant competitive threats?

The competitive landscape for Amazon is indeed intensifying, with new players such as Temu and Shein entering the e-commerce space and tech giants like Microsoft and Google ramping up their cloud offerings. These competitors could potentially erode Amazon's market share and challenge its dominance. Additionally, regulatory challenges and consumer price sensitivity add layers of complexity to Amazon's operations.

Can Amazon maintain its cloud market leadership?

While AWS continues to be a leader in cloud services, the pressure from competitors investing heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities cannot be overlooked. Amazon will need to continue innovating and offering cost-effective, high-performance solutions to maintain its market position and address any concerns regarding the durability of its growth in the face of such competition.

Bull Case

Will Amazon's AI investments lead to growth acceleration?

Amazon's commitment to AI, as evidenced by its investments and product launches, positions the company to potentially lead in generative AI and cloud computing. The development of new AI chips and services, along with strategic partnerships, could drive further efficiency and cost savings for AWS customers, leading to growth acceleration.

Can Amazon's advertising segment sustain its momentum?

The digital advertising segment presents a significant growth opportunity for Amazon. With the company's vast consumer data and the introduction of video ads on Prime Video, there is a strong potential for sustained momentum in advertising revenue, contributing to Amazon's overall profitability.

2022-12-04, IANS,"GenAI will speed up drug discovery, boost healthcare in India: Top AWS executive",https://in.investing.com/news/genai-will-speed-up-drug-discovery-boost-healthcare-in-india-top-aws-executive-3923010,"New Delhi, Dec 4 (IANS) Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform drug discovery and healthcare delivery in a country like India which has top-level medical experts with the right kind of experience in this new-age technology, a top Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) executive has said.Dr Rowland Illing, Director and Chief Medical Officer, International Public Sector Health, AWS, told IANS that they are delighted to support the Indian Government and the Union Health Ministry in building next-generation healthcare solutions for the population.

“There is an incredible opportunity because India is such a great technology-based country with some real experts at great health-tech companies. We have a great team working in India with the Indian Government and at the state level as well. GenAI with Cloud has the true potential to transform the healthcare industry in India,” Dr Illing said on the sidelines of the AWS re:Invent conference in the US last week.

The Covid-19 pandemic saw the rapid emergence of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in providing timely and quality healthcare for millions. Healthtech startup Qure.ai created a niche for itself with advanced technology that reads and interprets medical images like X-rays, CTs, and ultrasounds in less than a minute, making equitable and high-quality healthcare a reality across the globe.

“They have built some amazing diagnostic AI tools like the one for chest X-rays looking at detecting tuberculosis (TB). Users can upload X-ray imaging into the Cloud, have it analysed and the local healthcare provider can then either start treatment or may not need treatment based upon the AI output,” said Dr Illing.

According to him, this is all about the democratisation of GenAI and India is a great place for this as there is “a great ambition within the government to accelerate healthcare and to democratise access by using Cloud which is the only way to scale.”

AWS, the Cloud arm of Amazon, in September announced that the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has chosen it as its preferred Cloud provider to accelerate its genome sequencing research projects.

CCMB performed short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping — an analysis to determine a person’s DNA profile — on 3,200 samples from the ‘1000 Genomes Project’, an international research effort to establish a detailed catalogue of human genetic variation.

Using services such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon S3, and AWS Batch, CCMB was able to reduce the time taken for research analysis by up to 98 per cent — from 550 days to just nine days on average.

In another project, CCMB has started analysing breast cancer samples to identify molecular signatures of triple negative breast cancers among the Indian population. Using CPU and GPU-accelerated computing on AWS, CCMB brought down the time taken of analysis per sample by 50 to 70 per cent.

Dr Illing told IANS that genomics is the biggest healthcare use case for Cloud at the moment because organisations that use genomics or genetics are unable to just manage that kind of infrastructure required in order to both store and compute on massive datasets.

“CCMB started its genome sequencing research on AWS just now and that has been a great partnership. India will be one of the powerhouses of genomics as a result,” he added.

“Generative AI will be an accelerator to global healthcare. Using AWS Cloud, the companies can build solutions in a highly-controlled and secure manner, especially in India,” said Dr Illing.

2022-12-10, IANS,"Amazon competitor Zulily curtails operations, lays off hundreds",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-competitor-zulily-curtails-operations-lays-off-hundreds-3931529,"San Francisco, Dec 10 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) competition Zulily, which was once valued at $7 billion, is laying off hundreds of employees in the US while shutting down operations, according to media reports and state filings.Zulily will lay off 292 workers in Seattle and elsewhere in Washington, effective from February 7, according to a notification from the state Employment Security Department, reports Seattle Times.

The 13-year-old company is also shutting down its Pioneer Square (NYSE: ) headquarters and several other facilities in other states, according to GeekWire.

The closing of warehouses in Nevada and Ohio will result in another 547 layoffs, according to notices from both states.

The latest job cuts follow several earlier rounds of layoffs at Zulily, as well as the resignation of its CEO Terry Boyle in October.

Zulily was launched in 2010 by Mark Vadon and Darrell Cavens, former executives with online jewellery retailer Blue Nile.

In 2013, Zulily had 12.6 million active customers, and made $331 million in revenue, up nearly 700 per cent from 2010.

Zulily went public in 2013 in an IPO originally valued at $2.6 billion and but by the end of the first day, that figure almost doubled, according to media reports.

By 2014, Zulily had a market value of $7 billion on annual sales of $1 billion.

“Only Amazon and Old Navy hit the billion-dollar revenue mark in a shorter amount of time,” according to reports.

In 2015, Zulily was purchased by Liberty Interactive-QVC, later renamed Qurate, for a reported $2.4 billion.

In May this year, Qurate sold the company to Los Angeles private equity firm Regent.

2022-12-09, IANS,Amazon sues scammers for stealing millions of dollars via fake returns,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-sues-scammers-for-stealing-millions-of-dollars-via-fake-returns-3931186,"San Francisco, Dec 9 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has sued an enterprising group called REKK, which is responsible for stealing millions of dollars of products from Amazon’s online stores through systematic refund abuse.Through the lawsuit, Amazon said it aims to expose their conspiracy and hold them accountable for their fraudulent activity. Protecting customers and earning the trust of selling partners are core values at Amazon.

Retail theft is a persistent problem that plagues online and physical retailers alike.

“One form of retail theft involves systematic refund fraud, which undermines Amazon’s ability to efficiently serve customers and selling partners. Customers who shop in Amazon’s online stores should be delighted with their purchases, and if they are not, they should be able to easily return the product,” the lawsuit read.

Among other places, REKK operates a Telegram channel that has over 30,000 followers, where they brazenly advertise refund services that they fully admit are fraudulent.

“In this scheme, bad actors who want a free product (like an iPad) pay REKK a fee (such as 30 per cent of the product’s cost) to obtain a fraudulent refund,” according to the lawsuit.

REKK uses sophisticated methods to obtain the refund, including socially engineering Amazon customer service, phishing Amazon employees, manipulating Amazon’s systems through unauthorised access, and bribing Amazon insiders to grant refunds.

The scheme tricks Amazon into processing refunds for products that are never returned, instead of returning the products as promised.

“Defendants keep the product and the refund. REKK boasts that the organisation has fraudulently refunded over 100,000 orders from retailers (not just Amazon),” said Amazon.

The survey supports e-commerce acceleration into 2024, and the investment bank believes names such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), and Wayfair (NYSE: ) are well-positioned to gain market share.

BofA surveyed over 1,000 US consumers across ages and incomes to monitor e-commerce trends and inflections. It revealed the higher intention to spend more online driven by convenience.

""According to our survey, 42% (up a strong 10pts vs. 32% last year) of respondents plan to increase eCommerce spending over the next 12 months, likely due to fading reopening headwinds. Per our survey, convenience is the top driver moving purchases Online while the biggest drawback to Online (inability to try the product) becoming less of a concern y/y,"" explained BofA.

""Data indicates low prices and shipping times are increasingly important for an eCommerce platform, and we think retailers with value pricing (Amazon, Walmart, Wayfair) are well positioned to gain share in 2024,"" analysts added.

Amazon is the investment bank's top choice for e-commerce, with the platform remaining ""by far, the most popular eComm site,"" said BofA, with 64% of respondents searching Amazon first when buying products.

""Per our survey, a record 78% have Prime membership (+1pt y/y despite higher y/y intention to churn), Prime users spend 2.6x vs. non-Prime, and a growing 68% of Prime members use Prime Video, which we think positions Amazon well for a Prime ad ramp in '24,"" said the firm.

Meanwhile, 27% of respondents prefer Walmart as the top grocery website, followed by Amazon at 19%.

""For SMID cap, Wayfair is our top pick given expected share gains vs. home furnishings industry and potential for higher leverage incremental revenue. Walmart continues to see traction with grocery and with Walmart+,"" concluded BofA's analysts."
2022-12-08, IANS,Amazon testing $9.99 monthly grocery subscription for Prime members,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-testing-999-monthly-grocery-subscription-for-prime-members-3930130,"San Francisco, Dec 8 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has announced that it's testing a new subscription model for unlimited grocery delivery for Prime members in three cities of the US.For an additional monthly charge of $9.99, Prime members in Denver, Sacramento and Columbus can get unlimited delivery on Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods orders over $35, reports The Verge.

Those who subscribe to this plan will also receive unlimited 30-minute pick-up on orders of any size.

""We're always experimenting with features to make shopping easier, faster, and more affordable, and we look forward to hearing how members who take advantage of this offer respond,"" Tony Hoggett, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores, was quoted as saying.

Prime members presently pay $6.95 for Fresh orders between $50 and $100, and $9.95 for items under $50.

However, Prime members were not always required to pay for Fresh delivery on orders over $35. Amazon began charging delivery costs for Fresh grocery orders under $150 in January, removing a benefit that allowed Prime members free delivery on orders over $35.

Amazon then reversed its decision in October, lowering the free grocery delivery threshold from $150 to $100.

In September, Amazon announced that it will introduce 'limited advertisements' to its Prime Video streaming service in 2024 as it aims to put more cash into creating TV shows and films.

In addition, the company said it will roll out the ""ad-free"" subscription tier for an extra $2.99 per month for Prime members in the US -- a similar move which was taken by competitors such as Disney+ and Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies like Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Last week, retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) confirmed that it is not advertising on X. In October, data found that X lost over half a billion user visits in September, and the platform dropped to seventh place on the global ranking, behind Instagram.

In September, X's traffic dropped from 6.4 billion to 5.8 billion, a loss of 10 per cent, according to new SimilarWeb data.

Of the 176 countries that visited X in September, 83 per cent saw a month-on-month decline in visits. Musk recently stunned the world when he told advertisers to ""go f*** yourself"" after some top companies pulled advertising on his platform over his endorsement of anti-Semitism.

However, he later apologised for what he called his ""dumbest"" social media post to date.

Analysts cited rising margins and AWS revenue accelerations.

Analysts reiterated their Outperform rating and raised their price target on Amazon to $200 from $180.

""Key drivers for AMZN shares in '24 are i) Record Op Inc Margins driven by AWS & Adv segments, with ""rest of biz"" turning profitable; and ii) Accelerating AWS rev growth, as co's lap cost optimizations,"" analysts commented.

First, the firm is forecasting 2024 operating income of $58 billion, which is 25% above consensus, yielding 9.1% operating income margins, ""as high-margin AWS and Advertising businesses continue to scale while ""rest of biz"" Op Inc turns positive after significant cost-cutting and easing inflationary & FX headwinds."" They estimate that the""rest of biz"" 2024 operating income will be around $4 billion following more than $38 billion in losses from '21-'23.

Moving forward, there's an anticipation of an upsurge in AWS revenue growth as AWS moves beyond initial cost optimizations, based on the firm's public cloud survey indicating that 75% of customers will have completed optimizations by the close of 2022. Additionally, there's a noticeable acceleration in AWS bookings heading into the fourth quarter of 2022, which sets a promising tone for the upcoming year and beyond.

Commenting on what is underappreciated or misunderstood by investors, analysts highlight that in 2024, Amazon plans to introduce ads on Prime Video in the US, offering opt-out for $3/month. Projections indicate potential $1.5BN-$3BN ad revenue (assuming 4-8 mins of ads/hour) and $800MM from opt-out subscriptions, boosting estimates by 3-6% for ad revenue and ~2% for subscription revenue. Expansion to major international markets is slated for later in '24.

On catalysts and milestones to watch, analysts noted as enterprises move beyond recent cost optimizations, AWS is poised to benefit from a shift in focus towards migrating more workloads to the Public Cloud. The integration of Generative AI tools throughout AWS products is expected to drive additional revenue, with 74% of IT buyers already earmarking budget for or seriously considering GenAI. Additionally, the introduction of ad-supported Prime Video is anticipated to boost ad revenue growth. Moreover, the Retail business aims to enhance conversion rates and unit growth by doubling delivery stations, further accelerating delivery speed."
2022-12-07, Investing.com,Amazon cuts fees on low-cost apparel to compete with Shein and Temu,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-cuts-fees-on-lowcost-apparel-to-compete-with-shein-and-temu-93CH-3928811,"SEATTLE - In a strategic move to maintain its dominance in the U.S. online retail market, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has announced a significant reduction in fees for apparel-related products priced under $20. Starting January next year, items under $15 will be subject to a mere 5% fee, while those priced between $15 and $20 will incur a 10% fee. This is a substantial drop from the former uniform fee of 17%.

Amazon's decision comes as it faces increasing competition from fast fashion brands such as Shein and Temu, which has disrupted the industry with its agile business model. Shein adds up to thousands of new products daily and is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) with a valuation aimed at $90 billion, following a private-market valuation of $66 billion last week. The brand has become particularly popular among Gen Z customers by producing limited batches of clothing based on real-time customer interactions, thus keeping inventory levels low and waste to a minimum.

However, Shein's rapid growth has not been without controversy. Allegations of forced labor and environmental damage have cast a shadow over the company's operations. An attempt to mitigate these concerns with an influencer trip showcasing factory conditions backfired, attracting criticism for both the influencers involved and Shein itself. Despite this, Shein maintains that it invests in factory workers' well-being by providing educational opportunities and ensuring safe work environments. They also claim that their suppliers' wages are competitive within their regions.

The fast fashion industry faces calls for regulation, and Shein’s head of strategic communications Peter Pernot-Day has suggested initiatives such as recycling campaigns similar to those for plastics. He advocates for public-private partnerships to fund developments in sustainable textiles and chemical recycling technologies.

With its substantial lead over competitors like Walmart (NYSE: ), Amazon is positioning itself to navigate through the challenges posed by new entrants like Temu. The e-commerce giant's latest fee reductions are part of a broader strategy to support merchants and stay ahead in the highly competitive online marketplace.

In the ever-evolving landscape of global technology companies, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). stands as a colossus across various sectors, including e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. With a sprawling footprint that touches upon multiple facets of the digital and physical retail experience, Amazon's diverse portfolio has positioned it as a key player in numerous markets. Analysts have been closely monitoring Amazon's performance and strategic moves, offering a wealth of insights into the company's current state and future prospects.

Performance in Different Markets

Amazon has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in its core e-commerce operations. Despite facing stiff competition and a dynamic retail environment, the company has maintained a robust growth trajectory, underpinned by its expansive product offerings and a sophisticated fulfillment network. The company's e-commerce segment continues to benefit from market consolidation and the enduring shift towards online shopping.

In cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands as a pillar of strength for the company. AWS has been a consistent revenue driver, showcasing Amazon's deep technical expertise and innovation capacity. With the cloud market poised for a post-pandemic recovery and acceleration, AWS is expected to grow in line with the industry, bolstered by large contract values and a burgeoning demand for AI-driven cloud workloads.

Digital advertising has emerged as another high-margin business for Amazon. The company's advertising segment has seen accelerated growth, with projections indicating a continuation of this trend. The upcoming launch of video ads on Prime Video is anticipated to unlock additional revenue streams, further cementing Amazon's position in the advertising space.

Product Segments and Details

Amazon's product segmentation reflects its strategic focus on diversification and innovation. The company's e-commerce platform remains its most visible segment, offering an extensive array of products that cater to a wide range of consumer needs. Amazon's physical store presence, including formats like Amazon Go, Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and Amazon Style stores, provides a tangible extension of its retail prowess.

AWS, as a standalone product segment, has been instrumental in establishing Amazon's dominance in the cloud services market. AWS's comprehensive suite of services, including computing power, storage solutions, and AI capabilities, has attracted a diverse customer base, ranging from startups to large enterprises.

The digital streaming and AI segments are increasingly becoming focal points for Amazon. Initiatives such as Prime Video and the development of Alexa's conversational abilities highlight the company's commitment to integrating AI into its services and improving the user experience.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

The competitive landscape for Amazon is multifaceted, with the company facing challenges across its various operations. In e-commerce, Amazon continues to fend off competition from traditional retailers and digital upstarts alike. The rise of Chinese retail platforms like Shein and Temu has introduced new competitive dynamics, although Amazon's robust supply chain and delivery advantages have helped it maintain its market leadership.

In cloud computing, AWS competes directly with other tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). While AWS has been a leader in scale and innovation, it operates in a market where competitors are also heavily investing in their cloud offerings, particularly in the realm of AI and machine learning.

The digital advertising space sees Amazon going head-to-head with established players like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ: ). However, Amazon's unique position as an e-commerce platform provides it with valuable consumer data that enhances its advertising capabilities.

Regulatory Environments

Regulatory scrutiny remains a persistent theme for Amazon. The company has faced investigations and legal challenges in various jurisdictions over its business practices. These include antitrust concerns related to its marketplace operations and potential anti-competitive behavior. While Amazon has navigated these issues with a degree of success, the regulatory environment continues to pose risks that could impact the company's strategic flexibility and operational efficiency.

Customer Base and Management

Amazon boasts a vast and diverse customer base, with over 300 million active customers as of March 2022. This customer base is a testament to the company's ability to attract and retain shoppers through competitive pricing, a broad selection of products, and a focus on convenience.

The company's management team has been pivotal in steering Amazon through various market cycles and challenges. Their strategic decisions, from expanding into new markets like healthcare to optimizing the company's vast fulfillment network, have played a crucial role in Amazon's sustained growth.

Strategy and External Factors

Amazon's strategy revolves around continuous innovation, customer-centricity, and expansion into new markets. The company's investments in AI and machine learning are indicative of its long-term vision to remain at the forefront of technological advancements. Additionally, Amazon's approach to physical retail, through acquisitions and the launch of new store formats, reflects its understanding of the evolving retail landscape.

External factors such as macroeconomic conditions, consumer spending patterns, and technological shifts have a significant impact on Amazon's operations. The company has shown an ability to adapt to these factors, as evidenced by its strategic cost structure adjustments and focus on high-margin segments like AWS and digital advertising.

Upcoming Product Launches

Amazon continues to innovate with upcoming product launches that span across its business segments. In the AI domain, the company is rumored to be working on an improved large language model codenamed ""Olympus,"" which could enhance its AI capabilities. The expansion of its generative AI offerings and the introduction of new services in AWS are expected to drive efficiency and cost savings for customers.

In the consumer hardware space, Amazon's hardware event previews and the rollout of new Alexa capabilities with generative AI demonstrate the company's commitment to integrating cutting-edge technology into its consumer products.

Analyst Outlooks and Reasonings

Analysts remain optimistic about Amazon's growth prospects, citing the company's strong position in its respective markets and the potential for margin expansion. While there are concerns about the competitive pressures in cloud services and generative AI, Amazon's continuous efforts to innovate and reduce costs are expected to result in share gains over time.

The bullish outlook is further supported by Amazon's strategic partnerships, such as those with Salesforce (NYSE: ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), which facilitate the development and integration of AI technologies. Additionally, Amazon's advertising services continue to impress with high operating income margins, indicating a sustained growth path.

Conversely, the bearish perspectives are primarily centered around the competitive landscape and potential regulatory challenges. The emergence of new competitors in e-commerce and cloud computing could pose threats to Amazon's market share. Furthermore, cybersecurity risks and industry-wide increases in compute prices for reserved instances could impact the growth of AWS's security tools.

Bear Case

Is Amazon facing significant competitive threats?

The competitive landscape for Amazon is indeed intensifying, with new players such as Temu and Shein entering the e-commerce space and tech giants like Microsoft and Google ramping up their cloud offerings. These competitors could potentially erode Amazon's market share and challenge its dominance. Additionally, regulatory challenges and consumer price sensitivity add layers of complexity to Amazon's operations.

Can Amazon maintain its cloud market leadership?

While AWS continues to be a leader in cloud services, the pressure from competitors investing heavily in AI and machine learning capabilities cannot be overlooked. Amazon will need to continue innovating and offering cost-effective, high-performance solutions to maintain its market position and address any concerns regarding the durability of its growth in the face of such competition.

Bull Case

Will Amazon's AI investments lead to growth acceleration?

Amazon's commitment to AI, as evidenced by its investments and product launches, positions the company to potentially lead in generative AI and cloud computing.

2022-12-04, IANS,"GenAI will speed up drug discovery, boost healthcare in India: Top AWS executive",https://in.investing.com/news/genai-will-speed-up-drug-discovery-boost-healthcare-in-india-top-aws-executive-3923010,"New Delhi, Dec 4 (IANS) Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform drug discovery and healthcare delivery in a country like India which has top-level medical experts with the right kind of experience in this new-age technology, a top Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) executive has said.Dr Rowland Illing, Director and Chief Medical Officer, International Public Sector Health, AWS, told IANS that they are delighted to support the Indian Government and the Union Health Ministry in building next-generation healthcare solutions for the population.

“There is an incredible opportunity because India is such a great technology-based country with some real experts at great health-tech companies. We have a great team working in India with the Indian Government and at the state level as well. GenAI with Cloud has the true potential to transform the healthcare industry in India,” Dr Illing said on the sidelines of the AWS re:Invent conference in the US last week.

The Covid-19 pandemic saw the rapid emergence of AI and Machine Learning (ML) in providing timely and quality healthcare for millions. Healthtech startup Qure.ai created a niche for itself with advanced technology that reads and interprets medical images like X-rays, CTs, and ultrasounds in less than a minute, making equitable and high-quality healthcare a reality across the globe.

“They have built some amazing diagnostic AI tools like the one for chest X-rays looking at detecting tuberculosis (TB). Users can upload X-ray imaging into the Cloud, have it analysed and the local healthcare provider can then either start treatment or may not need treatment based upon the AI output,” said Dr Illing.

According to him, this is all about the democratisation of GenAI and India is a great place for this as there is “a great ambition within the government to accelerate healthcare and to democratise access by using Cloud which is the only way to scale.”

AWS, the Cloud arm of Amazon, in September announced that the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has chosen it as its preferred Cloud provider to accelerate its genome sequencing research projects.

CCMB performed short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping — an analysis to determine a person’s DNA profile — on 3,200 samples from the ‘1000 Genomes Project’, an international research effort to establish a detailed catalogue of human genetic variation.

Using services such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon S3, and AWS Batch, CCMB was able to reduce the time taken for research analysis by up to 98 per cent — from 550 days to just nine days on average.

In another project, CCMB has started analysing breast cancer samples to identify molecular signatures of triple negative breast cancers among the Indian population. Using CPU and GPU-accelerated computing on AWS, CCMB brought down the time taken of analysis per sample by 50 to 70 per cent.

Dr Illing told IANS that genomics is the biggest healthcare use case for Cloud at the moment because organisations that use genomics or genetics are unable to just manage that kind of infrastructure required in order to both store and compute on massive datasets.

“CCMB started its genome sequencing research on AWS just now and that has been a great partnership. India will be one of the powerhouses of genomics as a result,” he added.

“Generative AI will be an accelerator to global healthcare. Using AWS Cloud, the companies can build solutions in a highly-controlled and secure manner, especially in India,” said Dr Illing.

2022-12-02, IANS,Amazon signs 3 launches with Musk’s SpaceX to support ‘Project Kuiper’,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-signs-3-launches-with-musks-spacex-to-support-project-kuiper-3922026,"San Francisco, Dec 2 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has signed a contract with Elon Musk’s SpaceX for three Falcon 9 launches to support deployment plans for Project Kuiper, its low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband network. The three Falcon 9 missions are targeted to lift off starting in mid-2025.

Kuiper is planning a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit and the US Federal Communications Commission required Amazon to deploy at least half of that figure by 2026.

Project Kuiper satellites were designed from the start to accommodate multiple launch providers and vehicles, allowing us to reduce schedule risk and move faster in our mission to connect unserved and underserved communities around the world.

“Our earlier procurement of 77 heavy-lift rockets from Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) provides enough capacity to launch the majority of our satellite constellation, and the additional launches with SpaceX offer even more capacity to support our deployment schedule,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage launch vehicle designed for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond, and it has completed more than 270 successful launches to date.

Project Kuiper has contracted three Falcon 9 launches, and these missions are targeted to lift off beginning in mid-2025.

“Project Kuiper recently launched two prototype satellites, and tests from the mission have helped validate our satellite design and network architecture,” said Amazon.

“We are preparing to start satellite manufacturing ahead of a full-scale deployment beginning in the first half of 2024, and we expect to have enough satellites deployed to begin early customer pilots in the second half of 2024,” the company added.

2022-12-01, IANS,GenAI needs to gain cultural fluency like humans: Amazon CTO,https://in.investing.com/news/genai-needs-to-gain-cultural-fluency-like-humans-amazon-cto-3921504,"Las Vegas, Dec 1 (IANS) In the coming years, culture will play a crucial role in how generative Ai is designed, deployed and consumed, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CTO Dr Werner Vogels has said.Large language models (LLMs) trained on culturally diverse data will gain a more nuanced understanding of human experience and complex societal challenges in 2024.

""This cultural fluency promises to make generative AI more accessible to users worldwide,” Vogels said during the AWS ‘re: Invent’ conference here.

For LLM-based systems to reach a world-wide audience, they need to achieve the type of cultural fluency that comes instinctively to humans.

In a paper published earlier this year, researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology demonstrated that even when an LLM was provided with a prompt in Arabic that explicitly mentioned Islamic prayer, responses were generated that recommended grabbing an alcoholic beverage with friends, which isn’t culturally appropriate.

According to Vogels, a lot of this has to do with the training data that’s available.

“Common Crawl, which has been used to train many LLMs, is roughly 46 per cent English, and an even greater percentage of the content available — regardless of language — is culturally Western (skewing significantly towards the United States),” he noted.

In the past few months, non-Western LLMs have started to emerge: Jais, trained on Arabic and English data, Yi-34B, a bilingual Chinese/English model, and Japanese-large-lm, trained on an extensive Japanese web corpus.

“These are signs that culturally accurate non-Western models will open up generative AI to hundreds of millions of people with impacts ranging far and wide, from education to medical care,” the Amazon CTO emphasised.

Just as humans learn from discussion, debate, and the exchange of ideas, LLMs need similar opportunities to expand their perspectives and understand culture.

According to him, two areas of research will play a pivotal role in this cultural exchange.

One is reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), in which a model incorporates feedback from another model.

In this scenario, different models can interact with each other and update their own understandings of different cultural concepts based on these interactions.

“Second is collaboration through multi-agent debate, in which multiple instances of a model generate responses, debate the validity of each response and the reasoning behind it, and finally come to an agreed upon answer through this debate process. Both areas of research reduce the human cost it takes to train and fine-tune models,” Vogels noted.

As LLMs interact and learn from each other, they will gain more nuanced understandings of complex societal challenges informed by diverse cultural lenses, he added.

Mitkumar Patel's body was found on the riverbank at Caledonian Wharf, on the Isle of Dogs, at roughly 10.45 a.m. on November 21 by a passerby, The Standard newspaper reported.

Patel, who had been staying with a cousin in Plaistow, east London, was supposed to move to Sheffield on November 20, to start a degree at Sheffield Hallam University and a part-time job at Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Patel's cousin grew worried when he failed to return home from a daily walk on November 17 and filed a missing person complaint with the police next day.

His other cousins began contacting missing persons charities, and canvassing areas he frequented with posters and flyers, the news report said.

One of the cousins said in the days before his death, Patel had sent a relative a series of voice messages in which he outlined a plan to end his life.

Scotland Yard confirmed police, paramedics and the fire brigade responded to reports a man's body had been found on the riverbank at Caledonian Wharf.

""Officers believe they know the identity of the deceased. The death is not believed to be suspicious,"" a spokesperson was quoted as saying in The Standard. Patel's cousins have launched a fundraiser to repatriate his body back to India.

""He belonged to a farmer family and used to live in a village. So we decided do fundraising for helping out his family and to send his body to India,"" Patel's cousin wrote in the fundraiser.

2022-11-30, IANS,Our own chips in GenAI era best path to make customers’ lives better: Andy Jassy,https://in.investing.com/news/our-own-chips-in-genai-era-best-path-to-make-customers-lives-better-andy-jassy-3920266,"Las Vegas, Nov 30 (IANS) Designing our own chips is the best path to makes our customers’ lives better and easier every day in the generative AI era, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday.Jassy said that several years ago, when Amazon started pursuing building its own chips, “a lot of folks thought this was nuts”.

“We heard a lot of the same refrains you often hear — why make this investment, why invest in a team and all the other fixed costs to develop your own chip when you can buy from other suppliers?” Jassy posted on X amid the company’s ‘re: Invent 2022’ conference here.

He said that Amazon was lucky to find and join forces with the amazing Annapurna Labs team, who started with a chip (named Nitro) that offloaded security, networking, and some other virtualization functions from our servers so customers could use more of the server than they could before.

“Then, that team built a generalised CPU chip, Graviton, which has been very popular and impactful for customers, before embarking on building custom AI chips — Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference)—which are also off to a strong start,” Jassy informed.

Earlier this week, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky unveiled the next generation of two AWS-designed chips — Graviton4 and Trainium2 — for a broad range of customer workloads, including machine learning (ML) training and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Graviton4 provides up to 30 per cent better compute performance, 50 per cent more cores, and 75 per cent more memory bandwidth than current generation Graviton3 processors, delivering the best price performance and energy efficiency for a broad range of workloads running on Amazon EC2.

Jassy said he is very excited about the most recent chips.

“Graviton4 marks the fourth generation we’ve delivered in just five years, and it’s the most powerful and energy efficient multipurpose chip we have built to date,” Amazon CEO said.

With the surge of interest in generative AI, Trainium2 will help customers train their ML models faster, at a more advantaged price-performance, he added.

Amazon’s Titan (NS: ) family of foundation models is built to detect and remove harmful content in the data that customers provide for customisation, reject inappropriate content in the user input, and filter the model’s outputs containing inappropriate content such as hate speech, profanity, and violence.

Amazon CodeWhisperer is the only AI coding companion with built-in security scanning for finding and suggesting remediations for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities.

“Amazon SageMaker Clarify detects and measures potential bias using a variety of metrics so developers can address potential bias and explain model predictions,” said Sivasubramanian who has been working in Amazon for more than 15 years.

At its flagship ‘re: Invent 2022’ conference here, AWS launched Amazon Titan Image Generator that can create new images with text description or customise existing images.

As a content creator, you can now use the image generator to quickly create and refine images using English natural language prompts.

“You can use the model to easily swap out an existing background to the background of a rainforest, or can use the model to seamlessly swap out backgrounds to generate lifestyle images, all while retaining the main subject of the image and to create a few more options,” said Sivasubramanian.

Titan Image Generator also mitigates harmful content generation to support the responsible use of AI.

“All images generated by Amazon Titan contain an invisible watermark, by default, designed to help reduce the spread of misinformation by providing a discreet mechanism to identify AI-generated images,” Sivasubramanian told IANS.

The image generator will help companies in advertising, e-commerce, and media and entertainment to create studio-quality, realistic images in large volumes and at low cost.

In July, Amazon joined US President Joe Biden and leaders across government and industry to commit to continue promoting the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology that benefits society.

“We build AI with responsibility in mind at each stage of our comprehensive development process. Throughout design, development, deployment, and operations we consider a range of factors including accuracy, fairness, appropriate usage, toxicity, security, safety, and privacy,” Sivasubramanian noted.

2022-11-29, IANS,Amazon introduces its own AI-powered image generator,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-introduces-its-own-aipowered-image-generator-3918479,"Las Vegas, Nov 29 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) on Wednesday joined its rivals in launching Amazon Titan (NS: ) Image Generator that can create new images given a text description or customise existing images.As a content creator, you can now use the image generator to quickly create and refine images using English natural language prompts, the company said.

“You can use the model to easily swap out an existing background to background of a rainforest, or can use the model to seamlessly swap out backgrounds to generate lifestyle images, all while retaining the main subject of the image and to create a few more options,” said Swami Sivasubramanian, Swami Sivasubramanian, Vice President of Database, Analytics, and Machine Learning, at the ‘re: Invent 2022’ conference here.

The image generator will help companies in advertising, e-commerce, and media and entertainment to create studio-quality, realistic images in large volumes and at low cost.

The model can understand complex prompts with multiple objects and generates relevant images.

It is trained on high-quality, diverse data to create more accurate outputs, such as realistic images with inclusive attributes and limited distortions.

“In addition, you can customize the model with proprietary data to generate images consistent with your brand guidelines or to generate images in a specific style, for example, by fine-tuning the model with images from a previous marketing campaign,” the company said.

Titan Image Generator also mitigates harmful content generation to support the responsible use of AI.

All images generated by Amazon Titan contain an invisible watermark, by default, designed to help reduce the spread of misinformation by providing a discreet mechanism to identify AI-generated images, said AWS.

The company also introduced two new Amazon Titan multimodal foundation models and Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings.

“Amazon Titan Text Lite and Amazon Titan Text Express are now generally available in Amazon Bedrock. You can now choose from three available Amazon Titan Text FMs, including Amazon Titan Text Embeddings,” said the company.

Amazon Titan models incorporate 25 years of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) innovation at Amazon and offer a range of high-performing image, multimodal, and text model options through a fully managed API.

AWS also announced the availability of Anthropic’s Claude 2.1 foundation model (FM) in Amazon Bedrock.

Last week, Anthropic introduced its latest model, Claude 2.1 with reduced rates of hallucination, improved accuracy over long documents, system prompts, and a beta tool use feature for function calling and workflow orchestration.

Since launching in June 2022, the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center team of strategists, data scientists, machine learning (ML) engineers, and solutions architects have worked with hundreds of customers worldwide, and helped them ideate, prioritize, and build bespoke solutions that harness the power of generative AI.

Now, AWS has announced the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center Custom Model Programme for Anthropic Claude.

Starting in Q1 2024, customers can engage with researchers and ML scientists from the Generative AI Innovation Center to fine-tune Anthropic Claude models securely with their own proprietary data.

Additionally, the tech giant displayed search ads not only on its own platform but also on third-party websites within the ""Google Search Partner network"", including YouTube.

The report further found that the company was showing ads on websites alongside explicit and pirated content and that ads, for instance, for the US Secret Service, FBI, and the US Treasury, were found on a Russian and an Iranian-sanctioned website.

""These included websites such as Breitbart.com, sites containing pirated content, hardcore pornographic sites, and hundreds of putative Iranian websites, which may potentially be under US Treasury Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC) sanctions,"" the report said.

The three Falcon 9 missions are targeted to lift off starting in mid-2025.

Kuiper is planning a constellation of 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit and the US Federal Communications Commission required Amazon to deploy at least half of that figure by 2026.

Project Kuiper satellites were designed from the start to accommodate multiple launch providers and vehicles, allowing us to reduce schedule risk and move faster in our mission to connect unserved and underserved communities around the world.

“Our earlier procurement of 77 heavy-lift rockets from Arianespace, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance (ULA) provides enough capacity to launch the majority of our satellite constellation, and the additional launches with SpaceX offer even more capacity to support our deployment schedule,” the company said in a statement late on Friday.

SpaceX’s Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage launch vehicle designed for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond, and it has completed more than 270 successful launches to date.

Project Kuiper has contracted three Falcon 9 launches, and these missions are targeted to lift off beginning in mid-2025.

“Project Kuiper recently launched two prototype satellites, and tests from the mission have helped validate our satellite design and network architecture,” said Amazon.

“We are preparing to start satellite manufacturing ahead of a full-scale deployment beginning in the first half of 2024, and we expect to have enough satellites deployed to begin early customer pilots in the second half of 2024,” the company added.

Choosing the Right Cryptocurrency

2022-12-01, IANS,GenAI needs to gain cultural fluency like humans: Amazon CTO,https://in.investing.com/news/genai-needs-to-gain-cultural-fluency-like-humans-amazon-cto-3921504,"Las Vegas, Dec 1 (IANS) In the coming years, culture will play a crucial role in how generative Ai is designed, deployed and consumed, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CTO Dr Werner Vogels has said.Large language models (LLMs) trained on culturally diverse data will gain a more nuanced understanding of human experience and complex societal challenges in 2024.

""This cultural fluency promises to make generative AI more accessible to users worldwide,” Vogels said during the AWS ‘re: Invent’ conference here.

For LLM-based systems to reach a world-wide audience, they need to achieve the type of cultural fluency that comes instinctively to humans.

In a paper published earlier this year, researchers from Georgia Institute of Technology demonstrated that even when an LLM was provided with a prompt in Arabic that explicitly mentioned Islamic prayer, responses were generated that recommended grabbing an alcoholic beverage with friends, which isn’t culturally appropriate.

According to Vogels, a lot of this has to do with the training data that’s available.

“Common Crawl, which has been used to train many LLMs, is roughly 46 per cent English, and an even greater percentage of the content available — regardless of language — is culturally Western (skewing significantly towards the United States),” he noted.

In the past few months, non-Western LLMs have started to emerge: Jais, trained on Arabic and English data, Yi-34B, a bilingual Chinese/English model, and Japanese-large-lm, trained on an extensive Japanese web corpus.

“These are signs that culturally accurate non-Western models will open up generative AI to hundreds of millions of people with impacts ranging far and wide, from education to medical care,” the Amazon CTO emphasised.

Just as humans learn from discussion, debate, and the exchange of ideas, LLMs need similar opportunities to expand their perspectives and understand culture.

According to him, two areas of research will play a pivotal role in this cultural exchange.

One is reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), in which a model incorporates feedback from another model.

In this scenario, different models can interact with each other and update their own understandings of different cultural concepts based on these interactions.

“Second is collaboration through multi-agent debate, in which multiple instances of a model generate responses, debate the validity of each response and the reasoning behind it, and finally come to an agreed upon answer through this debate process. Both areas of research reduce the human cost it takes to train and fine-tune models,” Vogels noted.

As LLMs interact and learn from each other, they will gain more nuanced understandings of complex societal challenges informed by diverse cultural lenses, he added.

Mitkumar Patel's body was found on the riverbank at Caledonian Wharf, on the Isle of Dogs, at roughly 10.45 a.m. on November 21 by a passerby, The Standard newspaper reported.

Patel, who had been staying with a cousin in Plaistow, east London, was supposed to move to Sheffield on November 20, to start a degree at Sheffield Hallam University and a part-time job at Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Patel's cousin grew worried when he failed to return home from a daily walk on November 17 and filed a missing person complaint with the police next day.

His other cousins began contacting missing persons charities, and canvassing areas he frequented with posters and flyers, the news report said.

One of the cousins said in the days before his death, Patel had sent a relative a series of voice messages in which he outlined a plan to end his life.

Scotland Yard confirmed police, paramedics and the fire brigade responded to reports a man's body had been found on the riverbank at Caledonian Wharf.

""Officers believe they know the identity of the deceased. The death is not believed to be suspicious,"" a spokesperson was quoted as saying in The Standard. Patel's cousins have launched a fundraiser to repatriate his body back to India.

""He belonged to a farmer family and used to live in a village. So we decided do fundraising for helping out his family and to send his body to India,"" Patel's cousin wrote in the fundraiser.

“We heard a lot of the same refrains you often hear — why make this investment, why invest in a team and all the other fixed costs to develop your own chip when you can buy from other suppliers?” Jassy posted on X amid the company’s ‘re: Invent 2022’ conference here.

He said that Amazon was lucky to find and join forces with the amazing Annapurna Labs team, who started with a chip (named Nitro) that offloaded security, networking, and some other virtualization functions from our servers so customers could use more of the server than they could before.

“Then, that team built a generalised CPU chip, Graviton, which has been very popular and impactful for customers, before embarking on building custom AI chips — Trainium (for training) and Inferentia (for inference)—which are also off to a strong start,” Jassy informed.

Earlier this week, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky unveiled the next generation of two AWS-designed chips — Graviton4 and Trainium2 — for a broad range of customer workloads, including machine learning (ML) training and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications.

Graviton4 provides up to 30 per cent better compute performance, 50 per cent more cores, and 75 per cent more memory bandwidth than current generation Graviton3 processors, delivering the best price performance and energy efficiency for a broad range of workloads running on Amazon EC2.

Jassy said he is very excited about the most recent chips.

“Graviton4 marks the fourth generation we’ve delivered in just five years, and it’s the most powerful and energy efficient multipurpose chip we have built to date,” Amazon CEO said.

With the surge of interest in generative AI, Trainium2 will help customers train their ML models faster, at a more advantaged price-performance, he added.

“We take these issues super seriously and have been engaging with policymakers on developing responsible AI. We were one of the few companies which made voluntary commitments in the White House on how we build these AI models, especially the future models, in a safe and responsible manner,” Sivasubramanian emphasised.

At AWS, “We are committed to continued collaboration with the policymakers, the technology industry, researchers, and the AI community to advance the responsible and secure use of AI,” he added.

Amazon’s Titan (NS: ) family of foundation models is built to detect and remove harmful content in the data that customers provide for customisation, reject inappropriate content in the user input, and filter the model’s outputs containing inappropriate content such as hate speech, profanity, and violence.

Amazon CodeWhisperer is the only AI coding companion with built-in security scanning for finding and suggesting remediations for hard-to-detect vulnerabilities.

“Amazon SageMaker Clarify detects and measures potential bias using a variety of metrics so developers can address potential bias and explain model predictions,” said Sivasubramanian who has been working in Amazon for more than 15 years.

At its flagship ‘re: Invent 2022’ conference here, AWS launched Amazon Titan Image Generator that can create new images with text description or customise existing images.

As a content creator, you can now use the image generator to quickly create and refine images using English natural language prompts.

“You can use the model to easily swap out an existing background to the background of a rainforest, or can use the model to seamlessly swap out backgrounds to generate lifestyle images, all while retaining the main subject of the image and to create a few more options,” said Sivasubramanian.

Titan Image Generator also mitigates harmful content generation to support the responsible use of AI.

“All images generated by Amazon Titan contain an invisible watermark, by default, designed to help reduce the spread of misinformation by providing a discreet mechanism to identify AI-generated images,” Sivasubramanian told IANS.

The image generator will help companies in advertising, e-commerce, and media and entertainment to create studio-quality, realistic images in large volumes and at low cost.

In July, Amazon joined US President Joe Biden and leaders across government and industry to commit to continue promoting the safe, secure, and transparent development of AI technology that benefits society.

“We build AI with responsibility in mind at each stage of our comprehensive development process. Throughout design, development, deployment, and operations we consider a range of factors including accuracy, fairness, appropriate usage, toxicity, security, safety, and privacy,” Sivasubramanian noted.

The model can understand complex prompts with multiple objects and generates relevant images.

It is trained on high-quality, diverse data to create more accurate outputs, such as realistic images with inclusive attributes and limited distortions.

“In addition, you can customize the model with proprietary data to generate images consistent with your brand guidelines or to generate images in a specific style, for example, by fine-tuning the model with images from a previous marketing campaign,” the company said.

Titan Image Generator also mitigates harmful content generation to support the responsible use of AI.

All images generated by Amazon Titan contain an invisible watermark, by default, designed to help reduce the spread of misinformation by providing a discreet mechanism to identify AI-generated images, said AWS.

The company also introduced two new Amazon Titan multimodal foundation models and Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings.

“Amazon Titan Text Lite and Amazon Titan Text Express are now generally available in Amazon Bedrock. You can now choose from three available Amazon Titan Text FMs, including Amazon Titan Text Embeddings,” said the company.

2022-11-28, Investing.com,Amazon announces ,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-announces-record-black-friday-cyber-monday-event-amid-deep-discounts-3916548,"Investing.com -- Amazon's extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday promotional drive this year was its largest ever, the e-commerce giant announced on Tuesday, as the company rolled out deeper discounts to entice price-conscious consumers.

On a global basis, customers ordered more than a billion items on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) during the sales event, which lasted from Nov. 17 through Nov. 27.

The company noted that demand was particularly high for products like skin treatments, video doorbells, carpet cleaners, and recent movie titles such as ""Barbie"" and ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One"" on its Prime Video service. It was also boosted by the National Football League's inaugural Black Friday game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, which was streamed on Prime Video.

In a statement, Amazon said that shoppers saved almost 70% more on its platform compared to the same 11-day period last year, although it did not state how much was spent in total on the website during that time.

The announcement comes as media reports suggest that spending by U.S. consumers is expected to have surged to a record high of over $12 billion on Cyber Monday, while American retail sales both online and in stores on Black Friday grew by 2.5% annually.

Helping to push up expenditures this year has been a move by retailers to slash prices and roll out ""buy now, pay later"" short-term financing schemes in order to persuade inflation-squeezed consumers to open up their wallets.

Analysts at Wedbush noted that much of the spending activity has not been on big-ticket items like electronics and appliances, echoing recent outlooks for the key holiday shopping season from several U.S. retailers. As a result, the Wedbush analysts flagged ""modest risk"" to sales forecasts for the holidays and ""incremental"" pressures from the heavy promotions.

""It is still too early to determine whether retail sales will be as strong as forecasted for this full holiday season, especially given a volatile consumer and competitive environment,"" the Wedbush analysts said.

However, they argued that Amazon and other companies with strong online offerings and a ""best-in-class"" fulfillment service are well-positioned to ""finish the year on a strong note."""

2022-11-28, Investing.com,These 4 internet stocks are best positioned to benefit from this holiday season - GS,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/these-4-internet-stocks-are-best-positioned-to-benefit-from-this-holiday-season--gs-432SI-3916256,"Goldman Sachs tech analysts weighed in on this year’s holiday season and shared their key takeaways from Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotional campaigns.

Adobe (NASDAQ: ) reported record-breaking U.S. online sales during Thanksgiving, increasing by 5.5% YoY and matching Adobe's forecast. Black Friday saw a YoY growth of 7.5%, surpassing Adobe's expectations.

The growth accelerated compared to the previous year, particularly in electronics, smartwatches, TVs, and audio equipment.

Elsewhere, Salesforce (NYSE: ) noted a 1% YoY increase in Thanksgiving online sales globally and a 9% YoY rise in Black Friday online sales in the U.S. and 8% globally, exceeding expectations.

Shopify (NYSE: )'s global merchants experienced a record Black Friday with a 22% YoY increase in sales, led by clothing, personal care, and jewelry.

Mastercard (NYSE: ) SpendingPulse data indicates an 8.5% YoY growth in US eCommerce sales for Black Friday, while in-store sales grew by 1.1% YoY.

“Based on data collected up to mid-day on Cyber Monday, we observe that Cyber Week online sales grew solidly YoY and came in better than feared vs. initial expectations,” the analysts said.

Along these lines, the analysts highlighted Amazon (NASDAQ: ) as the key e-commerce stock to own and the “preferred way for investors to be exposed to the sector in volatile times.”

During this year's Cyber weekend, Amazon not only provided substantial discounts on its marketplace but also premiered its inaugural NFL Black Friday game on Prime Video.

The game was accessible to all users with an Amazon login and featured integrated shoppable ads with QR codes at the bottom of the screen, directing viewers to Amazon's Black Friday deals.

“We view this new format not only as a potential driver of topline growth during the holidays but also as tailwind for Prime Membership sign-ups, new advertiser growth as well as overall engagement on the platform (potentially muting some of the headwinds seen over the past months from the rise of competing live streaming platforms),” the analysts wrote.

As far as the digital advertising sector is concerned, the analysts flagged Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Pinterest (NYSE: ).

These three companies are ”best positioned to benefit from key themes around this holiday season including a) continued strength in the retail vertical with early signs of a year-end budget flush; b) higher than average promotional levels and a heightened competitive intensity incl. from Asian based eCommerce companies, and c) ad budgets moving further down the funnel & closer to the transaction, amidst overall better than expected Cyber Week online sales growth.”"

Investors are now turning their attention to a fresh batch of earnings reports expected from several tech and enterprise firms, including Intuit (NASDAQ: ), Workday (NASDAQ: ), Splunk (NASDAQ: ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: ), NetApp (NASDAQ: ), and PDD Holdings.

In the cybersecurity sector, Zscaler (NASDAQ: )'s shares fell 6.6% in premarket trading despite the company reporting strong first-quarter results. The drop comes as Zscaler maintained its fiscal-year billings forecast in the range of $2.52 to $2.56 billion, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Similarly, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: )'s stock experienced a 1.1% decline ahead of its own earnings announcement.

In other market news, Boeing (NYSE: ) received a boost from RBC Capital, which rated the aerospace giant as 'Outperform' and raised its price target to $275, citing positive projections for 2024. Boeing's stock responded favorably, climbing 1.7%.

Meanwhile, Acelyrin saw its shares tumble by 8.2% in after-hours trading. The biotech firm encountered a setback due to a programming error in their izokibep clinical trial for psoriatic arthritis, which was attributed to a vendor oversight.

Despite facing scrutiny from the European Commission over competitive concerns, iRobot (NASDAQ: )'s premarket shares saw an uptick of 1.8%. This increase comes as a silver lining following the company's significant loss on Monday, as it navigates the complex regulatory landscape of its acquisition proposal by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

Axiom Space and AWS are also collaborating on the development and demonstration of in-space cybersecurity solutions that set the foundation for operating a cybersecure Axiom Station, they said in a statement late on Monday.

“We remain excited to collaborate with AWS on advancing the state of the art of cloud infrastructure on-orbit as we build a multi-cloud and multi-user environment for our future space station customers,” said Christian Maender, EVP of Space Commercialization for Axiom Space.

The construction of the Axiom Station, the world’s first commercial space station, is underway. Axiom Space is preparing for a 2026 launch of the first section of its next-generation platform that will operate in low-Earth orbit.

Axiom Space and AWS worked together to integrate and operate an AWS Snowcone device on the International Space Station as part of the Axiom Mission 1 (Ax-1) in April 2022.

“Axiom Space is using AWS’s global infrastructure and a broad and deep portfolio of cloud services to deliver revolutionary solutions to the space industry,” said Dave Levy, AWS vice president, worldwide public sector.

“We are proud to support Axiom Space’s vision to incorporate advanced cloud-based technology into future missions supporting on-orbit research, scientific discovery, and space exploration,” he added.

Axiom Space operates end-to-end missions to the International Space Station while developing its successor, Axiom Station.

Following the news iRobot shares plunged more than 17% today.

The $1.4 billion deal, announced by Amazon in August last year, came as large tech companies face increasing scrutiny for acquiring smaller competitors and accumulating extensive data, potentially enhancing their market dominance or aiding their expansion into new areas.

The European Commission expressed concerns that Amazon might use its position to disadvantage iRobot's competitors. They highlighted potential strategies that Amazon could employ to restrict these rivals from selling their robot vacuum cleaners (RVCs) on Amazon's online marketplace or to degrade their access to it.

The Commission noted the significance of Amazon's online marketplace as a sales channel for RVCs in countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

Amazon received a formal statement of objections from the EU competition enforcer, outlining these concerns. Amazon indicated its cooperation with the Commission to address the concerns. Amazon believes that with its resources, it can accelerate iRobot's innovation, invest in essential features, and reduce prices for consumers.

Amazon has the option to request a closed-door hearing to present its case. The Commission is expected to make its decision by Feb 14, as per Reuters' report from the previous week, which anticipated that the deal would likely receive unconditional clearance."

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Amazon is now the biggest delivery business in the U.S. - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-is-now-the-biggest-delivery-business-in-the-us--wsj-432SI-3915303,"According to The Wall Street Journal, which cited internal Amazon (NASDAQ: ) data and sources familiar with the matter, Amazon (AMZN) has surpassed both UPS (UPS) and FedEx (NYSE: ) to become the largest delivery business in the U.S. in terms of parcel volumes.

In 2022, Amazon delivered more packages in the U.S. than UPS and had already eclipsed FedEx in 2020. Before Thanksgiving in 2022, Amazon had already delivered over 4.8 billion packages in the U.S., and its internal projections predicted that it would deliver around 5.9B by the end of the year. In comparison, UPS said its domestic volume for that period was unlikely to exceed its previous year's total of 5.3B, and FedEx's domestic Express and Ground parcel volume for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2022, was around 3.05B.

Although Amazon has outperformed both companies in terms of residential deliveries, it hasn't matched their worldwide reach or comprehensive service offerings. Analysts at JPMorgan pointed out that Amazon excels in its one-way delivery network, ensuring quick delivery of goods. However, the company still lacks the extensive pick-up and delivery network that its competitors possess.

In 2018, Amazon launched a significant initiative to build its logistics network. The company introduced a program allowing entrepreneurs to start their own delivery franchises for Amazon packages for as low as $10,000. This model, similar to FedEx’s Ground unit, uses contractors for local routes. Amazon significantly expanded its logistics capabilities, including a network of around 200,000 drivers in the U.S., which helped to rapidly scale up the number of packages it could deliver daily.

Furthermore, early in the pandemic, Amazon seized the opportunity to further expand its e-commerce and logistics operations. The company opened hundreds of new warehouses, sorting centers, and other logistics facilities, nearly doubling the size of its network between the start of the pandemic and late 2021."

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Marvell AI business to offset near-term 5G/enterprise weakness - JP Morgan,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/marvell-ai-business-to-offset-nearterm-5genterprise-weakness--jp-morgan-432SI-3914857,"Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 30th. Analysts, on average, are looking for EPS of $0.40 and revenue of $1.4 billion, down 30% and 9%, respectively, from last year. Analysts at JP Morgan see results in line with the consensus and expect ""flattish"" revenue guidance for the January quarter, which would be below the consensus, as stronger AI revenues are offset by weaker service provider/enterprise segments.

Marvell's market landscape shows varied trends, with some sectors like enterprise, 5G networking, and industrial facing gradual declines, analysts note. However, they anticipate a balancing effect due to the robust performance in its cloud networking division. This is propelled by substantial orders in the 800G PAM4 realm from significant players like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). For instance, Nvidia's networking arm has witnessed a staggering 2.8-fold growth in the last two quarters. Additionally, Marvell seems poised for an upward trajectory with the initiation of its initial custom AI ASIC program, which analysts speculate involves collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

While analysts expect weaker near-term 5G and enterprise spending trends, they believe CY24 revenue/EPS forecasts ""are still easily achievable."" This relates to the AI optical/ASIC revenue pipeline for CY24 coming in $300-$400 million higher than previously expected on the ""continued strong upside from PAM4 DSP (800G 1H, 1.6T ramp 2H) and ramp of the team’s first two AI ASIC programs in compute.""

""The team continues to drive 80%+ share in the PAM4 DSP optical chipset market and will benefit from the AI-driven demand for 800Gbps optical connectivity (2:1 ratio on PAM4 DSP chipsets : GPUs/TPUs) and the team is set to start to ramp its 1.6Tbps PAM4 DSP in the 2H to both NVIDIA and Google to support next-generation 3nm AI processor ramps,"" analysts commented.

Overall, JP Morgan reaffirmed an Overweight rating and a $70 price target for Marvell. Analysts perceive the current challenges faced in the 5G/enterprise domains as primarily cyclical or short-term in nature. Meanwhile, they see the company persisting in its execution of long-term growth strategies, poised to generate growth rates surpassing the industry in the mid- to longer-term horizon."
2022-11-27, Investing.com,Salesforce and AWS Expand Partnership,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/salesforce-and-aws-expand-partnership-432SI-3914825,"At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (AMZN), and Salesforce, the #1 AI CRM (CRM), today announced a significant expansion of their long standing, global strategic partnership, deepening product integrations across data and artificial intelligence (AI), and for the first time offering select Salesforce products on the AWS Marketplace.

AWS instances with GH200 NVL32 will be the first AI infrastructure on AWS to feature liquid cooling to help ensure densely-packed server racks can efficiently operate at maximum performance.

EC2 instances with GH200 NVL32 will also benefit from the AWS Nitro System, the underlying infrastructure for next-generation EC2 instances. The Nitro System offloads I/O for functions from the host CPU/GPU to specialized hardware to deliver more consistent performance, while its enhanced security protects customer code and data during processing.

AWS First to Host NVIDIA DGX Cloud Powered by Grace Hopper

AWS will team up with NVIDIA to host NVIDIA DGX Cloud powered by GH200 NVL32 NVLink infrastructure. NVIDIA DGX Cloud is an AI supercomputing service that gives enterprises fast access to multi-node supercomputing for training the most complex LLM and generative AI models, with integrated NVIDIA AI Enterprise software and direct access to NVIDIA AI experts.

Massive Project Ceiba Supercomputer to Supercharge NVIDIA’s AI Development

The Project Ceiba supercomputer that AWS and NVIDIA are collaborating on will be integrated with AWS services, such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) encrypted networking and Amazon Elastic Block Store high-performance block storage, giving NVIDIA access to a comprehensive set of AWS capabilities.

NVIDIA will use the supercomputer for research and development to advance AI for LLMs, graphics (image/video/3D generation) and simulation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, Earth-2 climate prediction, and more.

NVIDIA and AWS Supercharge Generative AI, HPC, Design, and Simulation

To power the development, training, and inference of the largest LLMs, AWS P5e instances will feature NVIDIA’s latest H200 GPUs that offer 141 GB of HBM3e GPU memory, which is 1.8x larger and 1.4x faster than H100 GPUs. This boost in GPU memory, along with up to 3,200 Gbps of EFA networking enabled by the AWS Nitro System, will enable customers to continue to build, train and deploy their cutting-edge models on AWS.

To deliver cost-effective, energy-efficient solutions for video, AI, and graphics workloads, AWS announced new Amazon EC2 G6e instances featuring NVIDIA L40S GPUs and G6 instances powered by L4 GPUs. The new offerings can help startups, enterprises, and researchers meet their AI and high-fidelity graphics needs.

G6e instances are built to handle complex workloads such as generative AI and digital twin applications. Using NVIDIA Omniverse, photorealistic 3D simulations can be developed, contextualized, and enhanced using real-time data from services such as AWS IoT TwinMaker, intelligent chatbots, assistants, search, and summarization. Amazon Robotics and Amazon Fulfillment Centers will be able to integrate digital twins built with NVIDIA Omniverse and AWS IoT TwinMaker to optimize warehouse design and flow, train more intelligent robot assistants, and improve deliveries to customers.

L40S GPUs deliver up to 1.45 petaflops of FP8 performance and feature Ray Tracing cores that offer up to 209 teraflops of ray-tracing performance. L4 GPUs featured in G6 instances will deliver a lower-cost, energy-efficient solution for deploying AI models for natural language processing, language translation, AI video and image analysis, speech recognition, and personalization. L40S GPUs also accelerate graphics workloads, such as creating and rendering real-time, cinematic-quality graphics and game streaming. All three instances are planned to available in the coming year.

NVIDIA Software on AWS Boosts Generative AI Development

In addition, NVIDIA announced software on AWS to boost generative AI development. NVIDIA NeMo Retriever microservice offers new tools to create highly accurate chatbots and summarization tools using accelerated semantic retrieval. NVIDIA BioNeMo, available on Amazon SageMaker now and planned to be offered on AWS on NVIDIA DGX Cloud, enables pharmaceutical companies to speed drug discovery by simplifying and accelerating the training of models using their own data.

NVIDIA software on AWS is helping Amazon bring new innovations to its services and operations. AWS is using the NVIDIA NeMo framework to train select next-generation Amazon Titan LLMs. Amazon Robotics has begun leveraging NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac to build digital twins for automating, optimizing, and planning its autonomous warehouses in virtual environments before deploying them into the real world."

2022-11-28, Investing.com,Cisco Systems Launches New Business Performance Insight and Visibility for Modern Applications on AWS ,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/cisco-systems-launches-new-business-performance-insight-and-visibility-for-modern-applications-on-aws-432SI-3916660,"Cisco (CSCO) today announced new business metrics in Cisco Cloud Observability. Powered by the Cisco Observability Platform to enhance business context for modern applications running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This latest release also supports integration with AWS services and application performance monitoring (APM) correlation and provides end-to-end visibility into the performance of cloud native applications.

Traditional application monitoring tools only provide visibility of application and infrastructure performance metrics. This leaves teams— including ITOps, DevOps and SREs— managing modern applications without clear sight into the relationship between application performance and critical business KPIs such as customer conversion rates and real-time impact on business revenue.

As a result, these teams are unable to make prioritizations based on business impact.

Cisco's latest innovations in full-stack observability deliver teams with the enhanced business context they need to manage modern applications and protect revenue, customer experiences and brand reputation, bridging the gap between business goals and IT.

This new capability empowers users with:

Support for multiple business metrics within a business transaction.

Easy identification of business transactions configured with business metrics for troubleshooting.

User-friendly configuration interface that enables users to preview business transaction attributes for accuracy and set up mission-critical metric alerts.

Advanced KPI visualization including baseline performance and a historical analysis trend line, to easily identify when business performance is abnormal.

Data segmentation by selected attribute values for quick visibility of customer segments being affected most.

For Cisco customers such as Royal Caribbean, these insights are critical. ""With Cisco Full-Stack Observability, we've gone from reactive to proactive. Cisco Cloud Observability will allow us to visualize and correlate metrics, events, logging, and tracing (MELT) data so we can identify, triage, and troubleshoot problems at an even greater velocity,"" said Alice McElroy , Director, IT Operational Excellence, Royal Caribbean.

Supporting integration with more AWS services, DevOps teams can also now observe AWS Lambda functions as an entity within Cisco Cloud Observability APM pages, helping them to understand the functions' contribution to an application, correlate their performance to overall user experience and quickly troubleshoot unexpected behavior.

""By elevating business metrics to first-class status, similar to other performance-related metrics, we enable organizations to mature their observability practice by empowering technical teams to prioritize technical issues that are aligned with business outcomes,"" said Ronak Desai , Senior Vice President and General Manager for Cisco AppDynamics and Full-Stack Observability.

Cisco also announced support for 10 additional AWS services that are now pre-integrated with Cisco Cloud Observability. By tying together applications, business transactions, business metrics and expanded support for AWS infrastructure services, application owners can gain deep cross-domain visibility across the full stack.

Business metrics for Cisco Cloud Observability is now available. For more information, register for our upcoming webinar here .

2022-11-28, Investing.com,Amazon announces ,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-announces-record-black-friday-cyber-monday-event-amid-deep-discounts-3916548,"Investing.com -- Amazon's extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday promotional drive this year was its largest ever, the e-commerce giant announced on Tuesday, as the company rolled out deeper discounts to entice price-conscious consumers.

On a global basis, customers ordered more than a billion items on Amazon (NASDAQ: ) during the sales event, which lasted from Nov. 17 through Nov. 27.

The company noted that demand was particularly high for products like skin treatments, video doorbells, carpet cleaners, and recent movie titles such as ""Barbie"" and ""Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One"" on its Prime Video service. It was also boosted by the National Football League's inaugural Black Friday game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, which was streamed on Prime Video.

In a statement, Amazon said that shoppers saved almost 70% more on its platform compared to the same 11-day period last year, although it did not state how much was spent in total on the website during that time.

The announcement comes as media reports suggest that spending by U.S. consumers is expected to have surged to a record high of over $12 billion on Cyber Monday, while American retail sales both online and in stores on Black Friday grew by 2.5% annually.

Helping to push up expenditures this year has been a move by retailers to slash prices and roll out ""buy now, pay later"" short-term financing schemes in order to persuade inflation-squeezed consumers to open up their wallets.

Analysts at Wedbush noted that much of the spending activity has not been on big-ticket items like electronics and appliances, echoing recent outlooks for the key holiday shopping season from several U.S. retailers. As a result, the Wedbush analysts flagged ""modest risk"" to sales forecasts for the holidays and ""incremental"" pressures from the heavy promotions.

""It is still too early to determine whether retail sales will be as strong as forecasted for this full holiday season, especially given a volatile consumer and competitive environment,"" the Wedbush analysts said.

However, they argued that Amazon and other companies with strong online offerings and a ""best-in-class"" fulfillment service are well-positioned to ""finish the year on a strong note."""

2022-11-28, Investing.com,These 4 internet stocks are best positioned to benefit from this holiday season - GS,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/these-4-internet-stocks-are-best-positioned-to-benefit-from-this-holiday-season--gs-432SI-3916256,"Goldman Sachs tech analysts weighed in on this year’s holiday season and shared their key takeaways from Black Friday and Cyber Monday promotional campaigns.

Adobe (NASDAQ: ) reported record-breaking U.S. online sales during Thanksgiving, increasing by 5.5% YoY and matching Adobe's forecast. Black Friday saw a YoY growth of 7.5%, surpassing Adobe's expectations.

The growth accelerated compared to the previous year, particularly in electronics, smartwatches, TVs, and audio equipment.

Elsewhere, Salesforce (NYSE: ) noted a 1% YoY increase in Thanksgiving online sales globally and a 9% YoY rise in Black Friday online sales in the U.S. and 8% globally, exceeding expectations.

Shopify (NYSE: )'s global merchants experienced a record Black Friday with a 22% YoY increase in sales, led by clothing, personal care, and jewelry.

Mastercard (NYSE: ) SpendingPulse data indicates an 8.5% YoY growth in US eCommerce sales for Black Friday, while in-store sales grew by 1.1% YoY.

“Based on data collected up to mid-day on Cyber Monday, we observe that Cyber Week online sales grew solidly YoY and came in better than feared vs. initial expectations,” the analysts said.

Along these lines, the analysts highlighted Amazon (NASDAQ: ) as the key e-commerce stock to own and the “preferred way for investors to be exposed to the sector in volatile times.”

During this year's Cyber weekend, Amazon not only provided substantial discounts on its marketplace but also premiered its inaugural NFL Black Friday game on Prime Video.

The game was accessible to all users with an Amazon login and featured integrated shoppable ads with QR codes at the bottom of the screen, directing viewers to Amazon's Black Friday deals.

“We view this new format not only as a potential driver of topline growth during the holidays but also as tailwind for Prime Membership sign-ups, new advertiser growth as well as overall engagement on the platform (potentially muting some of the headwinds seen over the past months from the rise of competing live streaming platforms),” the analysts wrote.

As far as the digital advertising sector is concerned, the analysts flagged Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Pinterest (NYSE: ).

These three companies are ”best positioned to benefit from key themes around this holiday season including a) continued strength in the retail vertical with early signs of a year-end budget flush; b) higher than average promotional levels and a heightened competitive intensity incl. from Asian based eCommerce companies, and c) ad budgets moving further down the funnel & closer to the transaction, amidst overall better than expected Cyber Week online sales growth.”"

Investors are now turning their attention to a fresh batch of earnings reports expected from several tech and enterprise firms, including Intuit (NASDAQ: ), Workday (NASDAQ: ), Splunk (NASDAQ: ), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: ), NetApp (NASDAQ: ), and PDD Holdings.

In the cybersecurity sector, Zscaler (NASDAQ: )'s shares fell 6.6% in premarket trading despite the company reporting strong first-quarter results. The drop comes as Zscaler maintained its fiscal-year billings forecast in the range of $2.52 to $2.56 billion, potentially dampening investor enthusiasm. Similarly, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: )'s stock experienced a 1.1% decline ahead of its own earnings announcement.

In other market news, Boeing (NYSE: ) received a boost from RBC Capital, which rated the aerospace giant as 'Outperform' and raised its price target to $275, citing positive projections for 2024. Boeing's stock responded favorably, climbing 1.7%.

Meanwhile, Acelyrin saw its shares tumble by 8.2% in after-hours trading. The biotech firm encountered a setback due to a programming error in their izokibep clinical trial for psoriatic arthritis, which was attributed to a vendor oversight.

Despite facing scrutiny from the European Commission over competitive concerns, iRobot (NASDAQ: )'s premarket shares saw an uptick of 1.8%. This increase comes as a silver lining following the company's significant loss on Monday, as it navigates the complex regulatory landscape of its acquisition proposal by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

Following the news iRobot shares plunged more than 17% today.

The $1.4 billion deal, announced by Amazon in August last year, came as large tech companies face increasing scrutiny for acquiring smaller competitors and accumulating extensive data, potentially enhancing their market dominance or aiding their expansion into new areas.

The European Commission expressed concerns that Amazon might use its position to disadvantage iRobot's competitors. They highlighted potential strategies that Amazon could employ to restrict these rivals from selling their robot vacuum cleaners (RVCs) on Amazon's online marketplace or to degrade their access to it.

The Commission noted the significance of Amazon's online marketplace as a sales channel for RVCs in countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.

Amazon received a formal statement of objections from the EU competition enforcer, outlining these concerns. Amazon indicated its cooperation with the Commission to address the concerns. Amazon believes that with its resources, it can accelerate iRobot's innovation, invest in essential features, and reduce prices for consumers.

Amazon has the option to request a closed-door hearing to present its case. The Commission is expected to make its decision by Feb 14, as per Reuters' report from the previous week, which anticipated that the deal would likely receive unconditional clearance."

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Amazon is now the biggest delivery business in the U.S. - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-is-now-the-biggest-delivery-business-in-the-us--wsj-432SI-3915303,"According to The Wall Street Journal, which cited internal Amazon (NASDAQ: ) data and sources familiar with the matter, Amazon (AMZN) has surpassed both UPS (UPS) and FedEx (NYSE: ) to become the largest delivery business in the U.S. in terms of parcel volumes.

In 2022, Amazon delivered more packages in the U.S. than UPS and had already eclipsed FedEx in 2020. Before Thanksgiving in 2022, Amazon had already delivered over 4.8 billion packages in the U.S., and its internal projections predicted that it would deliver around 5.9B by the end of the year. In comparison, UPS said its domestic volume for that period was unlikely to exceed its previous year's total of 5.3B, and FedEx's domestic Express and Ground parcel volume for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2022, was around 3.05B.

Although Amazon has outperformed both companies in terms of residential deliveries, it hasn't matched their worldwide reach or comprehensive service offerings. Analysts at JPMorgan pointed out that Amazon excels in its one-way delivery network, ensuring quick delivery of goods. However, the company still lacks the extensive pick-up and delivery network that its competitors possess.

In 2018, Amazon launched a significant initiative to build its logistics network. The company introduced a program allowing entrepreneurs to start their own delivery franchises for Amazon packages for as low as $10,000. This model, similar to FedEx’s Ground unit, uses contractors for local routes. Amazon significantly expanded its logistics capabilities, including a network of around 200,000 drivers in the U.S., which helped to rapidly scale up the number of packages it could deliver daily.

Furthermore, early in the pandemic, Amazon seized the opportunity to further expand its e-commerce and logistics operations. The company opened hundreds of new warehouses, sorting centers, and other logistics facilities, nearly doubling the size of its network between the start of the pandemic and late 2021."

2022-11-27, Investing.com,IBM Collaborates with AWS to Launch a New Cloud Database Offering,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/ibm-collaborates-with-aws-to-launch-a-new-cloud-database-offering-432SI-3915265,"IBM (IBM) announced today at AWS re:Invent 2022 that it has been working with Amazon Web Services (AWS) on the general availability of Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for Db2, a fully managed cloud offering designed to make it easier for database customers to manage data for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads across hybrid cloud environments.

Businesses are turning to AI to unlock insights that can lead to more informed decisions, automation of repetitive tasks, and greater efficiencies. These AI technologies are powered by massive amounts of data that require modern data stores residing on cloud-native architectures to provide scalability, cost optimization, enhanced performance, and business continuity.

Amazon RDS for Db2 customers now have the option to modernize on premises, on AWS, or to deploy a hybrid cloud architecture, to optimize AI workloads. For customers moving to AWS, Amazon RDS for Db2 can help them to migrate their existing, self-managed Db2 databases to the cloud — helping to automate time consuming database administrative tasks such as provisioning, backups, software patching, and monitoring.

""Digital transformation is a strategic imperative for nearly every one of our clients. By working with AWS to bring Db2 to Amazon RDS, we're helping companies prepare for the next generation of applications, analytics, and AI workloads that will power the modern economy,"" said Dinesh Nirmal , Senior Vice President of Products, IBM Software. ""IBM and AWS are redefining the possibilities of cloud database innovation, removing the complexity of modernization and empowering organizations to realize the full potential of their data.""

Amazon RDS customers have seen significant business value by moving to a fully managed service. Results of an AWS and IDC study of RDS users found study participants who moved to a managed database on Amazon RDS were able to manage on average up to 60% 1 more databases per DBA and estimated an average of 39% 1 lower database operational costs over three years – enabling DBAs to focus on high value work like application modernization or query optimization.

""We are pleased to collaborate with IBM to make it easier for customers to manage and modernize the highly-regarded and trusted IBM Db2 database in the cloud,"" said Jeff Carter , VP Databases & Migrations, AWS. ""For over a decade, Amazon RDS has offered hundreds of thousands of customers proven operational expertise, security best practices, and best-in-class managed database services for their mission-critical workloads. With Amazon RDS for Db2, customers can offload time-consuming database administrative tasks, such as provisioning, backups, patching, and monitoring, and use Amazon RDS multi-AZ deployments for high availability and durability. Customers can also easily take advantage of the broad portfolio of AWS services, including ability to accelerate their generative AI priorities.""

Amazon RDS for Db2 combines the operational expertise and ease of use of Amazon RDS to automate database administration with IBM Db2's decades of experience running mission critical workloads for some of the largest banks, supply chain operations, and retail/e-commerce businesses in the world. Many long-time customers who participated in the private beta already see the value of this offering and are looking forward to accelerating productivity and modernization initiatives.

""The IT leaders at our cross-industry clients see this as a compelling value proposition,"" said Frank Fillmore , owner of The Fillmore Group, an IBM business partner that participated in the beta. ""Amazon RDS for Db2 brings together the foundational expertise of IBM in relational database technology and the cloud innovations of AWS to help deliver the best of deployment efficiency, elastic scaling, and cost savings.""

As Amazon RDS for Db2 customers accelerate their modernization and AI initiatives, they will be able to leverage an array of IBM's integrated data and AI capabilities on AWS to manage data and scale AI workloads. This includes IBM's entire portfolio of commercial databases, data fabric solutions, and watsonx data, AI, and select AI governance capabilities — all of which can help customers build, scale, and run the next generation of trusted AI applications. Amazon RDS for Db2 customers will now be able to unify, transform and share transactional data for AI, using Amazon RDS for Db2's native integrations with Db2 Warehouse and watsonx.data open data lakehouse on AWS.

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Salesforce to offer products on AWS Marketplace for the first time,https://in.investing.com/news/salesforce-to-offer-products-on-aws-marketplace-for-the-first-time-3914957,"Investing.com -- Amazon Web Services will begin to offer select products from Salesforce (NYSE: ) on its marketplace service for the first time, the companies announced in a joint statement on Monday, as they look to expand their partnership across data and artificial intelligence.

AWS, the key cloud division of e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ), lets businesses sell their software on its AWS Marketplace function. AWS then takes a cut from sales of the product made on the platform.

The agreement will allow cloud service provider Salesforce to streamline purchasing options of several of its products on AWS Marketplace, including its popular customer relationship management and support requests applications. Slack, Salesforce's work messaging app, was not mentioned in the announcement.

Customers will also be to ""seamlessly unite"" their AWS data into Salesforce's offerings and ""infuse"" their workflows with generative AI tools, the groups said.

""With this expanded partnership, our joint customers gain powerful new ways to innovate, collaborate, and build more customer-focused applications using the broadest and deepest set of cloud services,” said AWS Chief Executive Adam Selipsky in a statement."
2022-11-27, Investing.com,Marvell AI business to offset near-term 5G/enterprise weakness - JP Morgan,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/marvell-ai-business-to-offset-nearterm-5genterprise-weakness--jp-morgan-432SI-3914857,"Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 30th. Analysts, on average, are looking for EPS of $0.40 and revenue of $1.4 billion, down 30% and 9%, respectively, from last year. Analysts at JP Morgan see results in line with the consensus and expect ""flattish"" revenue guidance for the January quarter, which would be below the consensus, as stronger AI revenues are offset by weaker service provider/enterprise segments.

Marvell's market landscape shows varied trends, with some sectors like enterprise, 5G networking, and industrial facing gradual declines, analysts note. However, they anticipate a balancing effect due to the robust performance in its cloud networking division. This is propelled by substantial orders in the 800G PAM4 realm from significant players like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). For instance, Nvidia's networking arm has witnessed a staggering 2.8-fold growth in the last two quarters. Additionally, Marvell seems poised for an upward trajectory with the initiation of its initial custom AI ASIC program, which analysts speculate involves collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

While analysts expect weaker near-term 5G and enterprise spending trends, they believe CY24 revenue/EPS forecasts ""are still easily achievable."" This relates to the AI optical/ASIC revenue pipeline for CY24 coming in $300-$400 million higher than previously expected on the ""continued strong upside from PAM4 DSP (800G 1H, 1.6T ramp 2H) and ramp of the team’s first two AI ASIC programs in compute.""

""The team continues to drive 80%+ share in the PAM4 DSP optical chipset market and will benefit from the AI-driven demand for 800Gbps optical connectivity (2:1 ratio on PAM4 DSP chipsets : GPUs/TPUs) and the team is set to start to ramp its 1.6Tbps PAM4 DSP in the 2H to both NVIDIA and Google to support next-generation 3nm AI processor ramps,"" analysts commented.

Overall, JP Morgan reaffirmed an Overweight rating and a $70 price target for Marvell. Analysts perceive the current challenges faced in the 5G/enterprise domains as primarily cyclical or short-term in nature. Meanwhile, they see the company persisting in its execution of long-term growth strategies, poised to generate growth rates surpassing the industry in the mid- to longer-term horizon."
2022-11-27, Investing.com,Salesforce and AWS Expand Partnership,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/salesforce-and-aws-expand-partnership-432SI-3914825,"At AWS re:Invent, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (AMZN), and Salesforce, the #1 AI CRM (CRM), today announced a significant expansion of their long standing, global strategic partnership, deepening product integrations across data and artificial intelligence (AI), and for the first time offering select Salesforce products on the AWS Marketplace. The expanded agreement makes it easier for customers to seamlessly and securely manage their data across Salesforce and AWS, and safely and responsibly infuse the latest generative AI technologies into their applications and workflows.

To make it easier for customers to benefit from the combined value of Salesforce and AWS, the companies will deepen the integrations between their industry-leading products. Salesforce will now support Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies available through a single application programming interface (API), as part of Salesforce’s open model ecosystem strategy. This will make Amazon Bedrock available through the Einstein Trust Layer, powering AI-driven apps and workflows in Salesforce. In addition, Salesforce Data Cloud will expand to support data sharing across additional AWS technologies. These Data Cloud integrations will be governed by new centralized access controls, giving customers the ability to manage secure user access at the folder, object, and file level for Data Cloud content stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

As part of this partnership, Salesforce will expand its use of AWS, including compute, storage, data, and AI technologies through Hyperforce to further enhance popular services like Salesforce Data Cloud. AWS will also expand its use of Salesforce products such as Salesforce Data Cloud. Data Cloud will allow AWS to create a single unified customer profile allowing them to deliver more personalized experiences to customers.

These new and enhanced integrations will include:

Streamlining Purchasing Options for Customers in the AWS Marketplace: For the first time, Salesforce will begin offering its products, including Data Cloud , Service Cloud , Sales Cloud , Industry Clouds , Tableau , MuleSoft , Platform , and Heroku , on the AWS Marketplace , making it even easier for AWS customers to subscribe to and manage Salesforce offerings. Customers will benefit from a single view across their IT spend, simplified procurement processes, and flexible options like private pricing and consolidated billing through AWS, providing a seamless way to leverage pre-approved budgets and increase business performance. Joint customers in the U.S. may now purchase select Salesforce products through AWS Marketplace , with expanded product and regional support planned for 2024.

Enhancing Customer Experiences Through Unified Data Management: AWS and Salesforce are making Data Cloud a comprehensive, flexible, and secure Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) data platform for their customers. New Zero-ETL (extract, transform, and load) integrations reduce the need for customers to build their own ETL pipelines between Data Cloud and AWS data services. As a result, customers can easily and seamlessly unite all of their data to support improved and faster insights, predictions, and more powerful applications. Additionally, customers will be able to securely run their own code for data processing tasks such as complex transformations, calculated insights, data triggers, or user-defined functions with Data Cloud that will be powered by AWS compute services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and AWS Lambda.

Securely Bringing AWS Data and AI Services to Salesforce’s Einstein 1 Platform: Customers will be able to use new solutions like Salesforce Prompt Builder, part of the Einstein Copilot Studio , to create custom prompt templates grounded in their data. Custom prompt templates can be sent to their preferred FMs, which will include leading models hosted on Amazon Bedrock. This will enable customers to securely use techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with models from leading AI companies including AI21 Labs, Amazon, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, and Stability AI. In addition to accessing their own FMs through an integration between Data Cloud and Amazon SageMaker , developers will be able to use simplified tooling to fine-tune FMs on Amazon Bedrock through the Einstein Trust Layer and power generative AI experiences across the Salesforce Customer 360 platform.

Seamless Customer Service with Service Cloud and Amazon Connect: Deepening the Service Cloud Voice and Amazon Connect integration, Salesforce and AWS are bringing Amazon Connect Chat to Service Cloud Digital Engagement and Amazon Connect forecasting, capacity planning, and agent scheduling to enhance the Salesforce Service Cloud Omnichannel supervisor experience. This, together with integrated generative AI capabilities powering unified customer insights and both agent and manager automated assistance, will enable a unified customer experience, more productive agents across channels, and more informed supervisors. This first phase of this deeper integration is planned for release in early 2024.

Empowering Developers with New AWS Compute and Development Services: Salesforce is working with AWS to reimagine Heroku as the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) layer (available in the first half of 2024) for development of AI-first apps across Salesforce and AWS. Heroku will fortify its Dyno compute functionality by using the most powerful and cost-effective infrastructure from AWS, including accelerated Amazon EC2 instances powered by Nvidia GPUs, AWS Trainium, and AWS Inferentia for machine learning (ML) training and inference, along with additional GPU-optimized EC2 instances for graphics-intensive applications. They will also use AWS Graviton-based EC2 instances for the best price-performance compute. This will provide Heroku customers with the most performant, cost-effective infrastructure across resource-heavy workloads such as development with FMs. In addition, Heroku will help customers build applications faster and more securely with Amazon CodeWhisperer. Salesforce developers will also be able to use Einstein Copilot Studio to create custom actions that Einstein Copilot can invoke, which range from workflows in Salesforce to services hosted on AWS, creating a new AI-first pattern for cross-platform process automation.

“Today’s announcement is an incredible milestone in the evolution of our longstanding partnership with AWS,” said Marc Benioff, chair and CEO, Salesforce. “We’re bringing together the #No. 1 AI CRM provider and the leading cloud provider to deliver a trusted, open, integrated data and AI platform, and ensuring we meet massive customer demand for our products on the AWS Marketplace. With these enhancements to our partnership, we’re enabling all of our customers to be more innovative, productive and successful in this new AI era.”

“Salesforce and AWS make it easy for developers to securely access and leverage data and generative AI technologies to drive rapid transformation for their organizations and industries,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO, AWS. “With this expanded partnership, our joint customers gain powerful new ways to innovate, collaborate, and build more customer-focused applications using the broadest and deepest set of cloud services.”

Customers benefiting from the expanded relationship between AWS and Salesforce include:

“As an industry leading insurance company, State FarmⓇ has teamed up with both AWS and Salesforce for years, and each collaboration has yielded tremendous value for our teams and the customers we serve,” said Fawad Ahmad, Senior Vice President and Chief Digital Officer, State Farm. “As these two leading companies expand their partnership even further, we anticipate unlocking even more value for the 94 million policies & accounts State Farm serves today.”

The new product integrations will be available in 2024.

Joint customers in the U.S. may now purchase select Salesforce products through AWS Marketplace, with expanded product and regional support planned for 2024.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

2022-11-25, IANS,X may lose up to $75 mn of ad revenue as more brands pull out: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-lose-up-to-75-mn-of-ad-revenue-as-more-brands-pull-out-report-3913270,"San Francisco, Nov 25 (IANS) Elon Musk-run X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pull out their marketing campaigns after the tech billionaire endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month, the media reported.According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Musk's support for an antisemitic message on the platform last week prompted numerous firms, including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery, to halt advertising on the X.

X has responded by suing non-profit Media Matters, arguing that the organisation defamed the platform with a report alleging that advertisements for major brands such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ) appeared next to messages praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

According to the report, the documents come from X's sales team and are designed to monitor the effects of all the advertising mishaps that took place this month, including those by companies that have already suspended ads and others that may be at risk of doing so.

The documents detail how much ad revenue X employees worry the company could lose by the end of the year if advertisers do not resume their ads.

However, X claimed in a statement on Friday that $11 million in revenue was at risk, with the actual sum fluctuating as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, a new report has revealed that some super-spreaders of misinformation on X, who are verified premium users with blue badges, are sharing Musk’s ad revenue even after making conspiratorial claims about the Israel-Hamas war.

NewsGuard, a for-profit misinformation watchdog organisation, found that such posts with misinformation reached a collective 92 million views.

2022-11-24, Investing.com,U.S. futures inch up ahead of shortened trading day - what's moving markets,https://in.investing.com/news/us-futures-inch-up-ahead-of-shortened-trading-day--whats-moving-markets-3912414,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures edged into the green ahead of a truncated trading day. American shoppers will be on the hunt for deals this Black Friday as retail companies warn that inflation-squeezed consumers may be more careful about spending big this holiday season. Elsewhere, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers and activists in Europe plan protests and strikes aimed at disrupting the e-commerce giant's massive delivery network during its ongoing ten-day sales event.

1. Futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up prior to a shortened trading day on Wall Street on Friday.

By 04:52 ET (09:52 GMT), the contract had added 63 points or 0.2%, rose by 6 points or 0.1%, and had climbed by 19 points or 0.1%.

Markets in the U.S., which were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, are scheduled to shutter early. In the last full trading day of the week on Wednesday, equities rose thanks in part to economic data which fueled optimism that the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.

Retailers will likely be in the spotlight, as they attempt to persuade customers to open up their wallets for Black Friday, the annual sales spree that typically kicks the crucial holiday shopping season into full gear. But with inflation high and borrowing costs elevated, many of these firms have flagged that American consumers may not be as willing as usual to spend on big-ticket items during the final weeks of the year.

2. S&P Global (NYSE: ) U.S. manufacturing PMIs ahead

The economic calendar in the U.S. is mostly sparse on Friday, save for the release of the November from financial information group S&P Global.

A proxy for economic activity in the world's largest economy, the preliminary figure for this month is expected to have dipped to 49.8, down from 50.0 in October. A mark below 50 indicates contraction.

On Wednesday, new data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment aid fell by more than expected last week. University of Michigan price growth expectations were also revised higher, while durable goods orders in October were softer than projected.

Investors seemed to view the readings as a sign that, while the U.S. economy is easing, it could remain resilient enough to avert a recession. Hopes that the Fed may cease its tightening cycle were subsequently bolstered.

3. Amazon protests in Europe

Amazon workers and activists plan a series of protests across Europe on Friday in an attempt to disrupt the e-commerce giant's logistics network on one of its biggest shopping days of the year.

Employees at Amazon fulfilment centers and warehouses in some the continent's largest countries, including Germany and the U.K., are due to carry out labor actions on Black Friday as part of ongoing wage disputes. An anti-globalization group in France is also calling on demonstrators to place posters and ticker tape on parcel lockers used by Amazon shoppers to collect orders.

The moves are targeting Amazon's vast delivery system during a ten-day discount event that is set to end on November 27. Speaking with Reuters, Amazon spokespeople in Germany and Britain said that deliveries will still be reliable and timely.

4. Japanese inflation accelerates

Core consumer inflation in Japan accelerated for the first time in four months in October, as a debate rages in the country over the potential normalization of the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.

The national core consumer price index, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, grew 2.9% on an annualized basis in October, data from the Statistics Bureau showed on Friday.

The reading was just below expectations of 3%, but was faster than a 2.8% increase seen last month.

While the BOJ has tweaked its ultra-dovish stance in recent months to somewhat address yen weakness and rising bond yields, the bank has provided no clear cues on when it plans to pivot away from the policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank would make no changes until it was convinced that wage growth, which has been subdued for most of the past two years, was picking up.

5. Crude awaits OPEC+ gathering

Oil prices traded in a mixed fashion Friday, but remained on course for the first positive week in five ahead of next week’s OPEC+ meeting to discuss future output levels.

By 04:53 ET, the futures traded 0.6% lower at $76.67 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.2% to $81.59 per barrel. Both contracts were up around 1% for the week, gaining after an extended rout brought prices to near four-month lows.

Traders still expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to agree to more supply cuts to boost prices.

The OPEC+ meeting was delayed to Nov. 30, having originally been scheduled for Sunday, prompting speculation of disagreements between member countries over planned production cuts."

2022-11-23, Investing.com,"OneWeb India gets nod for satellite broadband, awaits spectrum",https://in.investing.com/news/oneweb-india-gets-nod-for-satellite-broadband-awaits-spectrum-93CH-3911504,"OneWeb India has received approval from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) to operate satellite broadband services in the country, marking a significant step towards enhancing internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas. This development comes as part of a broader effort to bridge the digital divide and stimulate economic growth through improved access to online education and healthcare services.

The authorization, pending Department of Telecommunications (DoT) spectrum allocation, positions OneWeb India to launch its services for a five-year term once spectrum rights are granted. The company, backed by Bharti Group's Sunil Bharti Mittal, has stated its readiness to commence operations and aims to provide high-speed, low-latency internet access across India.

OneWeb India's venture is supported by Eutelsat OneWeb, which has bounced back from its November 2020 bankruptcy. The restructured entity boasts a consortium of stakeholders including Bharti Global, Eutelsat, the UK government, and SoftBank (TYO: ), each holding a 12% equity stake. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has already deployed 72 satellites as part of OneWeb's constellation, with plans to achieve complete global coverage by the end of this year.

The company is set to compete with other major players in the Indian telecom sector, such as Mukesh Ambani's Jio Satellite, Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s Project Kuiper, and Starlink. While these competitors also seek operational clearances, they are awaiting a government decision on the framework for spectrum allocation.

Despite the competitive landscape, Sunil Mittal downplayed the threat posed by Jio Satellite in the satcom services market, instead pointing to challenges from international entities like Starlink and Amazon. On the other hand, Mathew Oommen from Jio highlighted their readiness and established infrastructure capable of delivering gigabit-speed broadband-from-space services.

Both OneWeb and Jio are expanding into rural regions where broadband access is limited. OneWeb is preparing its geostationary orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for this purpose. Concurrently, Jio is working with SES Satellites' GEO and medium Earth orbit (MEO) constellation through its partnership.

As the industry anticipates the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to finalize methods for satellite spectrum allocation amidst debates over auction versus administrative assignment, SES’s new O3b mPOWER constellation faces delays unrelated to its Indian market presence or JioSpaceFiber's impending service launch. Despite these technical glitches, JioSpaceFiber's rollout remains on track with access to alternative satellite systems.

In light of these developments, India is poised to secure a significant share of the global space communication market which is estimated to reach $1 trillion by 2030. With ISRO's longstanding contributions to space technology and its focus on services that benefit the common man, India aims for a $40 billion stake in this burgeoning sector by 2040.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway divests from long-held stocks amid market shifts,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-divests-from-longheld-stocks-amid-market-shifts-93CH-3910431,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has made significant changes to its investment portfolio, according to recent SEC filings. The company has completely divested from several long-standing holdings, including General Motors (NYSE:NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE:NYSE: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE: ), amid various economic pressures and strategic shifts.

The move comes as Berkshire's Class A shares have seen a near 4,400,000% gain since Buffett took the helm in the mid-1960s. Investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been active in reshaping the portfolio during the third quarter. The exit from General Motors, held since the first quarter of 2012, was likely influenced by increased labor costs following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union and a downturn in electric vehicle demand as loan rates rise.

Similarly, UPS, part of Berkshire's portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, saw its remaining shares sold due to economic uncertainties and higher labor expenses stemming from new labor contracts. Mondelez International, with popular brands like Oreo and Ritz under its belt since the second quarter of 2007, was dropped amidst consumer resistance to price hikes and concerns over a heavy debt load that echoed issues seen during Kraft Heinz’s writedown incident.

Procter & Gamble, a Berkshire holding since the first quarter of 2005, was released as it faced volume declines and currency headwinds. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson, a staple in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, was sold off due to litigation issues related to talc cancer claims and Buffett’s preference not to closely track drug development catalysts—despite JNJ's strong value proposition indicated by its rare AAA credit rating.

Despite these sell-offs, Apple (NASDAQ: ) remains Berkshire's dominant position even though it experienced a valuation dip. Reduced positions were also noted in other companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), HP Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ), Aon (NYSE:NYSE: ), Markel (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Globe Life (NYSE:NYSE: ).

In contrast to these divestments, Berkshire Hathaway has made new investments including an $8 million interest in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and expanded holdings in Liberty Media with stakes in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Liberty Live Group. In addition to these acquisitions, Berkshire invested a fresh $44 million in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: ). To maintain competitive secrecy, Berkshire has sought confidential treatment for an undisclosed new holding.

With these portfolio adjustments reflecting Buffett's strategic thinking amid current market dynamics, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have soared to a record $157 billion. This substantial cash pile underscores the conglomerate's ability to capitalize on investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns.

Despite continuous losses and minimal revenue, the company stands out for operating without debt and securing a two-year cash runway as of July 2022. With $21 million in reserves, Rafael Holdings has managed to significantly reduce its annual cash burn by 58%, now at $11 million.

The company's ability to slash its cash burn from the previous year showcases a strategic effort to stabilize its financials. However, concerns loom over the company's long-term sustainability due to its limited income, which was reported at $279k last year. The current market capitalization of Rafael Holdings is $45 million, and any fundraising matching its annual cash burn could lead to substantial shareholder dilution—potentially up to 24% of its total market value.

Investors are closely watching Rafael Holdings as it navigates these challenges, with the company's performance evoking memories of Amazon.com's early struggles before it became a market giant.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

2022-11-25, IANS,X may lose up to $75 mn of ad revenue as more brands pull out: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/x-may-lose-up-to-75-mn-of-ad-revenue-as-more-brands-pull-out-report-3913270,"San Francisco, Nov 25 (IANS) Elon Musk-run X could lose as much as $75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pull out their marketing campaigns after the tech billionaire endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month, the media reported.According to the internal documents seen by The New York Times this week, over 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and others have halted or are considering pausing their ads on X.

Musk's support for an antisemitic message on the platform last week prompted numerous firms, including Walt Disney (NYSE: ) and Warner Bros Discovery, to halt advertising on the X.

X has responded by suing non-profit Media Matters, arguing that the organisation defamed the platform with a report alleging that advertisements for major brands such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: ) appeared next to messages praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party.

According to the report, the documents come from X's sales team and are designed to monitor the effects of all the advertising mishaps that took place this month, including those by companies that have already suspended ads and others that may be at risk of doing so.

The documents detail how much ad revenue X employees worry the company could lose by the end of the year if advertisers do not resume their ads.

However, X claimed in a statement on Friday that $11 million in revenue was at risk, with the actual sum fluctuating as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, a new report has revealed that some super-spreaders of misinformation on X, who are verified premium users with blue badges, are sharing Musk’s ad revenue even after making conspiratorial claims about the Israel-Hamas war.

NewsGuard, a for-profit misinformation watchdog organisation, found that such posts with misinformation reached a collective 92 million views.

2022-11-24, Investing.com,U.S. futures inch up ahead of shortened trading day - what's moving markets,https://in.investing.com/news/us-futures-inch-up-ahead-of-shortened-trading-day--whats-moving-markets-3912414,"Investing.com -- U.S. futures edged into the green ahead of a truncated trading day. American shoppers will be on the hunt for deals this Black Friday as retail companies warn that inflation-squeezed consumers may be more careful about spending big this holiday season. Elsewhere, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers and activists in Europe plan protests and strikes aimed at disrupting the e-commerce giant's massive delivery network during its ongoing ten-day sales event.

1. Futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up prior to a shortened trading day on Wall Street on Friday.

By 04:52 ET (09:52 GMT), the contract had added 63 points or 0.2%, rose by 6 points or 0.1%, and had climbed by 19 points or 0.1%.

Markets in the U.S., which were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, are scheduled to shutter early. In the last full trading day of the week on Wednesday, equities rose thanks in part to economic data which fueled optimism that the Federal Reserve's campaign of interest rate hikes may have peaked.

Retailers will likely be in the spotlight, as they attempt to persuade customers to open up their wallets for Black Friday, the annual sales spree that typically kicks the crucial holiday shopping season into full gear. But with inflation high and borrowing costs elevated, many of these firms have flagged that American consumers may not be as willing as usual to spend on big-ticket items during the final weeks of the year.

2. S&P Global (NYSE: ) U.S. manufacturing PMIs ahead

The economic calendar in the U.S. is mostly sparse on Friday, save for the release of the November from financial information group S&P Global.

A proxy for economic activity in the world's largest economy, the preliminary figure for this month is expected to have dipped to 49.8, down from 50.0 in October. A mark below 50 indicates contraction.

On Wednesday, new data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment aid fell by more than expected last week. University of Michigan price growth expectations were also revised higher, while durable goods orders in October were softer than projected.

Investors seemed to view the readings as a sign that, while the U.S. economy is easing, it could remain resilient enough to avert a recession. Hopes that the Fed may cease its tightening cycle were subsequently bolstered.

3. Amazon protests in Europe

Amazon workers and activists plan a series of protests across Europe on Friday in an attempt to disrupt the e-commerce giant's logistics network on one of its biggest shopping days of the year.

Employees at Amazon fulfilment centers and warehouses in some the continent's largest countries, including Germany and the U.K., are due to carry out labor actions on Black Friday as part of ongoing wage disputes. An anti-globalization group in France is also calling on demonstrators to place posters and ticker tape on parcel lockers used by Amazon shoppers to collect orders.

The moves are targeting Amazon's vast delivery system during a ten-day discount event that is set to end on November 27. Speaking with Reuters, Amazon spokespeople in Germany and Britain said that deliveries will still be reliable and timely.

4. Japanese inflation accelerates

Core consumer inflation in Japan accelerated for the first time in four months in October, as a debate rages in the country over the potential normalization of the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy.

The national core consumer price index, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, grew 2.9% on an annualized basis in October, data from the Statistics Bureau showed on Friday.

The reading was just below expectations of 3%, but was faster than a 2.8% increase seen last month.

While the BOJ has tweaked its ultra-dovish stance in recent months to somewhat address yen weakness and rising bond yields, the bank has provided no clear cues on when it plans to pivot away from the policy. Governor Kazuo Ueda said the bank would make no changes until it was convinced that wage growth, which has been subdued for most of the past two years, was picking up.

5. Crude awaits OPEC+ gathering

Oil prices traded in a mixed fashion Friday, but remained on course for the first positive week in five ahead of next week’s OPEC+ meeting to discuss future output levels.

By 04:53 ET, the futures traded 0.6% lower at $76.67 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.2% to $81.59 per barrel. Both contracts were up around 1% for the week, gaining after an extended rout brought prices to near four-month lows.

Traders still expect the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, to agree to more supply cuts to boost prices.

The OPEC+ meeting was delayed to Nov. 30, having originally been scheduled for Sunday, prompting speculation of disagreements between member countries over planned production cuts."

2022-11-23, Investing.com,"OneWeb India gets nod for satellite broadband, awaits spectrum",https://in.investing.com/news/oneweb-india-gets-nod-for-satellite-broadband-awaits-spectrum-93CH-3911504,"OneWeb India has received approval from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Center (IN-SPACe) to operate satellite broadband services in the country, marking a significant step towards enhancing internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas. This development comes as part of a broader effort to bridge the digital divide and stimulate economic growth through improved access to online education and healthcare services.

The authorization, pending Department of Telecommunications (DoT) spectrum allocation, positions OneWeb India to launch its services for a five-year term once spectrum rights are granted. The company, backed by Bharti Group's Sunil Bharti Mittal, has stated its readiness to commence operations and aims to provide high-speed, low-latency internet access across India.

OneWeb India's venture is supported by Eutelsat OneWeb, which has bounced back from its November 2020 bankruptcy. The restructured entity boasts a consortium of stakeholders including Bharti Global, Eutelsat, the UK government, and SoftBank (TYO: ), each holding a 12% equity stake. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has already deployed 72 satellites as part of OneWeb's constellation, with plans to achieve complete global coverage by the end of this year.

The company is set to compete with other major players in the Indian telecom sector, such as Mukesh Ambani's Jio Satellite, Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s Project Kuiper, and Starlink. While these competitors also seek operational clearances, they are awaiting a government decision on the framework for spectrum allocation.

Despite the competitive landscape, Sunil Mittal downplayed the threat posed by Jio Satellite in the satcom services market, instead pointing to challenges from international entities like Starlink and Amazon. On the other hand, Mathew Oommen from Jio highlighted their readiness and established infrastructure capable of delivering gigabit-speed broadband-from-space services.

Both OneWeb and Jio are expanding into rural regions where broadband access is limited. OneWeb is preparing its geostationary orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for this purpose. Concurrently, Jio is working with SES Satellites' GEO and medium Earth orbit (MEO) constellation through its partnership.

As the industry anticipates the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to finalize methods for satellite spectrum allocation amidst debates over auction versus administrative assignment, SES’s new O3b mPOWER constellation faces delays unrelated to its Indian market presence or JioSpaceFiber's impending service launch. Despite these technical glitches, JioSpaceFiber's rollout remains on track with access to alternative satellite systems.

In light of these developments, India is poised to secure a significant share of the global space communication market which is estimated to reach $1 trillion by 2030. With ISRO's longstanding contributions to space technology and its focus on services that benefit the common man, India aims for a $40 billion stake in this burgeoning sector by 2040.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,Berkshire Hathaway divests from long-held stocks amid market shifts,https://in.investing.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-divests-from-longheld-stocks-amid-market-shifts-93CH-3910431,"Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE: ), the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett, has made significant changes to its investment portfolio, according to recent SEC filings. The company has completely divested from several long-standing holdings, including General Motors (NYSE:NYSE: ), United Parcel Service (NYSE:NYSE: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) International (NASDAQ:MDLZ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:NYSE: ), amid various economic pressures and strategic shifts.

The move comes as Berkshire's Class A shares have seen a near 4,400,000% gain since Buffett took the helm in the mid-1960s. Investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs have been active in reshaping the portfolio during the third quarter. The exit from General Motors, held since the first quarter of 2012, was likely influenced by increased labor costs following a new agreement with the United Auto Workers union and a downturn in electric vehicle demand as loan rates rise.

Similarly, UPS, part of Berkshire's portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, saw its remaining shares sold due to economic uncertainties and higher labor expenses stemming from new labor contracts. Mondelez International, with popular brands like Oreo and Ritz under its belt since the second quarter of 2007, was dropped amidst consumer resistance to price hikes and concerns over a heavy debt load that echoed issues seen during Kraft Heinz’s writedown incident.

Procter & Gamble, a Berkshire holding since the first quarter of 2005, was released as it faced volume declines and currency headwinds. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson, a staple in the portfolio since the first quarter of 2006, was sold off due to litigation issues related to talc cancer claims and Buffett’s preference not to closely track drug development catalysts—despite JNJ's strong value proposition indicated by its rare AAA credit rating.

Despite these sell-offs, Apple (NASDAQ: ) remains Berkshire's dominant position even though it experienced a valuation dip. Reduced positions were also noted in other companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), HP Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ), Aon (NYSE:NYSE: ), Markel (NYSE:NYSE: ), and Globe Life (NYSE:NYSE: ).

In contrast to these divestments, Berkshire Hathaway has made new investments including an $8 million interest in the Atlanta Braves baseball team and expanded holdings in Liberty Media with stakes in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Liberty Live Group. In addition to these acquisitions, Berkshire invested a fresh $44 million in Sirius XM (NASDAQ: ). To maintain competitive secrecy, Berkshire has sought confidential treatment for an undisclosed new holding.

With these portfolio adjustments reflecting Buffett's strategic thinking amid current market dynamics, Berkshire Hathaway's cash reserves have soared to a record $157 billion. This substantial cash pile underscores the conglomerate's ability to capitalize on investment opportunities or weather potential market downturns.

2022-11-22, Investing.com,"Rafael Holdings mirrors Amazon trajectory, shows investor promise",https://in.investing.com/news/rafael-holdings-mirrors-amazon-trajectory-shows-investor-promise-93CH-3909951,"Rafael Holdings (NYSE:RFL), often compared to the early days of Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), is drawing attention from investors for its notable financial strategy. Despite continuous losses and minimal revenue, the company stands out for operating without debt and securing a two-year cash runway as of July 2022. With $21 million in reserves, Rafael Holdings has managed to significantly reduce its annual cash burn by 58%, now at $11 million.

The company's ability to slash its cash burn from the previous year showcases a strategic effort to stabilize its financials. However, concerns loom over the company's long-term sustainability due to its limited income, which was reported at $279k last year. The current market capitalization of Rafael Holdings is $45 million, and any fundraising matching its annual cash burn could lead to substantial shareholder dilution—potentially up to 24% of its total market value.

Investors are closely watching Rafael Holdings as it navigates these challenges, with the company's performance evoking memories of Amazon.com's early struggles before it became a market giant. The comparison offers a glimmer of hope for those who see potential in Rafael Holdings' future despite the current financial hurdles.

2022-11-21, Investing.com,OneWeb India gets green light to launch satellite broadband services,https://in.investing.com/news/oneweb-india-gets-green-light-to-launch-satellite-broadband-services-93CH-3908183,"OneWeb India, a subsidiary of Eutelsat OneWeb, has been authorized by the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) to deploy satellite broadband services in India. This development positions OneWeb India ahead of competitors such as SpaceX's Starlink and Reliance (NS: )'s JioSpaceFiber, pending spectrum allocation by the Indian government.

The authorization for a five-year term was announced today, with Bharti Group's OneWeb India requiring spectrum assignment by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Sunil Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman of Bharti Group, highlighted this milestone as a significant step towards achieving the Digital India vision. He noted that the service will provide persistent internet coverage to rural and remote maritime areas in India.

Eutelsat OneWeb is prepared to offer its services following the completion of their Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation last year. Cyril Dujardin from Eutelsat Group confirmed the readiness of the company to begin operations. The constellation comprises 648 satellites designed to supply approximately 21 Gbps throughput over India, which could revolutionize connectivity across the nation.

OneWeb has already obtained permits from DoT for satellite communication and internet service provision and is now awaiting only spectrum allocation for direct customer broadcasts. The company has also received in-principle approvals for two gateways in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu (NS: ), which are expected to ensure robust connectivity throughout India.

The DoT is currently seeking advice from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on procedures for spectrum allocation. However, this process has been stalled due to the absence of a chairperson since October 1, following P D Vaghela's departure in September. Although Trai's recommendations are ready, they await the appointment of a new regulatory head before they can be released.

Bharti Airtel (NS: ), part of Bharti Group, plans to reduce data costs through satellite internet services. At JPMorgan’s summit last month, it was suggested that satellite technology could complement terrestrial networks, enhancing connectivity options for consumers. After their $3.4 billion merger last year, Eutelsat OneWeb is on track to achieve global coverage by January 24th and is now just steps away from commencing operations in India.

The move comes at a time when competition in the Indian satellite service sector is intensifying. Reliance has introduced its affordable satellite service while Starlink is yet to obtain an operating license in India. Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) continues to advance Project Kuiper by hiring locally.

Analysts at Macquarie have pointed out China’s increasing space activity as a point of interest in the global space race. In response to these developments, IN-SPACe regulates space affairs in India, with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) handling commercialization efforts within the sector.

2022-11-21, Investing.com,American Express shares rise with new Amazon rewards feature,https://in.investing.com/news/american-express-shares-rise-with-new-amazon-rewards-feature-93CH-3907106,"American Express (NYSE: ) shares experienced an uplift on Monday after the financial services corporation announced a new feature that allows cash-back cardholders to redeem their Reward Dollars directly on Amazon (NASDAQ: ). The innovative option offers a one-to-one value ratio, enabling customers to apply their rewards for full or partial payment when shopping on Amazon's website or through its app.

The move is seen as an effort to enhance customer loyalty, tapping into data suggesting that 65% of credit or debit card users show a preference for brands where they hold loyalty memberships and value personalized reward schemes. To benefit from this new feature, American Express cardholders must link their cards to their Amazon account and select ""Reward Dollars"" as their payment method at checkout.

This strategic initiative comes at a time when consumer financial pressures are mounting, with many Americans reportedly living paycheck to paycheck and feeling economically worse off than in the previous year. Nonetheless, there is a persistent trend of overspending during the holiday season, which this partnership could potentially capitalize on.

Wall Street analysts are currently maintaining a Hold consensus on AXP stock, which has seen an annual growth rate of 8.48%. The average price target for American Express stands at $176.38, suggesting an upside potential of approximately 8%.

Prior to Monday's announcement, October's earnings materials from American Express had already revealed an increase in network billed business by 7%, amounting to $420 billion, with leisure spending up by 13%. Additionally, a partnership development in July between Fiserv (NYSE: ) and Amazon through the uChoose rewards program was highlighted by Rajeev Yerukalapudi. He underscored the significant value consumers place on having choices in how they redeem points. This collaboration also allows customers to use points at Amazon checkout, supporting research from Banyan that tailored rewards can strengthen customer loyalty.

2022-11-20, Investing.com,Wells Fargo employees push for unionization amid labor disputes,https://in.investing.com/news/wells-fargo-employees-push-for-unionization-amid-labor-disputes-93CH-3906161,"Workers at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) branches in Albuquerque and Bethel are pushing forward with efforts to unionize, seeking to hold elections under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). This move comes as a wave of labor organization gains momentum across various sectors, with significant successes at companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:SBUX) and advantageous contracts secured by the United Auto Workers.

At the heart of the push is a call to action by organizing leader Jessie McCool, who advocates taking advantage of this favorable period for unions. In response to these efforts, Wells Fargo's CEO Saul Van Beurden has highlighted the bank's steps to improve employee benefits, citing changes made following prior feedback from staff.

The drive for unionization is fueled by staffing challenges that have persisted since the pandemic. Employees such as Sabrina Perez in Albuquerque find themselves burdened with extra roles, leading to customer service complaints. Similarly, Bethel's Walker Sexton struggles with wage issues, even after cost-of-living adjustments, which have forced him to take on a second job.

These grievances echo past successes in unionization efforts, such as those seen at Beneficial State Bank, and are further sharpened by the lingering effects of Wells Fargo's sales scandal on worker morale. In an apparent response to these union activities, Wells Fargo has recently appointed a head of labor relations while facing reports of interference with union activities.

As the situation unfolds, Wells Fargo has underscored its commitment to its workforce by raising pay and enhancing benefits for its lower-paid employees. The bank's actions come at a critical juncture as its employees seek formal recognition of their unions through official channels.

InvestingPro Insights

Looking at the real-time data from InvestingPro, Wells Fargo has a market cap of 156.02B USD and a P/E ratio of 9.3 as of Q3 2022. The company's revenue growth for the same period was 2.01%, indicating a steady performance.

From the InvestingPro Tips, it's noteworthy that the management has been aggressively buying back shares, which can be a positive sign for investors. Moreover, 10 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating a positive sentiment about the bank's future profitability.

Wells Fargo has also maintained dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, providing a consistent return for shareholders. This, coupled with a P/E ratio trading at a low relative to near-term earnings growth, suggests the bank's stock could potentially be undervalued.

2022-11-18, Investing.com,Nvidia maintains lead in AI market as AMD faces challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-maintains-lead-in-ai-market-as-amd-faces-challenges-93CH-3905300,"NEW YORK - As the artificial intelligence (AI) sector grows, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is grappling with the challenge of catching up to Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s lead, primarily due to Nvidia's comprehensive hardware-software ecosystem. Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 31%, while AMD reported an 8% decline in gaming revenues. The success of Nvidia is partly attributed to its CUDA software, which has become a standard in AI development.

Despite these challenges, AMD has seen a surge in sales for its AMD 7000 series laptop chips, with an increase of 41%. This growth comes amidst a broader effort by cloud industry leaders, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), to develop their own proprietary AI chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia. Yet, these companies continue to invest in Nvidia's products due to its established ecosystem.

Nvidia's strategy of expanding into cloud services aims to reinforce its market position. The company's financial health is robust, with profit margins nearing 25%, significantly outpacing AMD's 4%. This stark contrast in profitability underlines why Nvidia may continue to be a more attractive investment option compared to AMD. Despite projections hinting at AMD's faster growth in 2024, Nvidia is expected to hold onto its leadership position.

Tech giants and investors are closely watching these developments. who holds positions in both AMD and Nvidia as well as other tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel (NASDAQ: ), considers his investment in AMD as a strategic hedge against his larger stake in Nvidia. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) has opted not to challenge Nvidia's GPU capabilities for AI tasks, further cementing Nvidia's dominance in the market.

As the AI revolution demands more processing power, both companies are likely to remain critical players. However, for now, Nvidia's combined hardware-software offerings give it an edge reminiscent of Intel’s past market dominance but with the added leverage of being a crucial software provider akin to Microsoft. In contrast, AMD continues to navigate the market as a secondary supplier.

2022-11-18, IANS,Musk to sue non-profit Media Matters as big companies pause ads,https://in.investing.com/news/musk-to-sue-nonprofit-media-matters-as-big-companies-pause-ads-3905240,"San Francisco, Nov 18 (IANS) Elon Musk on Saturday said X will file a “thermonuclear lawsuit” against non-profit organisation Media Matters and those who “colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company,” as big advertisers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Disney, Warner Bros, IBM (NYSE: ) and others reportedly paused advertising on the platform for allegedly promote antisemitism. Media Matters in its report had claimed that as Musk continues his descent into white nationalist and antisemitic conspiracy theories, his social media platform has been placing ads for major brands like Apple, Bravo (NBCUniversal), IBM, Oracle (NYSE: ), and Xfinity (Comcast (NASDAQ: )) next to content that supports Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.

The report led to tech and media majors like Apple, IBM, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery, Paramount and Comcast/NBCUniversal reportedly pulling or halting their advertisements, along with Lionsgate and European Commission, on X.

The billionaire X owner posted: “The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company.""

“Their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them,” he added.

Musk also posted a letter, defending his company and slamming Media Matters report and legacy media organisation.

“Despite our clear and consistent position, X has seen a number of attacks from activist groups like Media Matters and legacy media outlets who seek to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they perceive it as a threat to their ideological narrative and those of their financial supporters,” the letter read.

The letter alleged that these groups try to use their influence to attack “our revenue streams by deceiving advertisers on X”.

“To manipulate the public and advertisers, Media Matters created an alternate account and curated the posts and advertising appearing on the account's timeline to misinform advertisers about the placement of their posts,” the letter argued.

Earlier on Saturday, Musk posted: ""Media Matters is pure evil.""

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that their point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should stop across the board.

""When it comes to this platform -- X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's no place for it anywhere in the world -- it's ugly and wrong. Full stop,"" she posted.

2022-11-18, IANS,Using advanced AI to spot & remove fake customer reviews: Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/using-advanced-ai-to-spot--remove-fake-customer-reviews-amazon-3905223,"New Delhi, Nov 18 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has said it is using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to to spot inauthentic product reviews on the platform, ahead of Black Friday amid the ongoing holiday shopping season.The company said late on Friday that before being published online, Amazon is using AI to analyse the review for known indicators that the review is fake.

“The vast majority of reviews pass Amazon’s high bar for authenticity and get posted right away. However, if potential review abuse is detected, there are several paths the company takes,” said the company.

If Amazon is confident the review is fake, they move quickly to block or remove the review and take further action when necessary, including revoking a customer’s review permissions, blocking bad actor accounts, and even litigating against the parties involved.

“If a review is suspicious but additional evidence is needed, Amazon’s expert investigators who are specially trained to identify abusive behaviour look for other signals before taking action,” the e-commerce giant noted.

Last year, Amazon observed and proactively blocked more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in its stores worldwide.

“Fake reviews intentionally mislead customers by providing information that is not impartial, authentic, or intended for that product or service,” said Josh Meek, senior data science manager on Amazon’s Fraud Abuse and Prevention team.

“We work hard to responsibly monitor and enforce our policies to ensure reviews reflect the views of real customers, and protect honest sellers who rely on us to get it right,” Meek added.

Among other measures, Amazon uses the latest advancements in AI to stop hundreds of millions of suspected fake online reviews, manipulated ratings, fake customer accounts, and other abuses before customers see them.

Machine learning models analyze a multitude of proprietary data including whether the seller has invested in ads (which may be driving additional reviews), customer-submitted reports of abuse, risky behavioural patterns, review history, and more.

Large language models are used alongside natural language processing techniques to analyse anomalies in this data that might indicate that a review is fake or incentivised with a gift card, free product, or some other form of reimbursement.

“The difference between an authentic and fake review is not always clear for someone outside of Amazon to spot,” Meek said.

The number of employees being impacted by the decision in India could not be ascertained yet.

The e-commerce giant will ""communicate with impacted colleagues in India next week"".

In a memo sent to employees, Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV team, said that the company is eliminating “several hundred roles”.

“As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers -- which includes maximising our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,” he told employees in the memo.

“These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in several hundred roles being eliminated,” Rausch added.

He said that the company “will communicate with impacted colleagues in India next week, and are following local processes in other regions, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies, and possibly resulting in longer timelines to communicate”.

Amazon did not provide further details on the initiatives being discontinued.

The e-commerce giant had conducted layoffs in its Devices & Services division last year as part of company-wide cuts.

Rausch said that the investments in generative AI are bringing “our vision for an even more intuitive, intelligent, and useful Alexa closer than ever before”.

“We will reach out to colleagues in the US and Canada who are impacted by these role reductions. Notification emails will be sent out shortly, and we expect all notifications in the .S and Canada to be completed this morning (Pacific time),” the memo further read.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,Microsoft introduces Maia AI accelerator to challenge Nvidia's market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-introduces-maia-ai-accelerator-to-challenge-nvidias-market-dominance-93CH-3904737,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) has announced the launch of its first custom AI accelerator, Maia, along with an Arm-based data center CPU named Cobalt, signaling a strategic move into the custom chip market to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s stronghold. The reveal occurred during the Ignite conference on Wednesday, as the tech giant seeks to offer cost-effective alternatives in the rapidly growing AI accelerator market.

Maia is poised as a direct competitor to Nvidia's high-cost GPUs, which can reach up to $30,000 per chip. Despite such prices, Nvidia has maintained an 80-95% market share and reported a net margin of 50% last quarter. Microsoft's Maia aims to disrupt this by running on more affordable Ethernet networking equipment, unlike Nvidia's reliance on Infiniband infrastructure. Additionally, Microsoft has developed a unique server rack equipped with liquid cooling specifically for Maia and future AI accelerators.

The design of Maia benefited from a collaboration with OpenAI, optimizing it for AI models and algorithms. This partnership reflects Microsoft's broader commitment to AI as evidenced by its investment in OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT.

Cobalt, Microsoft's new CPU, enters the market to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s Graviton CPU, which currently boasts adoption by 50,000 AWS cloud customers. The introduction of these new chips does not signify a departure from existing technologies for Microsoft. The company plans to continue deploying systems with Nvidia H100 and AMD (NASDAQ: ) MI300 chips and has pre-announced the availability of Nvidia's H200 system for next year.

The strategic inclusion of both specialized and generalized AI accelerators in its cloud offerings suggests that Microsoft is positioning itself to cater to diverse computing needs while also pushing for more cost-effective solutions. This move could potentially alter the market dynamics currently dominated by expensive GPUs.

The AI accelerator market itself is on a trajectory of rapid growth, projected to reach $150 billion by 2027. With this expansion comes increased competition and innovation as companies like Microsoft forge ahead with custom solutions like Maia and Cobalt to meet the demands of AI training and inference workloads.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3904586,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."

Hyundai also said that it will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider and will integrate Alexa voice assistant in its future vehicles, according to the report.

(NASDAQ: ) experienced a downturn on Thursday, ending its two-day rally with a 3.71% drop in stock price to $20.75. The decline came amid a day of mixed market performance, where the S&P 500 Index saw a slight increase of 0.12%, while the edged down by 0.13%.

Despite Thursday's fall, Walgreens' closing price remains significantly below its 52-week high of $42.29 reached on December 13, 2022, missing that peak by $21.54.

Trading activity for Walgreens also fell short of its usual pace, with volumes registering 2 million shares below the 50-day average. This decrease in trading volume may reflect investors' cautious approach amid the current market conditions.

Investors and market watchers will continue to monitor Walgreens' performance closely, especially in relation to its competitors, as it navigates through the fluctuating retail pharmacy landscape.

2022-11-21, Investing.com,OneWeb India gets green light to launch satellite broadband services,https://in.investing.com/news/oneweb-india-gets-green-light-to-launch-satellite-broadband-services-93CH-3908183,"OneWeb India, a subsidiary of Eutelsat OneWeb, has been authorized by the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) to deploy satellite broadband services in India. This development positions OneWeb India ahead of competitors such as SpaceX's Starlink and Reliance (NS: )'s JioSpaceFiber, pending spectrum allocation by the Indian government.

The authorization for a five-year term was announced today, with Bharti Group's OneWeb India requiring spectrum assignment by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). Sunil Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman of Bharti Group, highlighted this milestone as a significant step towards achieving the Digital India vision. He noted that the service will provide persistent internet coverage to rural and remote maritime areas in India.

Eutelsat OneWeb is prepared to offer its services following the completion of their Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation last year. Cyril Dujardin from Eutelsat Group confirmed the readiness of the company to begin operations. The constellation comprises 648 satellites designed to supply approximately 21 Gbps throughput over India, which could revolutionize connectivity across the nation.

OneWeb has already obtained permits from DoT for satellite communication and internet service provision and is now awaiting only spectrum allocation for direct customer broadcasts. The company has also received in-principle approvals for two gateways in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu (NS: ), which are expected to ensure robust connectivity throughout India.

The DoT is currently seeking advice from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on procedures for spectrum allocation. However, this process has been stalled due to the absence of a chairperson since October 1, following P D Vaghela's departure in September. Although Trai's recommendations are ready, they await the appointment of a new regulatory head before they can be released.

Bharti Airtel (NS: ), part of Bharti Group, plans to reduce data costs through satellite internet services. At JPMorgan’s summit last month, it was suggested that satellite technology could complement terrestrial networks, enhancing connectivity options for consumers. After their $3.4 billion merger last year, Eutelsat OneWeb is on track to achieve global coverage by January 24th and is now just steps away from commencing operations in India.

The move comes at a time when competition in the Indian satellite service sector is intensifying. Reliance has introduced its affordable satellite service while Starlink is yet to obtain an operating license in India. Meanwhile, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) continues to advance Project Kuiper by hiring locally.

Analysts at Macquarie have pointed out China’s increasing space activity as a point of interest in the global space race. In response to these developments, IN-SPACe regulates space affairs in India, with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) handling commercialization efforts within the sector.

The innovative option offers a one-to-one value ratio, enabling customers to apply their rewards for full or partial payment when shopping on Amazon's website or through its app.

This strategic initiative comes at a time when consumer financial pressures are mounting, with many Americans reportedly living paycheck to paycheck and feeling economically worse off than in the previous year.

Wall Street analysts are currently maintaining a Hold consensus on AXP stock, which has seen an annual growth rate of 8.48%. The average price target for American Express stands at $176.38, suggesting an upside potential of approximately 8%.

Prior to Monday's announcement, October's earnings materials from American Express had already revealed an increase in network billed business by 7%, amounting to $420 billion, with leisure spending up by 13%. Additionally, a partnership development in July between Fiserv (NYSE: ) and Amazon through the uChoose rewards program was highlighted by Rajeev Yerukalapudi. He underscored the significant value consumers place on having choices in how they redeem points.

2022-11-20, Investing.com,Wells Fargo employees push for unionization amid labor disputes,https://in.investing.com/news/wells-fargo-employees-push-for-unionization-amid-labor-disputes-93CH-3906161,"Workers at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) branches in Albuquerque and Bethel are pushing forward with efforts to unionize, seeking to hold elections under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). This move comes as a wave of labor organization gains momentum across various sectors, with significant successes at companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:SBUX) and advantageous contracts secured by the United Auto Workers.

At the heart of the push is a call to action by organizing leader Jessie McCool, who advocates taking advantage of this favorable period for unions. In response to these efforts, Wells Fargo's CEO Saul Van Beurden has highlighted the bank's steps to improve employee benefits, citing changes made following prior feedback from staff.

The drive for unionization is fueled by staffing challenges that have persisted since the pandemic. Employees such as Sabrina Perez in Albuquerque find themselves burdened with extra roles, leading to customer service complaints. Similarly, Bethel's Walker Sexton struggles with wage issues, even after cost-of-living adjustments, which have forced him to take on a second job.

These grievances echo past successes in unionization efforts, such as those seen at Beneficial State Bank, and are further sharpened by the lingering effects of Wells Fargo's sales scandal on worker morale. In an apparent response to these union activities, Wells Fargo has recently appointed a head of labor relations while facing reports of interference with union activities.

As the situation unfolds, Wells Fargo has underscored its commitment to its workforce by raising pay and enhancing benefits for its lower-paid employees. The bank's actions come at a critical juncture as its employees seek formal recognition of their unions through official channels.

InvestingPro Insights

Looking at the real-time data from InvestingPro, Wells Fargo has a market cap of 156.02B USD and a P/E ratio of 9.3 as of Q3 2022. The company's revenue growth for the same period was 2.01%, indicating a steady performance.

From the InvestingPro Tips, it's noteworthy that the management has been aggressively buying back shares, which can be a positive sign for investors. Moreover, 10 analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, indicating a positive sentiment about the bank's future profitability.

Wells Fargo has also maintained dividend payments for 53 consecutive years, providing a consistent return for shareholders. This, coupled with a P/E ratio trading at a low relative to near-term earnings growth, suggests the bank's stock could potentially be undervalued.

2022-11-18, Investing.com,Nvidia maintains lead in AI market as AMD faces challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-maintains-lead-in-ai-market-as-amd-faces-challenges-93CH-3905300,"NEW YORK - As the artificial intelligence (AI) sector grows, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is grappling with the challenge of catching up to Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s lead, primarily due to Nvidia's comprehensive hardware-software ecosystem. Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 31%, while AMD reported an 8% decline in gaming revenues. The success of Nvidia is partly attributed to its CUDA software, which has become a standard in AI development.

Despite these challenges, AMD has seen a surge in sales for its AMD 7000 series laptop chips, with an increase of 41%. This growth comes amidst a broader effort by cloud industry leaders, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), to develop their own proprietary AI chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia. Yet, these companies continue to invest in Nvidia's products due to its established ecosystem.

Nvidia's strategy of expanding into cloud services aims to reinforce its market position. The company's financial health is robust, with profit margins nearing 25%, significantly outpacing AMD's 4%. This stark contrast in profitability underlines why Nvidia may continue to be a more attractive investment option compared to AMD. Despite projections hinting at AMD's faster growth in 2024, Nvidia is expected to hold onto its leadership position.

Tech giants and investors are closely watching these developments. who holds positions in both AMD and Nvidia as well as other tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel (NASDAQ: ), considers his investment in AMD as a strategic hedge against his larger stake in Nvidia. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) has opted not to challenge Nvidia's GPU capabilities for AI tasks, further cementing Nvidia's dominance in the market.

As the AI revolution demands more processing power, both companies are likely to remain critical players. However, for now, Nvidia's combined hardware-software offerings give it an edge reminiscent of Intel’s past market dominance but with the added leverage of being a crucial software provider akin to Microsoft. In contrast, AMD continues to navigate the market as a secondary supplier.

Media Matters in its report had claimed that as Musk continues his descent into white nationalist and antisemitic conspiracy theories, his social media platform has been placing ads for major brands like Apple, Bravo (NBCUniversal), IBM, Oracle (NYSE: ), and Xfinity (Comcast (NASDAQ: )) next to content that supports Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party.

The report led to tech and media majors like Apple, IBM, Disney, Warner Bros, Discovery, Paramount and Comcast/NBCUniversal reportedly pulling or halting their advertisements, along with Lionsgate and European Commission, on X.

The billionaire X owner posted: “The split second court opens on Monday, X Corp will be filing a thermonuclear lawsuit against Media Matters and ALL those who colluded in this fraudulent attack on our company.""

“Their board, their donors, their network of dark money, all of them,” he added.

Musk also posted a letter, defending his company and slamming Media Matters report and legacy media organisation.

“Despite our clear and consistent position, X has seen a number of attacks from activist groups like Media Matters and legacy media outlets who seek to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they perceive it as a threat to their ideological narrative and those of their financial supporters,” the letter read.

The letter alleged that these groups try to use their influence to attack “our revenue streams by deceiving advertisers on X”.

“To manipulate the public and advertisers, Media Matters created an alternate account and curated the posts and advertising appearing on the account's timeline to misinform advertisers about the placement of their posts,” the letter argued.

Earlier on Saturday, Musk posted: ""Media Matters is pure evil.""

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said that their point of view has always been very clear that discrimination by everyone should stop across the board.

""When it comes to this platform -- X has also been extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination. There's no place for it anywhere in the world -- it's ugly and wrong. Full stop,"" she posted.

2022-11-18, IANS,Using advanced AI to spot & remove fake customer reviews: Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/using-advanced-ai-to-spot--remove-fake-customer-reviews-amazon-3905223,"New Delhi, Nov 18 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has said it is using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to to spot inauthentic product reviews on the platform, ahead of Black Friday amid the ongoing holiday shopping season.The company said late on Friday that before being published online, Amazon is using AI to analyse the review for known indicators that the review is fake.

“The vast majority of reviews pass Amazon’s high bar for authenticity and get posted right away. However, if potential review abuse is detected, there are several paths the company takes,” said the company.

If Amazon is confident the review is fake, they move quickly to block or remove the review and take further action when necessary, including revoking a customer’s review permissions, blocking bad actor accounts, and even litigating against the parties involved.

“If a review is suspicious but additional evidence is needed, Amazon’s expert investigators who are specially trained to identify abusive behaviour look for other signals before taking action,” the e-commerce giant noted.

Last year, Amazon observed and proactively blocked more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in its stores worldwide.

“Fake reviews intentionally mislead customers by providing information that is not impartial, authentic, or intended for that product or service,” said Josh Meek, senior data science manager on Amazon’s Fraud Abuse and Prevention team.

“We work hard to responsibly monitor and enforce our policies to ensure reviews reflect the views of real customers, and protect honest sellers who rely on us to get it right,” Meek added.

Among other measures, Amazon uses the latest advancements in AI to stop hundreds of millions of suspected fake online reviews, manipulated ratings, fake customer accounts, and other abuses before customers see them.

Machine learning models analyze a multitude of proprietary data including whether the seller has invested in ads (which may be driving additional reviews), customer-submitted reports of abuse, risky behavioural patterns, review history, and more.

Large language models are used alongside natural language processing techniques to analyse anomalies in this data that might indicate that a review is fake or incentivised with a gift card, free product, or some other form of reimbursement.

2022-11-18, IANS,Amazon lays off employees in India amid global churning in Alexa division,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-lays-off-employees-in-india-amid-global-churning-in-alexa-division-3905216,"New Delhi, Nov 18 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has announced to lay off “several hundred employees” from its Alexa division, including in India, amid a renewed focus on artificial intelligence (AI). The number of employees being impacted by the decision in India could not be ascertained yet.

The e-commerce giant will ""communicate with impacted colleagues in India next week"".

In a memo sent to employees, Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV team, said that the company is eliminating “several hundred roles”.

“As we continue to invent, we’re shifting some of our efforts to better align with our business priorities, and what we know matters most to customers -- which includes maximising our resources and efforts focused on generative AI,” he told employees in the memo.

“These shifts are leading us to discontinue some initiatives, which is resulting in several hundred roles being eliminated,” Rausch added.

He said that the company “will communicate with impacted colleagues in India next week, and are following local processes in other regions, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies, and possibly resulting in longer timelines to communicate”.

Amazon did not provide further details on the initiatives being discontinued.

The e-commerce giant had conducted layoffs in its Devices & Services division last year as part of company-wide cuts.

Rausch said that the investments in generative AI are bringing “our vision for an even more intuitive, intelligent, and useful Alexa closer than ever before”.

“We will reach out to colleagues in the US and Canada who are impacted by these role reductions. Notification emails will be sent out shortly, and we expect all notifications in the .S and Canada to be completed this morning (Pacific time),” the memo further read.

""To those of you impacted by these reductions, please know we did not make this decision lightly,"" it added.

The company is providing impacted employees packages that include a separation payment, transitional health insurance benefits, external job placement support, and paid time to conduct job search.

Dave Limp, in charge of the Devices & Services division at Amazon, in August announced to leave the company.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

Apple, the consumer electronics giant valued at $2.9 trillion, has managed to limit its revenue decline to just 3% despite an 11% drop in iPhone sales, maintaining a dominant 55% market share in the U.S. smartphone sector. The company's venture into artificial intelligence (AI) areas further bolsters its strong market prospects.

On the other side, Amazon has made a significant turnaround from its previous e-commerce losses, posting an impressive $4 billion in operating income for the recent quarter. This recovery is attributed to strategic cost reductions and layoffs that have helped it navigate economic downturns. Amazon continues to lead in both e-commerce and cloud computing, with AWS maintaining its supremacy in the market.

These industry-leading companies are not only favorites among global shoppers but are also setting records that underscore their technological dominance. As they continue to expand into sectors expected to grow substantially, their positions seem well-poised for future success.

While these two tech titans are thriving, The Motley Fool's Stock Advisor suggests there are ten other stocks that could potentially outperform Apple for investors at this time. However, the current achievements of Apple and Amazon highlight their adaptability and robust performance even as the broader U.S. smartphone market faces difficulties, as reported by Counterpoint Research data.

Both companies' share growth reflects investor confidence and their ability to capitalize on market opportunities despite broader economic pressures. With Apple reaching new peaks in consumer electronics and Amazon showcasing its resilience in e-commerce and cloud services, these firms exemplify enduring strength in the volatile tech industry.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,Microsoft introduces Maia AI accelerator to challenge Nvidia's market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-introduces-maia-ai-accelerator-to-challenge-nvidias-market-dominance-93CH-3904737,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) has announced the launch of its first custom AI accelerator, Maia, along with an Arm-based data center CPU named Cobalt, signaling a strategic move into the custom chip market to challenge Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s stronghold. The reveal occurred during the Ignite conference on Wednesday, as the tech giant seeks to offer cost-effective alternatives in the rapidly growing AI accelerator market.

Maia is poised as a direct competitor to Nvidia's high-cost GPUs, which can reach up to $30,000 per chip. Despite such prices, Nvidia has maintained an 80-95% market share and reported a net margin of 50% last quarter. Microsoft's Maia aims to disrupt this by running on more affordable Ethernet networking equipment, unlike Nvidia's reliance on Infiniband infrastructure. Additionally, Microsoft has developed a unique server rack equipped with liquid cooling specifically for Maia and future AI accelerators.

The design of Maia benefited from a collaboration with OpenAI, optimizing it for AI models and algorithms. This partnership reflects Microsoft's broader commitment to AI as evidenced by its investment in OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT.

Cobalt, Microsoft's new CPU, enters the market to compete with Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s Graviton CPU, which currently boasts adoption by 50,000 AWS cloud customers. The introduction of these new chips does not signify a departure from existing technologies for Microsoft. The company plans to continue deploying systems with Nvidia H100 and AMD (NASDAQ: ) MI300 chips and has pre-announced the availability of Nvidia's H200 system for next year.

The strategic inclusion of both specialized and generalized AI accelerators in its cloud offerings suggests that Microsoft is positioning itself to cater to diverse computing needs while also pushing for more cost-effective solutions. This move could potentially alter the market dynamics currently dominated by expensive GPUs.

The AI accelerator market itself is on a trajectory of rapid growth, projected to reach $150 billion by 2027. With this expansion comes increased competition and innovation as companies like Microsoft forge ahead with custom solutions like Maia and Cobalt to meet the demands of AI training and inference workloads.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3904586,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."

""Amazon also brings massive reach and marketing power to connect to more customers. We can’t wait to get started,"" he was quoted as saying in the report.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs highlights seven tech giants as market leaders,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-highlights-seven-tech-giants-as-market-leaders-93CH-3904267,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) has spotlighted a group of seven technology stocks, known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), for their standout financial performance and strong balance sheets. These companies are expected to continue leading the market into the next year due to their ability to reinvest and drive superior financial results.

Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, has identified these tech giants as critical players in the stock market. They are often referred to by financial acronyms and are benchmarked against a specific index to track their collective performance.

In the backdrop of a resilient economy with a robust labor market and cooling inflation, Goldman Sachs offers an optimistic outlook. The unemployment rate was recorded at 3.9% in October, with a year-on-year price increase standing at 3.2%. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasts a GDP growth of 2.4% for 2022 and expects similar growth of 2.1% in 2024.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is anticipated to shift towards gradual rate cuts in the second half of 2024, with Hatzius assigning a 15% chance of recession within the next 12 months. The is projected to see moderate growth, ending at 4,700 next year, marking a 5% increase.

Kostin recommends focusing on quality stocks as a high-conviction investment approach and predicts modest earnings growth of 5% for both 2024 and 2025.

Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18; however, on an equal-weighted basis, this ratio drops to 14.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Amazon and Hyundai Partner to Deliver Innovative Customer Experiences and Cloud Transformation,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-and-hyundai-partner-to-deliver-innovative-customer-experiences-and-cloud-transformation-432SI-3904084,"Today, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Hyundai Motor Company (OTC: ) announced a broad strategic partnership to bring innovative new experiences to customers. The announcement was made today at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show and a livestream can be viewed here: https://youtube.com/live/Qzhq1tShTMc. This strategic collaboration includes Amazon launching online sale of Hyundai vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, Hyundai naming AWS as its preferred cloud provider to help facilitate digital transformation, and the Alexa Built-in experience coming to Hyundai’s next-generation vehicles.

“Hyundai is a very innovative company that shares Amazon’s passion for trying to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. “Our broad, strategic partnership should do just that, from changing the ease with which customers can buy vehicles online, to making it simple to use Alexa in Hyundai vehicles for entertainment, shopping, smart home adjustments, and calendar checks, to enabling Hyundai to transform their customer experiences and business operations by moving to AWS. We look forward to inventing together for many years.”

“Partnering with one of the world’s most customer-centric organizations unlocks incredible opportunities as we continue to expand our portfolio, grow our sales network, transition to electrification and realize the future of smart mobility,” said President and CEO of Hyundai Motor (OTC: ) Company Jaehoon (Jay) Chang. “Amazon is the ideal partner to help realize our vision of progress for humanity, including improving how people and goods move more efficiently and sustainably. Hyundai is the first automotive company available for full end-to-end transactions in Amazon’s U.S. store and this is another example of how we continue to push for ways to elevate the customer journey together with our outstanding retail partners.”

Some more details around what Amazon and Hyundai are announcing today include:

Vehicle Sales: In 2024, auto dealers for the first time will be able to sell vehicles in Amazon’s U.S. store, and Hyundai will be the first brand available for customers to purchase. This new digital shopping experience will make it easy for customers to purchase a new car online, and then pick it up or have it delivered by their local dealership at a time that works best for them. Customers will be able to search on Amazon for available vehicles in their area based on a range of preferences, including model, trim, color, and features, choose their preferred car, and then check out online with their chosen payment and financing options—all within the Amazon experience they already know and trust. This new shopping experience will create another way for dealers to build awareness of their selection and offer convenience to their customers.

Cloud Transformation: Hyundai has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate its digital transformation using broad and industry-leading AWS capabilities—from compute, storage, database, and analytics to generative AI and Internet of Things (IoT). As part of a new multiyear agreement, Hyundai will become a more data-driven organization with a cloud-first technology strategy, migrating its current on-premises applications—which support everything across research, product engineering, and customer engagement—to AWS. Hyundai will prioritize business cases like manufacturing and supply chain to help optimize production and minimize costs, security and disaster recovery for resiliency, and connected vehicle development to bring new features to drivers around the globe. AWS and Hyundai have designed and implemented a Master Builder training and certification program to train Hyundai engineers in critical cloud skills.

In-Vehicle Solutions: Starting in 2025, customers who purchase Hyundai’s next-generation vehicles will be able to access the hands-free Alexa experience they have at home, while in their car. Hyundai drivers will be able to simply ask Alexa to play music, podcasts, or audiobooks, set reminders, update to-do lists, and check calendars. Customers will also be able to control their smart home from the road, such as asking to warm up the house on their way home, double-checking doors are locked, and managing smart lighting and Alexa routines. Drivers will also be able to ask Alexa for up-to-date traffic updates or weather reports and voice-control the in-vehicle media player or navigation system—with certain Alexa features accessible even when internet connectivity is intermittent or not available."
2022-11-16, Investing.com,Tech sector defies rate hikes with AI-driven surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-defies-rate-hikes-with-aidriven-surge-93CH-3903947,"NEW YORK - The tech sector has demonstrated remarkable tenacity in 2022, rallying impressively despite the Federal Reserve's significant interest rate increases. This year, the S&P 500’s Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) experienced a substantial 46.5% boost as of November 15, primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The Federal Reserve has been on a campaign to tighten monetary policy, raising interest rates by a total of 525 basis points since March 2022. The current benchmark interest rate sits between 5.25% and 5.5%. Historically, such hikes tend to dampen growth in sectors like technology due to increased borrowing costs. However, tech stocks have shown a surprising ability to bounce back from periodic dips. This resilience is highlighted by the 's impressive year-to-year climb of 34.8%.

Major players in the tech industry, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have played a pivotal role in the S&P 500’s overall rise of 17.3% year to date.

The momentum for tech stocks saw a resurgence in November following the Federal Reserve's decision during its last FOMC meeting to maintain interest rates for the second time in a row.

Investors are now optimistic as expectations mount over cooling inflation, suggesting that the central bank may pivot away from its current hawkish stance and potentially start reducing interest rates in 2024. This anticipated shift is seen as beneficial for the tech sector.

In light of these developments, certain tech sector funds are gaining attention for their strong performance and investment potential. Funds such as the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (NASDAQ:FSELX), Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund (NASDAQ:SLMCX), and T. Rowe Price Science & Tech Fund (NASDAQ:PRSCX) come highly recommended due to their impressive track records. These funds also boast strong Zacks Mutual Fund rankings, are accessible with reasonable minimum initial investment amounts, and offer competitive low expense ratios, making them attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's robust performance amidst a challenging economic environment shaped by high interest rates.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,BlackRock warns of low thematic growth exposure in U.S. portfolios,https://in.investing.com/news/blackrock-warns-of-low-thematic-growth-exposure-in-us-portfolios-93CH-3902798,"NEW YORK - BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning to investors regarding the perceived adequacy of their thematic growth exposure through major technology stocks. Jay Jacobs, a senior executive at BlackRock, highlighted that many U.S. wealth investors might be underestimating their portfolios' actual exposure to transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), medical innovation, and the changing landscape of globalization.

According to BlackRock's 2024 Thematic Outlook Report, most investments in AI come from the large-cap tech firms known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ). However, the report underscores that no theme has more than 1.5% pure-play exposure, suggesting that investors relying solely on these megacap stocks may not have significant investment in these key areas.

To better capture the next wave of growth in AI, Jacobs recommends diversifying into specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA: IRBO) are noted for their potential to tap into AI advancements. Jacobs predicts that significant growth opportunities will arise within small and mid-cap companies in this space. Additionally, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IHAK) is identified as being closely tied to the AI theme.

In terms of globalization trends, Jacobs points out that Mexico has recently surpassed China and Canada to become the largest trade partner with the United States. To capitalize on this shift, he suggests considering investments in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW) and the iShares MSCI India ETF (NYSEARCA: INDA).

The medical innovation sector is also undergoing significant changes due to demographic shifts in the U.S., with the population hitting ""peak 65"" and experiencing what BlackRock calls a 'Historical Reversal'. To engage with this theme, BlackRock has identified several funds including the BlackRock Future Health ETF (BMED), iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF (NASDAQ: IBRN).

Investors are being urged to reassess their portfolios to ensure they are not overlooking opportunities for thematic growth beyond the dominant tech giants. By considering a broader range of targeted ETFs, they may be able to achieve a more robust exposure to these burgeoning sectors.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,Amazon Announces Astro for Business,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-announces-astro-for-business-432SI-3902782,"Amazon (AMZN) today announced Astro for Business, a security solution for small and medium-sized businesses that combines robotics, smart security, and artificial intelligence (AI). Customers can tailor Astro for Business with separately sold subscriptions that each provide incremental benefits when layered on top of each other. This includes Ring Protect Pro and Astro Secure, a new subscription offering advanced business security features, like smart alerts, custom patrol routes, and scheduled patrols. Customers can also add Virtual Security Guard for additional professional monitoring capabilities. From checking in after hours to having Astro patrol and send alerts if something is amiss, Astro for Business gives business owners eyes in more places and peace of mind knowing that they can better protect their business.

“Security continues to be a headache for business owners. According to the National Retail Federation, businesses have faced losses of nearly $100 billion in 2022. But traditional security solutions can be too static or expensive for what businesses need. We think Astro for Business can help with that,” said Anthony Robson, head of product for Amazon Astro. “We have been testing Astro in a variety of businesses and have seen firsthand how Astro’s intelligent motion helped provide visibility on blind spots and areas that existing stationary cameras couldn’t see, giving business owners peace of mind because their inventory and property are protected, even when they aren’t there.”

Astro for Business is designed to give customers eyes on their business 24/7, even after they’ve gone home for the night. It can map up to 5,000 square feet, and customers can use live view, two-way talk, Astro’s HD periscope camera with night vision, and visual ID to receive unrecognized person smart alerts. Additional subscriptions offer enhanced security benefits when layered on top of each other.

Ring Protect Pro: Subscribing to Ring Protect Pro lets customers save Astro for Business video history for up to 180 days and sync Astro for Business with Ring Alarm to link Ring Motion Detectors and window and door Ring Alarm Contact Sensors for alerts when a Ring Alarm is triggered.

Astro Secure: A new subscription built specifically for business environments that enables Astro to patrol autonomously and lets customers create multiple security monitoring routes tailored to their business, with specific viewpoints and frequencies. Astro can also send customers smart alerts when it hears the sounds of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms or glass breaking, and with a synced Ring Alarm, Astro can also move autonomously to triggered sensors to investigate.

Astro can also send customers smart alerts when it hears the sounds of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms or glass breaking, and with a synced Ring Alarm, Astro can also move autonomously to triggered sensors to investigate. Virtual Security Guard: For even more protection, adding a Virtual Security Guard subscription lets Rapid Response agents respond when Astro is in Home or Away mode. For example, if Astro detects an unrecognized person, hears the sound of glass breaking or a smoke or CO alarm, or receives an alert that a Ring Alarm sensor has been triggered, agents are alerted. The agents can then initiate Astro’s live view and remotely navigate the device to investigate further, and if needed, call emergency services.

Over the past year, customers have been testing Astro for Business across a range of businesses, including retail, manufacturing, health and wellness, food and beverage, and construction, and they have quickly adopted it as a reliable security service.

“Having Astro in my business has been invaluable—it is a security camera on steroids,” said pilot participant James Mahon, president at Southern Oregon Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. “It moves quickly around the warehouse, and you can see when a forklift has been left in a dangerous position or if a door is unlocked. We even had a rear door blown open during a windstorm, and with Astro for Business, I was able to see it live, cancel police dispatch, and head down to close the door myself.”

Chris Adkins, manager at Louisville Office Furniture, said, “I like that Astro has the ability to check on potential issues in real time and prevents the need to have cameras throughout my business. Even when there is no event, Astro has the capability to investigate in a way that traditional security devices can’t. This is a viable option to provide security for my business.”

“Having Astro has helped me sleep better at night,” said Jonathan Hebel, chief operating officer of Hapa Group. “We use industrial ovens that, if not turned off properly, can easily start a fire. I used to drive back to the office at all hours if I wasn’t confident they were shut down. Now with Astro, I’m able to check in via live view and triple-check that the ovens are off at any time—whether it’s 6 p.m. or 2 a.m.”

Customers can control Astro by using the Amazon Astro app, making it easy to check in remotely, communicate with employees, change patrol frequencies, and arm and disarm Astro.

Astro is built with multiple layers of privacy controls. Astro for Business does not retain voice recordings, and customers can easily turn off mics, cameras, and motion with one press of a button, as well as define out-of-bounds zones where Astro is not allowed to patrol.

Pricing and availability

Astro for Business is available for purchase today starting at $2,349.99. At purchase, customers will receive a free four-month trial of Ring Protect Pro ($20/month) and Astro Secure ($60/month), a $320 value. If subscribed to both Ring Protect Pro and Astro Secure, customers can also add Virtual Security Guard for $99/month. Astro for Business is only available in the U.S."
2022-11-15, Investing.com,"Futures inch higher, Target to report - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-inch-higher-target-to-report--whats-moving-markets-3902313,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch up on Wednesday, after the main indices on Wall Street soared in the prior session on optimism that slower-than-projected inflation data may lead the Federal Reserve to end its long-standing policy tightening campaign. Meanwhile, Target (NYSE: ) gears up to release its latest quarterly results and industrial activity in China grows at a faster than expected pace in October.

1. Futures tick higher

U.S. stock futures pointed into the green on Wednesday, as investors digested the implications of a softer-than-anticipated October inflation reading on Federal Reserve interest rate policy and looked ahead to more earnings from major retail chains this week.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract had added 46 points or 0.1%, had risen by 9 points or 0.2%, and had climbed by 50 points or 0.3%.

The three indices finished sharply higher in the previous session after Labor Department figures showed that price growth in the world's largest economy had slowed by more than expected to 3.2% on an annualized basis last month. The data boosted hopes that the Fed's unprecedented run of interest rate hikes aimed at corralling elevated inflation may have peaked.

In their best day since April, the benchmark and tech-heavy moved up by 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively. The 30-stock also gained 1.4%.

Market expectations that the Fed could now cut rates as soon as May of next year increased, while the chance of a reduction in March now stands at around 30%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool . The rate-sensitive is at 4.853% following a 22 basis-point overnight decline. Yields typically move inversely to prices.

2. Target to report latest earnings

Target is due to publish its third-quarter results on Wednesday, in a release that could provide a fresh glimpse into the outlook for consumer spending heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.

The big-box retailer is seen posting a 5.22% slide in comparable same store sales during the period, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Minneapolis-based Target is also projected to forecast a 4.75% slip in the figure in its current quarter.

In August, the company slashed its full-year sales and profit expectations, saying it is taking a ""cautious approach"" to the second half of 2022. Target, which typically sells more non-essential items like electronics and patio furniture, has been attempting to expand its daily use offerings to entice inflation-squeezed customers reining in spending on big-ticket products.

Any guidance on price pressures from from Target executives will likely be in focus. On Tuesday, peer Home Depot (NYSE: ) said that while consumers are still avoiding large purchases in favor of smaller projects, it believes that ""the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us.""

3. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway) exits positions in some blue-chip stocks

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) exited its stake in a number of big-name publicly-listed U.S. businesses, including healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and carmaker General Motors (NYSE: ), according to a closely-watched filing on Tuesday.

It also eliminated smaller positions in logistics firm United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), and Oreo-owner Mondelez International (NASDAQ: ), while slimming down its ownership of oil major Chevron (NYSE: ) and e-commerce firm Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), among others.

The cuts helped swell Berkshire's total stock sales this year through September to a net $23.6 billion, versus net purchases of $48.9B in the corresponding period in 2022. At the end of September, its cash pile was at a record high of $157B, thanks in part to higher interest on its Treasury and cash holdings.

Investors normally keep tabs on Berkshire's moves to gain insight into how Buffett, who is widely revered for his storied career of stock-picking, viewed recent market movements.

4. Chinese industrial production outpaces forecasts in October

Chinese industrial output grew by more than expected in October, while retail sales also rose above expectations, bolstering hopes for a recovery in sluggish post-pandemic demand in the world's second largest economy.

expanded by 4.6% in October from the prior year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was faster than projections of 4.4%, and up slightly from 4.5% in September.

also increased by 7.6%, beating expectations for a rise of 7.0%, thanks largely to a boost from the Golden Week holiday at the beginning of the month.

Local consumption in October was supported by several liquidity measures undertaken by Beijing, while comparable figures in the prior year were also stymied by the last throes of the government's strict COVID-era policies.

But an overall economic rebound in China remained tenuous, especially as business activity last month still pointed to sustained weakness.

5. Oil slips with U.S. inventories data ahead

Oil prices edged down on Wednesday after the previous session's gains on the back of signs of cooling U.S. inflation.

By 05:01 ET, the futures traded 0.4% lower at $77.92 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $82.17 per barrel.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its first oil inventory report in two weeks in the session, after a systems upgrade last week. Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute published on Tuesday pointed to a weekly build of just over one million barrels in inventories."

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Consumer discretionary shares hit highs on subdued inflation data,https://in.investing.com/news/consumer-discretionary-shares-hit-highs-on-subdued-inflation-data-93CH-3901782,"NEW YORK - On Tuesday, a wave of optimism swept through the consumer discretionary sector as subdued inflation data prompted investors to rally behind shares in the segment, propelling them to notable highs. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA: XLY), which tracks this segment of the market, surged to a two-month peak, reflecting a broader market response to the latest economic indicators.

The ETF saw its value climb by 1.5% following the release of the inflation figures, a significant jump from the 0.5% increase observed before the data went public. This uptick is indicative of investor confidence that cooler inflation could stave off aggressive interest rate hikes, potentially fostering an environment conducive to consumer spending.

Major companies within the sector also felt a positive impact. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) both reached new heights, with Tesla stock hitting a one-month high and Amazon shares soaring to a 19-month high. Ford Motor Co . (NYSE: NYSE: ) similarly saw its share value rise, although specific figures were not disclosed.

The optimism wasn't limited to just discretionary spending stocks. Firms in the consumer staples sector, which tend to be less sensitive to economic shifts, also enjoyed gains. Retail giants Walmart Inc. (NYSE: NYSE: ), Target Corp. (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) all reported modest increases in their share values, underscoring the broad-based nature of the positive market sentiment.

The ripple effect of the encouraging inflation data extended beyond individual stocks and sectors. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: NYSE: ), a barometer for the overall market performance, advanced by 1.3% post-data announcement from an earlier gain of just 0.1%, signaling a robust start to trading that could set the tone for market dynamics in the near term.

Investors are likely to keep a close watch on consumer trends and Federal Reserve policy moves in light of these developments, which could have significant implications for market trajectories moving forward.

(NYSE: ) experienced a share price increase for the second consecutive day, showcasing resilience in a market that saw mixed performances among major players.

“After further evaluation of our businesses, it became clear that we need to focus our resources and efforts to deliver great games to players now and in the future,” Hartmann wrote in the memo.

In April this year, Amazon laid off more than 100 employees across its gaming divisions that include Prime Gaming, Game Growth and Amazon Games.

According to Hartmann, after the initial restructuring in April, “it became clear that we needed to focus our resources even more on the areas that are growing with the highest potential to drive our business forward”.

“With these changes in our business approach come changes to our resourcing, resulting in the elimination of just over 180 roles,” the Amazon executive informed.

The company is working to ensure all impacted employees are given the support they need on an individual level, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits and more.

In March, Amazon announced to lay off another 9,000 employees in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Twitch, advertising, and HR. Amazon initially eliminated 18,000 positions in January.

2022-11-13, Investing.com,BofA's take on Amazon's latest grocery delivery announcement,https://in.investing.com/news/bofas-take-on-amazons-latest-grocery-delivery-announcement-432SI-3900764,"In a recent report, Bank of America Securities provided its perspective on Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) announcement late last week. The e-commerce giant is expanding its grocery delivery services to include non-Prime members. This initiative, integrating Amazon Fresh and soon Whole Foods, extends two-hour delivery to over 3,500 cities across the U.S.

Previously exclusive to Prime members, the service now allows free delivery for orders over $100. Amazon is also widening its selection by including local grocers and specialty shops such as Bristol Farms, Cardenas Markets, and Weis Markets.

After spending 2022 recalibrating its grocery strategy, Amazon's recent changes, including reducing the free delivery threshold in October, signals the company may have improved delivery economics to a point where a $100 order can be closer to breakeven, according to analysts at BofA.

This year, Amazon has reported substantial growth in U.S. retail margins, increasing by 550 basis points year-over-year as it emerges from an extensive COVID-related investment cycle exceeding $100 billion. Market analysts express a cautious outlook, anticipating the possibility of a new cycle. “So far, Amazon’s grocery investment appears to be more measured, as the company seems to have a regional approach and is actively refining the economics of its store formats before making a bigger national push,” commented the analysts at BofA.

Additionally, Amazon's partnership with local grocers is expected to mitigate some of the investment demands for building supply chains and infrastructure, although analysts at BofA anticipate limited large grocer participation with Amazon given long-term competitive risk.

Analysts at BofA maintained its Buy rating and $168 price target on Amazon as they see grocery as an important driver of Amazon’s growth over the next 5 years, alongside its B2B initiatives."

It also plans to add Drive Up canopies to 200 stores, enhancing the customer experience for those who opt for this service. Additionally, Target's focus on developing and promoting owned brands like Good & Gather reflects its commitment to offering quality products at competitive prices, which is expected to support profitability and potential margin growth.

Target's ability to reinvent itself in the face of stiff competition from e-commerce platforms and big-box retailers demonstrates its agility and foresight.

The company reported a 28% annual revenue increase in its first post-IPO earnings report on Wednesday. However, shares fell by over 7% due to lower-than-expected revenue guidance.

Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, Arm achieved breakthrough success when the Arm610 processor powered Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Newton device in 1993. Today, it licenses its architecture to CPU manufacturers and collects royalties from each chip shipped with its technology. Despite a slump in smartphone sales and geopolitical risks with China, which accounts for 20% of its revenue, Arm is making strides in the laptop market through a partnership with Apple and is experiencing growth in the automotive industry due to the rise of self-driving capabilities and partnerships with companies like Cruise.

In response to the global chip shortage highlighting Arm's critical role in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) announced its latest Grace Hopper Superchip. This couples Nvidia's GPUs with Arm's Neoverse cores, underscoring Arm's influence in high-performance computing.

Arm is also involved in a legal dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) over chip production rights following Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Furthermore, there is significant controversy surrounding Arm China, an independent entity majority-owned by Chinese investors embroiled in a leadership dispute. Former Arm China employees have started a new internal chip design company with backing from Shenzhen's government.

Despite these challenges, Arm has diversified into emerging markets including AI and has launched its Neoverse line for high-performance and cloud computing applications. The company has partnerships with major tech companies including Apple, Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). However, a labor shortage at TSMC is affecting its $40 billion fab under construction.

Arm's primary competitor remains Intel's x86 architecture. However, software componentization is making it easier for other architectures like Arm to run on servers. It also faces competition from RISC-V, an open-source rival architecture gaining traction among key customers like Google and Samsung.

Despite a failed acquisition attempt by Nvidia and challenges such as declining smartphone sales, Arm continues to evolve and is positioning itself as a crucial player in the future of computing.

2022-11-16, Investing.com,Goldman Sachs highlights seven tech giants as market leaders,https://in.investing.com/news/goldman-sachs-highlights-seven-tech-giants-as-market-leaders-93CH-3904267,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) has spotlighted a group of seven technology stocks, known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), for their standout financial performance and strong balance sheets. These companies are expected to continue leading the market into the next year due to their ability to reinvest and drive superior financial results.

Chief U.S. Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, David Kostin, has identified these tech giants as critical players in the stock market. They are often referred to by financial acronyms and are benchmarked against a specific index to track their collective performance.

In the backdrop of a resilient economy with a robust labor market and cooling inflation, Goldman Sachs offers an optimistic outlook. The unemployment rate was recorded at 3.9% in October, with a year-on-year price increase standing at 3.2%. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs forecasts a GDP growth of 2.4% for 2022 and expects similar growth of 2.1% in 2024.

The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is anticipated to shift towards gradual rate cuts in the second half of 2024, with Hatzius assigning a 15% chance of recession within the next 12 months. The is projected to see moderate growth, ending at 4,700 next year, marking a 5% increase.

Kostin recommends focusing on quality stocks as a high-conviction investment approach and predicts modest earnings growth of 5% for both 2024 and 2025. Profit margins are likely to maintain stability during this period. The normalization of supply-demand imbalances that arose during the COVID pandemic has contributed to lower inflation while sustaining satisfactory GDP growth. Currently, the S&P 500 trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18; however, on an equal-weighted basis, this ratio drops to 14.

This financial assessment by Goldman Sachs underscores the enduring strength and potential resilience of these leading tech companies amidst economic uncertainties.

The announcement was made today at the 2022 Los Angeles Auto Show and a livestream can be viewed here: https://youtube.com/live/Qzhq1tShTMc. This strategic collaboration includes Amazon launching online sale of Hyundai vehicles in the U.S. in 2024, Hyundai naming AWS as its preferred cloud provider to help facilitate digital transformation, and the Alexa Built-in experience coming to Hyundai’s next-generation vehicles.

“Hyundai is a very innovative company that shares Amazon’s passion for trying to make customers’ lives better and easier every day,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. “Our broad, strategic partnership should do just that, from changing the ease with which customers can buy vehicles online, to making it simple to use Alexa in Hyundai vehicles for entertainment, shopping, smart home adjustments, and calendar checks, to enabling Hyundai to transform their customer experiences and business operations by moving to AWS. We look forward to inventing together for many years.”

“Partnering with one of the world’s most customer-centric organizations unlocks incredible opportunities as we continue to expand our portfolio, grow our sales network, transition to electrification and realize the future of smart mobility,” said President and CEO of Hyundai Motor (OTC: ) Company Jaehoon (Jay) Chang. “Amazon is the ideal partner to help realize our vision of progress for humanity, including improving how people and goods move more efficiently and sustainably. Hyundai is the first automotive company available for full end-to-end transactions in Amazon’s U.S. store and this is another example of how we continue to push for ways to elevate the customer journey together with our outstanding retail partners.”

Some more details around what Amazon and Hyundai are announcing today include:

Vehicle Sales: In 2024, auto dealers for the first time will be able to sell vehicles in Amazon’s U.S. store, and Hyundai will be the first brand available for customers to purchase. This new digital shopping experience will make it easy for customers to purchase a new car online, and then pick it up or have it delivered by their local dealership at a time that works best for them. Customers will be able to search on Amazon for available vehicles in their area based on a range of preferences, including model, trim, color, and features, choose their preferred car, and then check out online with their chosen payment and financing options—all within the Amazon experience they already know and trust. This new shopping experience will create another way for dealers to build awareness of their selection and offer convenience to their customers.

Cloud Transformation: Hyundai has selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider to accelerate its digital transformation using broad and industry-leading AWS capabilities—from compute, storage, database, and analytics to generative AI and Internet of Things (IoT). As part of a new multiyear agreement, Hyundai will become a more data-driven organization with a cloud-first technology strategy, migrating its current on-premises applications—which support everything across research, product engineering, and customer engagement—to AWS. Hyundai will prioritize business cases like manufacturing and supply chain to help optimize production and minimize costs, security and disaster recovery for resiliency, and connected vehicle development to bring new features to drivers around the globe. AWS and Hyundai have designed and implemented a Master Builder training and certification program to train Hyundai engineers in critical cloud skills.

In-Vehicle Solutions: Starting in 2025, customers who purchase Hyundai’s next-generation vehicles will be able to access the hands-free Alexa experience they have at home, while in their car. Hyundai drivers will be able to simply ask Alexa to play music, podcasts, or audiobooks, set reminders, update to-do lists, and check calendars. Customers will also be able to control their smart home from the road, such as asking to warm up the house on their way home, double-checking doors are locked, and managing smart lighting and Alexa routines. Drivers will also be able to ask Alexa for up-to-date traffic updates or weather reports and voice-control the in-vehicle media player or navigation system—with certain Alexa features accessible even when internet connectivity is intermittent or not available."
2022-11-16, Investing.com,Tech sector defies rate hikes with AI-driven surge,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-defies-rate-hikes-with-aidriven-surge-93CH-3903947,"NEW YORK - The tech sector has demonstrated remarkable tenacity in 2022, rallying impressively despite the Federal Reserve's significant interest rate increases. This year, the S&P 500’s Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLK) experienced a substantial 46.5% boost as of November 15, primarily driven by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI).

The Federal Reserve has been on a campaign to tighten monetary policy, raising interest rates by a total of 525 basis points since March 2022. The current benchmark interest rate sits between 5.25% and 5.5%. Historically, such hikes tend to dampen growth in sectors like technology due to increased borrowing costs. However, tech stocks have shown a surprising ability to bounce back from periodic dips. This resilience is highlighted by the 's impressive year-to-year climb of 34.8%.

Major players in the tech industry, including Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), have played a pivotal role in the S&P 500’s overall rise of 17.3% year to date.

The momentum for tech stocks saw a resurgence in November following the Federal Reserve's decision during its last FOMC meeting to maintain interest rates for the second time in a row.

Investors are now optimistic as expectations mount over cooling inflation, suggesting that the central bank may pivot away from its current hawkish stance and potentially start reducing interest rates in 2024. This anticipated shift is seen as beneficial for the tech sector.

In light of these developments, certain tech sector funds are gaining attention for their strong performance and investment potential. Funds such as the Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (NASDAQ:FSELX), Columbia Seligman Technology and Information Fund (NASDAQ:SLMCX), and T. Rowe Price Science & Tech Fund (NASDAQ:PRSCX) come highly recommended due to their impressive track records. These funds also boast strong Zacks Mutual Fund rankings, are accessible with reasonable minimum initial investment amounts, and offer competitive low expense ratios, making them attractive options for investors looking to capitalize on the tech sector's robust performance amidst a challenging economic environment shaped by high interest rates.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,BlackRock warns of low thematic growth exposure in U.S. portfolios,https://in.investing.com/news/blackrock-warns-of-low-thematic-growth-exposure-in-us-portfolios-93CH-3902798,"NEW YORK - BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager, has issued a warning to investors regarding the perceived adequacy of their thematic growth exposure through major technology stocks. Jay Jacobs, a senior executive at BlackRock, highlighted that many U.S. wealth investors might be underestimating their portfolios' actual exposure to transformative themes like artificial intelligence (AI), medical innovation, and the changing landscape of globalization.

According to BlackRock's 2024 Thematic Outlook Report, most investments in AI come from the large-cap tech firms known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which includes Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ). However, the report underscores that no theme has more than 1.5% pure-play exposure, suggesting that investors relying solely on these megacap stocks may not have significant investment in these key areas.

To better capture the next wave of growth in AI, Jacobs recommends diversifying into specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) and the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA: IRBO) are noted for their potential to tap into AI advancements. Jacobs predicts that significant growth opportunities will arise within small and mid-cap companies in this space. Additionally, the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (NYSEARCA: IHAK) is identified as being closely tied to the AI theme.

In terms of globalization trends, Jacobs points out that Mexico has recently surpassed China and Canada to become the largest trade partner with the United States. To capitalize on this shift, he suggests considering investments in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA: EWW) and the iShares MSCI India ETF (NYSEARCA: INDA).

The medical innovation sector is also undergoing significant changes due to demographic shifts in the U.S., with the population hitting ""peak 65"" and experiencing what BlackRock calls a 'Historical Reversal'. To engage with this theme, BlackRock has identified several funds including the BlackRock Future Health ETF (BMED), iShares Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), and iShares Neuroscience and Healthcare ETF (NASDAQ: IBRN).

Investors are being urged to reassess their portfolios to ensure they are not overlooking opportunities for thematic growth beyond the dominant tech giants. By considering a broader range of targeted ETFs, they may be able to achieve a more robust exposure to these burgeoning sectors.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,Amazon Announces Astro for Business,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-announces-astro-for-business-432SI-3902782,"Amazon (AMZN) today announced Astro for Business, a security solution for small and medium-sized businesses that combines robotics, smart security, and artificial intelligence (AI). Customers can tailor Astro for Business with separately sold subscriptions that each provide incremental benefits when layered on top of each other. This includes Ring Protect Pro and Astro Secure, a new subscription offering advanced business security features, like smart alerts, custom patrol routes, and scheduled patrols. Customers can also add Virtual Security Guard for additional professional monitoring capabilities. From checking in after hours to having Astro patrol and send alerts if something is amiss, Astro for Business gives business owners eyes in more places and peace of mind knowing that they can better protect their business.

“Security continues to be a headache for business owners. According to the National Retail Federation, businesses have faced losses of nearly $100 billion in 2022. But traditional security solutions can be too static or expensive for what businesses need. We think Astro for Business can help with that,” said Anthony Robson, head of product for Amazon Astro. “We have been testing Astro in a variety of businesses and have seen firsthand how Astro’s intelligent motion helped provide visibility on blind spots and areas that existing stationary cameras couldn’t see, giving business owners peace of mind because their inventory and property are protected, even when they aren’t there.”

Astro for Business is designed to give customers eyes on their business 24/7, even after they’ve gone home for the night. It can map up to 5,000 square feet, and customers can use live view, two-way talk, Astro’s HD periscope camera with night vision, and visual ID to receive unrecognized person smart alerts. Additional subscriptions offer enhanced security benefits when layered on top of each other.

Ring Protect Pro: Subscribing to Ring Protect Pro lets customers save Astro for Business video history for up to 180 days and sync Astro for Business with Ring Alarm to link Ring Motion Detectors and window and door Ring Alarm Contact Sensors for alerts when a Ring Alarm is triggered.

Subscribing to Ring Protect Pro lets customers save Astro for Business video history for up to 180 days and sync Astro for Business with Ring Alarm to link Ring Motion Detectors and window and door Ring Alarm Contact Sensors for alerts when a Ring Alarm is triggered. Astro Secure: A new subscription built specifically for business environments that enables Astro to patrol autonomously and lets customers create multiple security monitoring routes tailored to their business, with specific viewpoints and frequencies. Astro can also send customers smart alerts when it hears the sounds of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms or glass breaking, and with a synced Ring Alarm, Astro can also move autonomously to triggered sensors to investigate.

Astro can also send customers smart alerts when it hears the sounds of smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms or glass breaking, and with a synced Ring Alarm, Astro can also move autonomously to triggered sensors to investigate. Virtual Security Guard: For even more protection, adding a Virtual Security Guard subscription lets Rapid Response agents respond when Astro is in Home or Away mode. For example, if Astro detects an unrecognized person, hears the sound of glass breaking or a smoke or CO alarm, or receives an alert that a Ring Alarm sensor has been triggered, agents are alerted. The agents can then initiate Astro’s live view and remotely navigate the device to investigate further, and if needed, call emergency services.

Over the past year, customers have been testing Astro for Business across a range of businesses, including retail, manufacturing, health and wellness, food and beverage, and construction, and they have quickly adopted it as a reliable security service.

“Having Astro in my business has been invaluable—it is a security camera on steroids,” said pilot participant James Mahon, president at Southern Oregon Heating & Air Conditioning, Inc. “It moves quickly around the warehouse, and you can see when a forklift has been left in a dangerous position or if a door is unlocked. We even had a rear door blown open during a windstorm, and with Astro for Business, I was able to see it live, cancel police dispatch, and head down to close the door myself.”

Chris Adkins, manager at Louisville Office Furniture, said, “I like that Astro has the ability to check on potential issues in real time and prevents the need to have cameras throughout my business. Even when there is no event, Astro has the capability to investigate in a way that traditional security devices can’t. This is a viable option to provide security for my business.”

“Having Astro has helped me sleep better at night,” said Jonathan Hebel, chief operating officer of Hapa Group. “We use industrial ovens that, if not turned off properly, can easily start a fire. I used to drive back to the office at all hours if I wasn’t confident they were shut down. Now with Astro, I’m able to check in via live view and triple-check that the ovens are off at any time—whether it’s 6 p.m. or 2 a.m.”

Customers can control Astro by using the Amazon Astro app, making it easy to check in remotely, communicate with employees, change patrol frequencies, and arm and disarm Astro.

Astro is built with multiple layers of privacy controls. Astro for Business does not retain voice recordings, and customers can easily turn off mics, cameras, and motion with one press of a button, as well as define out-of-bounds zones where Astro is not allowed to patrol.

Pricing and availability

Astro for Business is available for purchase today starting at $2,349.99. At purchase, customers will receive a free four-month trial of Ring Protect Pro ($20/month) and Astro Secure ($60/month), a $320 value. If subscribed to both Ring Protect Pro and Astro Secure, customers can also add Virtual Security Guard for $99/month. Astro for Business is only available in the U.S."
2022-11-15, Investing.com,"Futures inch higher, Target to report - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-inch-higher-target-to-report--whats-moving-markets-3902313,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch up on Wednesday, after the main indices on Wall Street soared in the prior session on optimism that slower-than-projected inflation data may lead the Federal Reserve to end its long-standing policy tightening campaign. Meanwhile, Target (NYSE: ) gears up to release its latest quarterly results and industrial activity in China grows at a faster than expected pace in October.

1. Futures tick higher

U.S. stock futures pointed into the green on Wednesday, as investors digested the implications of a softer-than-anticipated October inflation reading on Federal Reserve interest rate policy and looked ahead to more earnings from major retail chains this week.

By 05:00 ET (10:00 GMT), the contract had added 46 points or 0.1%, had risen by 9 points or 0.2%, and had climbed by 50 points or 0.3%.

The three indices finished sharply higher in the previous session after Labor Department figures showed that price growth in the world's largest economy had slowed by more than expected to 3.2% on an annualized basis last month. The data boosted hopes that the Fed's unprecedented run of interest rate hikes aimed at corralling elevated inflation may have peaked.

In their best day since April, the benchmark and tech-heavy moved up by 1.9% and 2.4%, respectively. The 30-stock also gained 1.4%.

Market expectations that the Fed could now cut rates as soon as May of next year increased, while the chance of a reduction in March now stands at around 30%, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool . The rate-sensitive is at 4.853% following a 22 basis-point overnight decline. Yields typically move inversely to prices.

2. Target to report latest earnings

Target is due to publish its third-quarter results on Wednesday, in a release that could provide a fresh glimpse into the outlook for consumer spending heading into the crucial holiday shopping season.

The big-box retailer is seen posting a 5.22% slide in comparable same store sales during the period, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Minneapolis-based Target is also projected to forecast a 4.75% slip in the figure in its current quarter.

In August, the company slashed its full-year sales and profit expectations, saying it is taking a ""cautious approach"" to the second half of 2022. Target, which typically sells more non-essential items like electronics and patio furniture, has been attempting to expand its daily use offerings to entice inflation-squeezed customers reining in spending on big-ticket products.

Any guidance on price pressures from from Target executives will likely be in focus. On Tuesday, peer Home Depot (NYSE: ) said that while consumers are still avoiding large purchases in favor of smaller projects, it believes that ""the worst of the inflationary environment is behind us.""

3. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway) exits positions in some blue-chip stocks

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) exited its stake in a number of big-name publicly-listed U.S. businesses, including healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and carmaker General Motors (NYSE: ), according to a closely-watched filing on Tuesday.

It also eliminated smaller positions in logistics firm United Parcel Service (NYSE: ), consumer goods corporation Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), and Oreo-owner Mondelez International (NASDAQ: ), while slimming down its ownership of oil major Chevron (NYSE: ) and e-commerce firm Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), among others.

The cuts helped swell Berkshire's total stock sales this year through September to a net $23.6 billion, versus net purchases of $48.9B in the corresponding period in 2022. At the end of September, its cash pile was at a record high of $157B, thanks in part to higher interest on its Treasury and cash holdings.

Investors normally keep tabs on Berkshire's moves to gain insight into how Buffett, who is widely revered for his storied career of stock-picking, viewed recent market movements.

4. Chinese industrial production outpaces forecasts in October

Chinese industrial output grew by more than expected in October, while retail sales also rose above expectations, bolstering hopes for a recovery in sluggish post-pandemic demand in the world's second largest economy.

expanded by 4.6% in October from the prior year, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was faster than projections of 4.4%, and up slightly from 4.5% in September.

also increased by 7.6%, beating expectations for a rise of 7.0%, thanks largely to a boost from the Golden Week holiday at the beginning of the month.

Local consumption in October was supported by several liquidity measures undertaken by Beijing, while comparable figures in the prior year were also stymied by the last throes of the government's strict COVID-era policies.

But an overall economic rebound in China remained tenuous, especially as business activity last month still pointed to sustained weakness.

5. Oil slips with U.S. inventories data ahead

Oil prices edged down on Wednesday after the previous session's gains on the back of signs of cooling U.S. inflation.

By 05:01 ET, the futures traded 0.4% lower at $77.92 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $82.17 per barrel.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its first oil inventory report in two weeks in the session, after a systems upgrade last week. Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute published on Tuesday pointed to a weekly build of just over one million barrels in inventories."

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Consumer discretionary shares hit highs on subdued inflation data,https://in.investing.com/news/consumer-discretionary-shares-hit-highs-on-subdued-inflation-data-93CH-3901782,"NEW YORK - On Tuesday, a wave of optimism swept through the consumer discretionary sector as subdued inflation data prompted investors to rally behind shares in the segment, propelling them to notable highs. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF (NYSEARCA: XLY), which tracks this segment of the market, surged to a two-month peak, reflecting a broader market response to the latest economic indicators.

The ETF saw its value climb by 1.5% following the release of the inflation figures, a significant jump from the 0.5% increase observed before the data went public. This uptick is indicative of investor confidence that cooler inflation could stave off aggressive interest rate hikes, potentially fostering an environment conducive to consumer spending.

Major companies within the sector also felt a positive impact. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) both reached new heights, with Tesla stock hitting a one-month high and Amazon shares soaring to a 19-month high. Ford Motor Co . (NYSE: NYSE: ) similarly saw its share value rise, although specific figures were not disclosed.

The optimism wasn't limited to just discretionary spending stocks. Firms in the consumer staples sector, which tend to be less sensitive to economic shifts, also enjoyed gains. Retail giants Walmart Inc. (NYSE: NYSE: ), Target Corp. (NYSE: NYSE: ), and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) all reported modest increases in their share values, underscoring the broad-based nature of the positive market sentiment.

The ripple effect of the encouraging inflation data extended beyond individual stocks and sectors. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA: NYSE: ), a barometer for the overall market performance, advanced by 1.3% post-data announcement from an earlier gain of just 0.1%, signaling a robust start to trading that could set the tone for market dynamics in the near term.

Investors are likely to keep a close watch on consumer trends and Federal Reserve policy moves in light of these developments, which could have significant implications for market trajectories moving forward.

“After further evaluation of our businesses, it became clear that we need to focus our resources and efforts to deliver great games to players now and in the future,” Hartmann wrote in the memo.

In April this year, Amazon laid off more than 100 employees across its gaming divisions that include Prime Gaming, Game Growth and Amazon Games.

According to Hartmann, after the initial restructuring in April, “it became clear that we needed to focus our resources even more on the areas that are growing with the highest potential to drive our business forward”.

“With these changes in our business approach come changes to our resourcing, resulting in the elimination of just over 180 roles,” the Amazon executive informed.

The company is working to ensure all impacted employees are given the support they need on an individual level, including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits and more.

“I recognise that this is the second time this year that you are hearing about org-wide team changes and seeing colleagues go, so let me be very clear when I say this: I remain confident in our future,” Hartmann wrote.

“We are developing and publishing great games with high potential, our studio teams are growing, and our roadmap is bright,” the executive added.

In March, Amazon announced to lay off another 9,000 employees in Amazon Web Services (AWS), Twitch, advertising, and HR. Amazon initially eliminated 18,000 positions in January.

2022-11-13, Investing.com,BofA's take on Amazon's latest grocery delivery announcement,https://in.investing.com/news/bofas-take-on-amazons-latest-grocery-delivery-announcement-432SI-3900764,"In a recent report, Bank of America Securities provided its perspective on Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) announcement late last week. The e-commerce giant is expanding its grocery delivery services to include non-Prime members. This initiative, integrating Amazon Fresh and soon Whole Foods, extends two-hour delivery to over 3,500 cities across the U.S.

Previously exclusive to Prime members, the service now allows free delivery for orders over $100. Amazon is also widening its selection by including local grocers and specialty shops such as Bristol Farms, Cardenas Markets, and Weis Markets.

After spending 2022 recalibrating its grocery strategy, Amazon's recent changes, including reducing the free delivery threshold in October, signals the company may have improved delivery economics to a point where a $100 order can be closer to breakeven, according to analysts at BofA.

This year, Amazon has reported substantial growth in U.S. retail margins, increasing by 550 basis points year-over-year as it emerges from an extensive COVID-related investment cycle exceeding $100 billion. Market analysts express a cautious outlook, anticipating the possibility of a new cycle. “So far, Amazon’s grocery investment appears to be more measured, as the company seems to have a regional approach and is actively refining the economics of its store formats before making a bigger national push,” commented the analysts at BofA.

Additionally, Amazon's partnership with local grocers is expected to mitigate some of the investment demands for building supply chains and infrastructure, although analysts at BofA anticipate limited large grocer participation with Amazon given long-term competitive risk.

Analysts at BofA maintained its Buy rating and $168 price target on Amazon as they see grocery as an important driver of Amazon’s growth over the next 5 years, alongside its B2B initiatives."

The company has successfully integrated its physical stores with digital capabilities, offering customers a hybrid shopping experience that includes both in-store visits and online orders with the option of curbside pickup. This strategic shift, which has been a decade in the making, is central to Target's future growth plans.

The company's transformation has been driven by the need to adapt to a rapidly changing retail landscape, where e-commerce has become increasingly dominant. Target has responded by leveraging its brick-and-mortar presence, enhancing the customer experience with the addition of amenities like in-house Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) locations. These efforts have helped Target maintain its relevance in an industry where many traditional retailers have struggled.

During the pandemic, Target saw a surge in its Pickup, Drive Up, and Shipt sales as consumers looked for safer and more convenient ways to shop. However, the post-pandemic period brought new challenges, with behavioral changes leading to excess inventory and lower profit margins. Despite these hurdles and a recent sell-off in its shares, Target has continued to innovate.

The retailer has undertaken operational improvements such as reconfiguring stores to better accommodate Drive Up services. It also plans to add Drive Up canopies to 200 stores, enhancing the customer experience for those who opt for this service. Additionally, Target's focus on developing and promoting owned brands like Good & Gather reflects its commitment to offering quality products at competitive prices, which is expected to support profitability and potential margin growth.

Target's ability to reinvent itself in the face of stiff competition from e-commerce platforms and big-box retailers demonstrates its agility and foresight. The company's blend of digital and traditional retail strategies positions it well to navigate the evolving retail landscape and continue serving customers in effective and innovative ways.

InvestingPro Insights

Despite a declining trend in earnings per share, the company remains a prominent player in the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry.

Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, England, Arm achieved breakthrough success when the Arm610 processor powered Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Newton device in 1993. Today, it licenses its architecture to CPU manufacturers and collects royalties from each chip shipped with its technology. Despite a slump in smartphone sales and geopolitical risks with China, which accounts for 20% of its revenue, Arm is making strides in the laptop market through a partnership with Apple and is experiencing growth in the automotive industry due to the rise of self-driving capabilities and partnerships with companies like Cruise.

In response to the global chip shortage highlighting Arm's critical role in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) announced its latest Grace Hopper Superchip. This couples Nvidia's GPUs with Arm's Neoverse cores, underscoring Arm's influence in high-performance computing.

Arm is also involved in a legal dispute with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) over chip production rights following Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia in 2021. Furthermore, there is significant controversy surrounding Arm China, an independent entity majority-owned by Chinese investors embroiled in a leadership dispute. Former Arm China employees have started a new internal chip design company with backing from Shenzhen's government.

Despite these challenges, Arm has diversified into emerging markets including AI and has launched its Neoverse line for high-performance and cloud computing applications. The company has partnerships with major tech companies including Apple, Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Samsung (KS: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). However, a labor shortage at TSMC is affecting its $40 billion fab under construction.

Arm's primary competitor remains Intel's x86 architecture. However, software componentization is making it easier for other architectures like Arm to run on servers. It also faces competition from RISC-V, an open-source rival architecture gaining traction among key customers like Google and Samsung.

Despite a failed acquisition attempt by Nvidia and challenges such as declining smartphone sales, Arm continues to evolve and is positioning itself as a crucial player in the future of computing.

This service expansion, previously available only to Prime members, makes it easier for all customers to get their grocery needs met both in-store and online.

“We’re always looking for ways to make grocery shopping easy, fast, and affordable for all of our customers. Now, all customers can order groceries online for delivery or pickup from Amazon Fresh across the U.S., with Whole Foods Market coming soon – even if they don’t have a Prime membership,” said Claire Peters, Vice President, Amazon Fresh. “This marks another step in Amazon’s journey to build a best-in-class grocery shopping experience offering incredible selection, value, and convenience.”

The company also announced that Amazon customers can now order delivery from a variety of local grocery and specialty retailers available on Amazon.com, including Bristol Farms, Cardenas Markets, Pet Food Express, Weis Markets, and Save Mart. Amazon will also soon expand its grocery delivery and free pickup where available from Whole Foods Market to customers without a Prime membership. Once fully launched across all Whole Foods Market locations, customers in more than 3,500 cities and towns across the U.S. will have access to two-hour grocery delivery from Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods Market.

Prime members will continue to save while grocery shopping with exclusive discounts and offers on qualifying items, both in-store and online at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market. This includes savings on delivery fees, like free shipping on Amazon Fresh delivery orders over $100.

With this delivery expansion, customers have even more options to get what they need, when they need it, from Amazon’s grocery offerings. They can choose to supplement their in-store grocery shopping with delivery orders, or shop from a selection online and pick up items in-store—all on top of free Amazon package pickup and returns at the company’s convenient in-store counters.

Bringing re-imagined Amazon Fresh stores to Los Angeles

Amazon already has a large online grocery business and millions of products available for fast delivery. The next step is continuing to build out the company’s physical presence. Since Amazon completed the redesign of two Amazon Fresh stores in the Chicago area, customers have shared they are enjoying the benefits from the updates that have been made. More than 90% of local customers who shopped in Amazon’s redesigned stores responded to a survey in September that they were very satisfied with the changes—from great sales and promotions delivering more value; improvements to selection and stock; friendly and helpful employees; and a warmer, brighter, and more inviting space.

Based on these learnings, Amazon is excited to unveil similar updates to three Amazon Fresh stores in the LA Area—Pasadena, Irvine, and Woodland Hills. The company’s unparalleled selection in these stores includes over 2,000 new national and private-label brand products, a Krispy Kreme Doughnut shop, and more. Amazon is committed to delivering value, and these Amazon Fresh stores now offer customers everyday sales and low prices on even more core grocery items.

Amazon’s refreshed stores also offer customers additional convenient options to use when shopping or checking out. Customers can use the latest version of the Dash Cart—a smart shopping cart that makes it easier than ever for customers to shop the store, discover new items, find the best deals, and skip the checkout line. Self-checkout was also installed, giving customers even more ways to save time on their grocery trips. This checkout option complements traditional checkout with a store employee so customers can pick what works best for them.

Amazon will continue to open new stores in 2024 as it continues to iterate and experiment, introducing new features and programs to better serve customers.

More ways to save time and money ahead of the holidays

Heading into the holidays, Amazon Fresh will offer great deals for customers in-store and online that allow them to save on the whole spread. Price is an important differentiator for Amazon Fresh customers and as a result, over the last year Amazon has lowered the prices on thousands of items and tripled the size of the promotions it offers, delivering millions of dollars in savings to customers.

Customers can save time during the busy holiday season with free Amazon package return and pickup service at Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market stores. Customers using these services with Amazon Fresh also receive exclusive coupons to use in-store."

It was noted that the fund's top ten holdings, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) class A and B, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ), account for about half of the fund's total assets. While the fund has a heavy concentration in tech stocks (57%), the Nasdaq-100 index it tracks is not purely a technology index but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare. This structure may not cater to investors seeking a tech-focused or broadly diversified investment.

Despite its low expense ratio of 0.2% and an annualized return of 8.95%, the fund's concentration in large stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26% of assets) creates volatility risk and hinders broad diversification.

In terms of performance, as of the end of the first three quarters of 2022, its annualized return was 8.95%, nearly identical to the index's return of 9.17%. This suggests that although Invesco QQQ is efficient and performs its intended function well by closely tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, it may not provide the potential for significant growth beyond what investing directly in the Nasdaq-100 index would yield.

While beneficial for investors seeking to mirror the index's performance, this close alignment can be a double-edged sword. It may not offer substantial returns for those seeking significant growth, raising questions about whether this ETF is a suitable choice for all types of investors.

The messaging platform, originally acquired by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014, has evolved into a comprehensive service since CEO Mark Zuckerberg started leveraging its growth and business opportunities in 2019.

In the present year, ads on WhatsApp and Messenger are projected to generate $10 billion in revenue. This monetization strategy marks a significant shift from the platform's initial resistance to advertising under founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton. Their departure paved the way for Zuckerberg to introduce features like emoji reactions, message forwarding, disappearing messages, and multi-device support.

WhatsApp has also become a valuable tool for businesses. Companies such as Chevrolet, Lenovo, Samsung (KS: ), and L’Oreal utilize its paid tools for various purposes. In 2017, WhatsApp launched ""click-to-message"" advertising which links users from a Facebook ad directly to a brand's WhatsApp account. This feature has been beneficial for companies like Nissan (OTC: ), which built chatbots on WhatsApp for customer interaction in Brazil, generating 30-40% of new sales leads.

The platform is also making strides in the payments sector, developing an infrastructure in India, Brazil, and Singapore that allows for direct purchases. It has secured business partnerships in Latin America and India with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Uber (NYSE: ), further solidifying its position as a key player in the global digital ecosystem.

Despite facing competition from Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iMessage, Signal, Telegram and regulatory challenges in Europe, WhatsApp continues to innovate. It offers features like Channels for following influencers' updates without sharing contact information and Status for temporary updates. The platform prioritizes security with end-to-end encryption aligning with Meta's vision of the metaverse.

The increasing adoption of WhatsApp among young Americans and its leadership under Will Cathcart signal its growing mainstream acceptance. As it continues to evolve, WhatsApp remains a crucial component of Meta's portfolio, demonstrating the potential for further growth and innovation.

CEO Michael Saylor, in an interview with Fox Business, credited the company's Bitcoin holdings for this impressive growth. The company recently celebrated three years of Bitcoin purchasing by adding another 155 Bitcoins worth $5.3 million to its portfolio.

Among these tech giants, only Tesla holds Bitcoin according to its recent quarterly filings. Despite this, MicroStrategy has outperformed all these companies' returns.

The CEO encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy as a means of enhancing shareholder value by countering inflation, high-interest rates, and technology-driven deflation. This strategy involves incorporating Bitcoin into balance sheets to escape the costly cycle of acquisitions, stock buybacks, dividends, and debt.

Saylor expressed optimism about Bitcoin's future growth due to the upcoming 2024 halving and potential demand surge from spot ETFs.

The messaging platform, originally acquired by Facebook for $19 billion in 2014, has evolved into a comprehensive service since CEO Mark Zuckerberg started leveraging its growth and business opportunities in 2019.

In the present year, ads on WhatsApp and Messenger are projected to generate $10 billion in revenue. This monetization strategy marks a significant shift from the platform's initial resistance to advertising under founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton. Their departure paved the way for Zuckerberg to introduce features like emoji reactions, message forwarding, disappearing messages, and multi-device support.

WhatsApp has also become a valuable tool for businesses. Companies such as Chevrolet, Lenovo, Samsung (KS: ), and L’Oreal utilize its paid tools for various purposes. In 2017, WhatsApp launched ""click-to-message"" advertising which links users from a Facebook ad directly to a brand's WhatsApp account. This feature has been beneficial for companies like Nissan (OTC: ), which built chatbots on WhatsApp for customer interaction in Brazil, generating 30-40% of new sales leads.

The platform is also making strides in the payments sector, developing an infrastructure in India, Brazil, and Singapore that allows for direct purchases. It has secured business partnerships in Latin America and India with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Uber (NYSE: ), further solidifying its position as a key player in the global digital ecosystem.

Despite facing competition from Apple (NASDAQ: )'s iMessage, Signal, Telegram and regulatory challenges in Europe, WhatsApp continues to innovate. It offers features like Channels for following influencers' updates without sharing contact information and Status for temporary updates. The platform prioritizes security with end-to-end encryption aligning with Meta's vision of the metaverse.

The increasing adoption of WhatsApp among young Americans and its leadership under Will Cathcart signal its growing mainstream acceptance. As it continues to evolve, WhatsApp remains a crucial component of Meta's portfolio, demonstrating the potential for further growth and innovation.

“If it wasn't for their crackdown on their return-to-office policy, I would still be there with bells on and a smile on my face,” he said.

Instead, he started his new job, “taking a $203,000 pay cut by forfeiting unvested stocks that I'd earned while working at Amazon”.

“Even that huge cut was worth it, rather than being forced to move across the country and abandon my dream life in order to keep my job,” said the employee, who did not wish to be named.

A company spokesperson said that Amazon “could not verify the employee account”.

“We've repeatedly made our position clear: In February, we shared with employees that we'd be asking them to start coming into the office three or more days per week beginning in May because we believe it would yield the best long-term results for our customers, business, and culture,” said the company spokesperson.

“As part of this process, we've asked a relatively small percentage of our team to relocate to be in the same location as their teams.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,"MongoDB , AWS collaborte to optimize Amazon CodeWhisperer",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/mongodb--aws-collaborte-to-optimize-amazon-codewhisperer-432SI-3887258,"MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com (AMZN) company, today announced the two companies are collaborating to optimize Amazon CodeWhisperer to provide enhanced suggestions for application development and modernization on MongoDB's industry-leading developer data platform that millions of developers and tens of thousands of customers rely on every day for business-critical applications. Trained on billions of lines of Amazon and publicly available code, Amazon CodeWhisperer is an AI-powered coding companion from AWS that generates code suggestions based on natural-language comments or existing code in developers' integrated development environments (IDEs). Working together with AWS, MongoDB provided curated training data for MongoDB use cases and took part in the evaluation of Amazon CodeWhisperer outputs throughout the training process to promote high-quality code suggestions. While Amazon CodeWhisperer already provided support for building applications on MongoDB, developers can now get enhanced suggestions that reflect best practices, allowing developers to ideate more quickly, rapidly prototype new features, and accelerate application development.

""Generative AI has the potential to not only revolutionize how end-users interact with modern applications but also how developers build those applications,"" said Andrew Davidson , SVP of Product at MongoDB. ""Collaborating with AWS to train Amazon CodeWhisperer on MongoDB is a step in that direction, and developers can now build more quickly and focus on higher-value tasks. With built-in security scanning and the ability to provide source and licensing information when suggestions resemble publicly available open source training data, Amazon CodeWhisperer now provides developers building on MongoDB a unique experience that will get even better over time.""

""More and more developers are realizing the potential of generative AI-powered coding companions to transform how work gets done, giving them more time to focus on solving hard problems,"" said Deepak Singh , VP of Next Gen Developer Experience at AWS. ""Amazon CodeWhisperer already provides an optimized experience when working on common coding tasks and with AWS APIs. By collaborating with MongoDB, we are extending those capabilities to millions of MongoDB developers. We are excited to put Amazon CodeWhisperer in the hands of even more developers to help them tap into the transformative potential of generative AI.""

As organizations today accelerate deployment of cloud-native applications, developers want to find ways to reduce repetitive tasks so they can focus on building new applications and shipping new features. IDC estimates that 750 million cloud-native applications will be built in the next two years, and that number will likely increase as enterprises and startups alike take advantage of generative AI for both building applications and reinventing end-user application experiences. Developers want to integrate generative AI-powered coding assistants into their day-to-day workflow to help them increase their productivity and focus on harder problems. However, these assistants are often trained on publicly available datasets or a company's own internal data, and some tools developers build with may not have high-quality, publicly available code samples included as part of a coding assistant's training data. As a result, these coding assistants can provide some support for these tools, but the recommendations may not conform to best practices. While developers have realized the potential benefit for AI-powered coding companions across many tasks, they want these solutions to be further optimized for the tools they use today so they can unlock the full potential of generative AI across their day-to-day work.

Through this new collaboration to train and evaluate Amazon CodeWhisperer on code and libraries specific to MongoDB, developers can get enhanced suggestions for MongoDB to help them more quickly build and modernize their applications. AWS and MongoDB worked together to train Amazon CodeWhisperer on highly curated content and code from MongoDB documentation, detailed use cases, and common tasks with best practices that developers encounter when working with data on MongoDB. As a result, Amazon CodeWhisperer can help developers more quickly write high-quality code when building data aggregations, performing database operations, and accelerating migration of applications to MongoDB for modernization. These optimizations are available for five of the most common programming languages used to build with MongoDB, including C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python, while also allowing developers to take advantage of core Amazon CodeWhisperer features, including built-in security scanning and a reference tracker that provides information about the origin of a code suggestion when it resembles open source training data. Amazon CodeWhisperer is free for individual developers with no qualifications or time limits for generating code, so the entire MongoDB community can start taking advantage of Amazon CodeWhisperer's enhanced suggestions. To get started, developers simply install the Amazon CodeWhisperer extension for their preferred IDE, provide an AWS Builder ID, and begin using the service for code completion and generation. Amazon CodeWhisperer now helps reduce the amount of time developers spend creating code for building data-driven applications on MongoDB and will continue to be trained to improve and refine code suggestions."

The changes come after investigations into the companies' use of advertising customers' data raised concerns about the potential misuse of their dominant positions in online retail and social media respectively.

Amazon's investigation was initiated in July 2022 due to concerns over its potential misuse of its dominant UK online retail position. The company was suspected of favoring its own business and sellers using Amazon's warehousing and delivery services over other independent UK sellers on Amazon Marketplace. To address these concerns, Amazon has committed to ensuring that third-party sellers won't have their offers hidden and will have an equal chance of featuring in the 'Buy Box'. The company also pledged not to use third-party seller data for an unfair advantage.

Meta, on the other hand, has committed not to exploit its ad clients' data on Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Marketplace. The company will provide an opt-out for advertisers and limit ad data use in product creation.

The CMA concluded its scrutiny of Amazon Marketplace and Meta's advertising data practices today, receiving pledges from both corporations to uphold fair competition. In July, the CMA noted that Amazon's proposed alterations satisfactorily address competition concerns as per its preliminary view.

Sarah Cardell and Ann Pope from the CMA have welcomed this resolution. They expect more such resolutions with the implementation of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill, which aims to support these sellers, including those using Prime delivery services, to compete fairly against Amazon’s retail arm.

The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade. However, it's clear that other FAANG stocks also hold strong potential for sustained growth.

2022-11-04, Investing.com,"Amazon's drone delivery struggles with limitations, plans expansion with improved model",https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-drone-delivery-struggles-with-limitations-plans-expansion-with-improved-model-93CH-3885562,"Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s drone delivery program, which has been operational in Texas under the leadership of David Carbon, has encountered several challenges in meeting its initial ambitious vision. The program has been hampered by weather restrictions and the constraint of single-item delivery. Despite these hurdles, Amazon is planning to expand the service by 2024 with an improved MK30 drone model.

The company's drone initiative is part of a broader trend of technology innovations that often fail to live up to their initial hype. From 2013 to 2019, companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) with its Wing service and Uber (NYSE: ) Eats with its food delivery drone have attracted approximately $2.5 billion in investment, according to aerospace consultancy Teal Group.

In addition to facing regulatory challenges from the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.), Amazon's program has had to contend with consumer perceptions of drones as novelty toys. To encourage usage of its drone delivery service, Amazon has offered incentives such as gift certificates and promotional items. Recently, it added medication delivery to its list of services.

However, some residents view the drone program more as a marketing tool for Amazon than a practical delivery solution. Archie Conner, a resident of College Station, is one such individual who sees drones in this light.

Despite these challenges and perceptions, Amazon remains optimistic about the future of its drone delivery program. This optimism is underscored by its ambitious patent for a high-altitude drone resupply vehicle. The company continues to invest in and develop this innovative approach to package delivery, aiming to overcome the current limitations and deliver on its initial vision.

The company claims that Amazon's Prime and Twitch services and HP devices are using technology covered by Nokia's patents without agreeing to fair licensing terms.

The lawsuits were announced on Friday by Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, Arvin Patel. The company is accusing Amazon and HP of not playing by the rules and benefiting from technologies that Nokia invested heavily in developing. The legal actions involve filing cases against Amazon in five jurisdictions: the UK, US, India, Germany, and the EU Unified Patent Court. A separate case is being lodged against HP in the US.

These patents are the result of a €140 billion investment by Nokia since 2000 and cover areas such as video compression, content delivery, content recommendation, and hardware-related aspects. In a blog post, Nokia highlighted its substantial R&D investment over two decades, which includes ownership of more than 20,000 patent families and a €4.5 billion expenditure last year alone.

Despite the ongoing litigation with Amazon and HP, Nokia has successfully concluded licensing agreements with other tech giants like Samsung (KS: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). The company emphasized its technology's influence in powering industries across multiple countries.

In addition to these cases, Amazon is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission.

The billionaire entrepreneur said he seeks to stay closer to his parents, his partner, and Blue Origin - the space company he founded and is currently actively managing.

Amazon, which Bezos started out of the garage of his rented Seattle house in 1994, remains the city's top employer and is often credited with helping shape the seaport city into into one of the biggest global tech hubs.

Prior to his 2021 resignation, Bezos spent nearly 3 decades as the CEO of the e-commerce giant. He remains the executive chairman of the company's board."
2022-11-03, Investing.com,Meta and Amazon commit to fair competition practices following CMA investigation,https://in.investing.com/news/meta-and-amazon-commit-to-fair-competition-practices-following-cma-investigation-93CH-3884684,"Following an investigation into potential market dominance abuse, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has secured commitments from tech giants Meta and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to ensure fair competition on their platforms. This comes as a result of concerns that the companies were exploiting customer data for unfair competitive advantages.

Today, the CMA announced that Meta, the leading digital display advertising supplier in the UK, has pledged to prevent potential misuse of advertising customer data. This commitment stems from a June 2021 investigation into allegations that Meta was unjustly utilizing specific ad data against online classified ad services. As part of its commitment, Meta will allow competitors of Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Marketplace to opt out of their ad data being used by Meta for product enhancement. Furthermore, Meta has also committed to limit the use of ad data in product development to avoid exploiting customer data against advertisers.

The CMA had expressed concern that Meta was using ad data from businesses to enhance its products in competition with those businesses. In 2021, Meta earned between £4-5 billion from UK advertising with over 10 million advertisers, largely small and medium-sized businesses. To ensure compliance with these commitments, a monitoring trustee will supervise Meta's adherence.

In addition to Meta, Amazon has also made commitments following an investigation into potential market dominance abuse in 2022. Amazon's commitments aim to provide a level playing field for third-party sellers and optimal deals for UK customers, primarily through the ‘Buy Box’. The company is now prohibited from exploiting third-party seller data and must enable sellers to negotiate delivery rates with independent Prime providers. Compliance with these commitments will be monitored by an independent trustee.

These resolutions have been welcomed by CMA officials Sarah Cardell and Ann Pope who anticipate that they will shape future regulatory decisions once the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill is enacted. Both Amazon and Meta have expressed approval of these resolutions which are designed to level the playing field for over 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses against Amazon's retail arm.

InvestingPro Insights

Based on real-time data from InvestingPro, Amazon's net income is expected to grow this year, with 21 analysts revising their earnings upwards for the upcoming period. This could be a result of the company's recent commitments to fair competition, which may lead to enhanced performance and profitability. However, it should be noted that Amazon is trading at a high earnings multiple, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The company's market capitalization is currently at 1430.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 70.39. Over the past week, Amazon's price total return was 8.09%, showing a significant return.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Meta, on the other hand, has been aggressively buying back shares and its revenue growth has been accelerating, which could be a positive sign for investors. The company has also been yielding a high return on invested capital, suggesting efficient use of its resources. However, Meta is quickly burning through cash, which could be a concern for some investors. The company's market capitalization is currently at 1260M USD, with a P/E ratio of 7.94.

2022-11-03, IANS,Amazon to close 2 clothing stores just 17 months after opening 1st outlet,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-to-close-2-clothing-stores-just-17-months-after-opening-1st-outlet-3883876,"San Francisco, Nov 3 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has confirmed to close its two ""Amazon Style clothing stores"" in the US just 17 months after opening the first outlet, marking the latest shift in its physical retail strategy.The company said it will close the two stores in Columbus, Ohio, and Glendale, California, by November 9, reports CNBC.

“After careful consideration, we’ve decided to close our two Amazon Style physical retail stores and focus on our online fashion shopping experience, where we’re offering new, exciting selection(s) at great value and introducing innovative technology to meet the needs of every customer,” Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish was quoted as saying.

“Physical retail remains an important part of our business, and we’re continuing to invest in growing our grocery stores business, which spans Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go, and third-party partnerships,” she added.

In January 2022, Amazon introduced a new concept and later opened a store in Glendale to the public in May 2022. This marked Amazon's first step into selling clothes, shoes, and accessories in physical retail stores, and their latest attempt to break into physical retail.

Kish also mentioned that Amazon will continue to open new stores and revamp its Fresh grocery chain, with two redesigned stores recently opening in Chicago.

In March last year, Amazon shut down most of its brick-and-mortar storefronts, including Amazon Books, across the US and the UK.

The company shut over 60 bookstores, Amazon Pop Ups and ""Amazon 4-star"" shops.

In an emotional post on Instagram, the billionaire showed an old video from 1994, featuring him giving a walkthrough of Amazon's first office inside the garage.

""I've lived in Seattle longer than I've lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here. As exciting as the move is, it's an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart,"" Bezos posted.

The old video, which features a young Bezos, was shot by his father.

""That's my dad behind the camera in this video, touring Amazon's first 'office'. My parents have always been my biggest supporters,"" said the Amazon founder.

His parents recently moved back to Miami, the place Bezos lived when he was younger.

""I want to be close to my parents, and Lauren (Sanchez) and I love Miami. Also, Blue Origin's operations are increasingly shifting to Cape Canaveral. For all that, I'm planning to return to Miami, leaving the Pacific Northwest,"" he announced.

Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.

He founded Amazon in mid-1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle.

The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, Bezos and his girlfriend Sanchez are reportedly not planning the wedding yet and are still ""enjoying the engagement"".

In May this year, Bezos, 59, and Sanchez, 53, got engaged. They started dating in 2018 and reportedly went public with their relationship after the Amazon billionaire divorced his first wife MacKenzie Scott in 2019.

Bezos made a $38 billion divorce settlement with Scott and shares four children with her.

“Amazon has also quietly and deliberately raised prices for shoppers through a covert operation called 'Project Nessie',” read the FTC complaint.

“Explicitly intended to inflate the prices that shoppers pay, Amazon’s Project Nessie has already extracted over a billion dollars from American households,” it added.

When activated, this algorithm raises prices for those products and, when other stores follow suit, keeps the now-higher price in place. Amazon deemed Project Nessie “an incredible success”.

“Aware of the public fallout it risks, Amazon has turned Project Nessie off during periods of heightened outside scrutiny and then back on when it thinks that no one is watching,” the FTC complaint alleged.

While Project Nessie is currently paused, “Amazon could turn it back on at any time. Indeed, Amazon has repeatedly considered turning it back on -- and there are no obstacles preventing Amazon from doing so,” read the FTC complaint.

An Amazon spokesperson told The Verge in a statement that the ""FTC claims that an old Amazon pricing algorithm called Nessie is an unfair method of competition that led to raised prices for consumers"".

“This grossly mischaracterises this tool. Nessie was used to trying to stop our price matching from resulting in unusual outcomes where prices became so low that they were unsustainable,” the company spokesperson added.

The FTC and its state partners had said in the lawsuit that Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

""Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,"" said FTC Chair Khan.

“If it wasn't for their crackdown on their return-to-office policy, I would still be there with bells on and a smile on my face,” he said.

Instead, he started his new job, “taking a $203,000 pay cut by forfeiting unvested stocks that I'd earned while working at Amazon”.

“Even that huge cut was worth it, rather than being forced to move across the country and abandon my dream life in order to keep my job,” said the employee, who did not wish to be named.

A company spokesperson said that Amazon “could not verify the employee account”.

“We've repeatedly made our position clear: In February, we shared with employees that we'd be asking them to start coming into the office three or more days per week beginning in May because we believe it would yield the best long-term results for our customers, business, and culture,” said the company spokesperson.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,"MongoDB , AWS collaborte to optimize Amazon CodeWhisperer",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/mongodb--aws-collaborte-to-optimize-amazon-codewhisperer-432SI-3887258,"MongoDB, Inc. (MDB) and Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com (AMZN) company, today announced the two companies are collaborating to optimize Amazon CodeWhisperer to provide enhanced suggestions for application development and modernization on MongoDB's industry-leading developer data platform that millions of developers and tens of thousands of customers rely on every day for business-critical applications. Trained on billions of lines of Amazon and publicly available code, Amazon CodeWhisperer is an AI-powered coding companion from AWS that generates code suggestions based on natural-language comments or existing code in developers' integrated development environments (IDEs). Working together with AWS, MongoDB provided curated training data for MongoDB use cases and took part in the evaluation of Amazon CodeWhisperer outputs throughout the training process to promote high-quality code suggestions. While Amazon CodeWhisperer already provided support for building applications on MongoDB, developers can now get enhanced suggestions that reflect best practices, allowing developers to ideate more quickly, rapidly prototype new features, and accelerate application development.

""Generative AI has the potential to not only revolutionize how end-users interact with modern applications but also how developers build those applications,"" said Andrew Davidson , SVP of Product at MongoDB. ""Collaborating with AWS to train Amazon CodeWhisperer on MongoDB is a step in that direction, and developers can now build more quickly and focus on higher-value tasks. With built-in security scanning and the ability to provide source and licensing information when suggestions resemble publicly available open source training data, Amazon CodeWhisperer now provides developers building on MongoDB a unique experience that will get even better over time.""

""More and more developers are realizing the potential of generative AI-powered coding companions to transform how work gets done, giving them more time to focus on solving hard problems,"" said Deepak Singh , VP of Next Gen Developer Experience at AWS. ""Amazon CodeWhisperer already provides an optimized experience when working on common coding tasks and with AWS APIs. By collaborating with MongoDB, we are extending those capabilities to millions of MongoDB developers. We are excited to put Amazon CodeWhisperer in the hands of even more developers to help them tap into the transformative potential of generative AI.""

As organizations today accelerate deployment of cloud-native applications, developers want to find ways to reduce repetitive tasks so they can focus on building new applications and shipping new features. IDC estimates that 750 million cloud-native applications will be built in the next two years, and that number will likely increase as enterprises and startups alike take advantage of generative AI for both building applications and reinventing end-user application experiences. Developers want to integrate generative AI-powered coding assistants into their day-to-day workflow to help them increase their productivity and focus on harder problems. However, these assistants are often trained on publicly available datasets or a company's own internal data, and some tools developers build with may not have high-quality, publicly available code samples included as part of a coding assistant's training data. As a result, these coding assistants can provide some support for these tools, but the recommendations may not conform to best practices. While developers have realized the potential benefit for AI-powered coding companions across many tasks, they want these solutions to be further optimized for the tools they use today so they can unlock the full potential of generative AI across their day-to-day work.

Through this new collaboration to train and evaluate Amazon CodeWhisperer on code and libraries specific to MongoDB, developers can get enhanced suggestions for MongoDB to help them more quickly build and modernize their applications. AWS and MongoDB worked together to train Amazon CodeWhisperer on highly curated content and code from MongoDB documentation, detailed use cases, and common tasks with best practices that developers encounter when working with data on MongoDB. As a result, Amazon CodeWhisperer can help developers more quickly write high-quality code when building data aggregations, performing database operations, and accelerating migration of applications to MongoDB for modernization. These optimizations are available for five of the most common programming languages used to build with MongoDB, including C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, and Python, while also allowing developers to take advantage of core Amazon CodeWhisperer features, including built-in security scanning and a reference tracker that provides information about the origin of a code suggestion when it resembles open source training data. Amazon CodeWhisperer is free for individual developers with no qualifications or time limits for generating code, so the entire MongoDB community can start taking advantage of Amazon CodeWhisperer's enhanced suggestions.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Amazon and Meta commit to fair competition practices in the UK,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-and-meta-commit-to-fair-competition-practices-in-the-uk-93CH-3887232,"In a move to uphold fair competition, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta have pledged to alter their advertising data practices following scrutiny from the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The changes come after investigations into the companies' use of advertising customers' data raised concerns about the potential misuse of their dominant positions in online retail and social media respectively.

Amazon's investigation was initiated in July 2022 due to concerns over its potential misuse of its dominant UK online retail position. The company was suspected of favoring its own business and sellers using Amazon's warehousing and delivery services over other independent UK sellers on Amazon Marketplace. To address these concerns, Amazon has committed to ensuring that third-party sellers won't have their offers hidden and will have an equal chance of featuring in the 'Buy Box'. The company also pledged not to use third-party seller data for an unfair advantage.

Meta, on the other hand, has committed not to exploit its ad clients' data on Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Marketplace. The company will provide an opt-out for advertisers and limit ad data use in product creation.

The CMA concluded its scrutiny of Amazon Marketplace and Meta's advertising data practices today, receiving pledges from both corporations to uphold fair competition. In July, the CMA noted that Amazon's proposed alterations satisfactorily address competition concerns as per its preliminary view.

Sarah Cardell and Ann Pope from the CMA have welcomed this resolution. They expect more such resolutions with the implementation of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill, which aims to support these sellers, including those using Prime delivery services, to compete fairly against Amazon’s retail arm.

Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade. However, it's clear that other FAANG stocks also hold strong potential for sustained growth.

The program has been hampered by weather restrictions and the constraint of single-item delivery. Despite these hurdles, Amazon is planning to expand the service by 2024 with an improved MK30 drone model.

The company's drone initiative is part of a broader trend of technology innovations that often fail to live up to their initial hype. From 2013 to 2019, companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) with its Wing service and Uber (NYSE: ) Eats with its food delivery drone have attracted approximately $2.5 billion in investment, according to aerospace consultancy Teal Group.

In addition to facing regulatory challenges from the Federal Aviation Administration (F.A.A.), Amazon's program has had to contend with consumer perceptions of drones as novelty toys. To encourage usage of its drone delivery service, Amazon has offered incentives such as gift certificates and promotional items. Recently, it added medication delivery to its list of services.

However, some residents view the drone program more as a marketing tool for Amazon than a practical delivery solution. Archie Conner, a resident of College Station, is one such individual who sees drones in this light.

Despite these challenges and perceptions, Amazon remains optimistic about the future of its drone delivery program. This optimism is underscored by its ambitious patent for a high-altitude drone resupply vehicle. The company continues to invest in and develop this innovative approach to package delivery, aiming to overcome the current limitations and deliver on its initial vision.

Despite this positive momentum, Alphabet's stock price remained $12.12 below its annual high of $141.22, which was attained on October 12th.

The company claims that Amazon's Prime and Twitch services and HP devices are using technology covered by Nokia's patents without agreeing to fair licensing terms.

The lawsuits were announced on Friday by Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, Arvin Patel. The company is accusing Amazon and HP of not playing by the rules and benefiting from technologies that Nokia invested heavily in developing. The legal actions involve filing cases against Amazon in five jurisdictions: the UK, US, India, Germany, and the EU Unified Patent Court. A separate case is being lodged against HP in the US.

These patents are the result of a €140 billion investment by Nokia since 2000 and cover areas such as video compression, content delivery, content recommendation, and hardware-related aspects. In a blog post, Nokia highlighted its substantial R&D investment over two decades, which includes ownership of more than 20,000 patent families and a €4.5 billion expenditure last year alone.

Despite the ongoing litigation with Amazon and HP, Nokia has successfully concluded licensing agreements with other tech giants like Samsung (KS: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). The company emphasized its technology's influence in powering industries across multiple countries.

In addition to these cases, Amazon is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the US Federal Trade Commission.

The billionaire entrepreneur said he seeks to stay closer to his parents, his partner, and Blue Origin - the space company he founded and is currently actively managing.

Amazon, which Bezos started out of the garage of his rented Seattle house in 1994, remains the city's top employer and is often credited with helping shape the seaport city into into one of the biggest global tech hubs.

Prior to his 2021 resignation, Bezos spent nearly 3 decades as the CEO of the e-commerce giant. He remains the executive chairman of the company's board."
2022-11-03, Investing.com,Meta and Amazon commit to fair competition practices following CMA investigation,https://in.investing.com/news/meta-and-amazon-commit-to-fair-competition-practices-following-cma-investigation-93CH-3884684,"Following an investigation into potential market dominance abuse, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has secured commitments from tech giants Meta and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to ensure fair competition on their platforms. This comes as a result of concerns that the companies were exploiting customer data for unfair competitive advantages.

Today, the CMA announced that Meta, the leading digital display advertising supplier in the UK, has pledged to prevent potential misuse of advertising customer data. This commitment stems from a June 2021 investigation into allegations that Meta was unjustly utilizing specific ad data against online classified ad services. As part of its commitment, Meta will allow competitors of Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Marketplace to opt out of their ad data being used by Meta for product enhancement. Furthermore, Meta has also committed to limit the use of ad data in product development to avoid exploiting customer data against advertisers.

The CMA had expressed concern that Meta was using ad data from businesses to enhance its products in competition with those businesses. In 2021, Meta earned between £4-5 billion from UK advertising with over 10 million advertisers, largely small and medium-sized businesses. To ensure compliance with these commitments, a monitoring trustee will supervise Meta's adherence.

In addition to Meta, Amazon has also made commitments following an investigation into potential market dominance abuse in 2022. Amazon's commitments aim to provide a level playing field for third-party sellers and optimal deals for UK customers, primarily through the ‘Buy Box’. The company is now prohibited from exploiting third-party seller data and must enable sellers to negotiate delivery rates with independent Prime providers. Compliance with these commitments will be monitored by an independent trustee.

These resolutions have been welcomed by CMA officials Sarah Cardell and Ann Pope who anticipate that they will shape future regulatory decisions once the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill is enacted. Both Amazon and Meta have expressed approval of these resolutions which are designed to level the playing field for over 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses against Amazon's retail arm.

InvestingPro Insights

Based on real-time data from InvestingPro, Amazon's net income is expected to grow this year, with 21 analysts revising their earnings upwards for the upcoming period. This could be a result of the company's recent commitments to fair competition, which may lead to enhanced performance and profitability. However, it should be noted that Amazon is trading at a high earnings multiple, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. The company's market capitalization is currently at 1430.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 70.39. Over the past week, Amazon's price total return was 8.09%, showing a significant return.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Meta, on the other hand, has been aggressively buying back shares and its revenue growth has been accelerating, which could be a positive sign for investors. The company has also been yielding a high return on invested capital, suggesting efficient use of its resources. However, Meta is quickly burning through cash, which could be a concern for some investors. The company's market capitalization is currently at 1260M USD, with a P/E ratio of 7.94.

“After careful consideration, we’ve decided to close our two Amazon Style physical retail stores and focus on our online fashion shopping experience, where we’re offering new, exciting selection(s) at great value and introducing innovative technology to meet the needs of every customer,” Amazon spokesperson Kristen Kish was quoted as saying.

“Physical retail remains an important part of our business, and we’re continuing to invest in growing our grocery stores business, which spans Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go, and third-party partnerships,” she added.

In January 2022, Amazon introduced a new concept and later opened a store in Glendale to the public in May 2022. This marked Amazon's first step into selling clothes, shoes, and accessories in physical retail stores, and their latest attempt to break into physical retail.

Kish also mentioned that Amazon will continue to open new stores and revamp its Fresh grocery chain, with two redesigned stores recently opening in Chicago.

In March last year, Amazon shut down most of its brick-and-mortar storefronts, including Amazon Books, across the US and the UK.

The company shut over 60 bookstores, Amazon Pop Ups and ""Amazon 4-star"" shops.

In an emotional post on Instagram, the billionaire showed an old video from 1994, featuring him giving a walkthrough of Amazon's first office inside the garage.

""I've lived in Seattle longer than I've lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here. As exciting as the move is, it's an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart,"" Bezos posted.

The old video, which features a young Bezos, was shot by his father.

""That's my dad behind the camera in this video, touring Amazon's first 'office'. My parents have always been my biggest supporters,"" said the Amazon founder.

His parents recently moved back to Miami, the place Bezos lived when he was younger.

""I want to be close to my parents, and Lauren (Sanchez) and I love Miami. Also, Blue Origin's operations are increasingly shifting to Cape Canaveral. For all that, I'm planning to return to Miami, leaving the Pacific Northwest,"" he announced.

Born in Albuquerque and raised in Houston and Miami, Bezos graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.

He founded Amazon in mid-1994 on a road trip from New York City to Seattle.

The company began as an online bookstore and has since expanded to a variety of other e-commerce products and services, including video and audio streaming, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

Meanwhile, Bezos and his girlfriend Sanchez are reportedly not planning the wedding yet and are still ""enjoying the engagement"".

In May this year, Bezos, 59, and Sanchez, 53, got engaged. They started dating in 2018 and reportedly went public with their relationship after the Amazon billionaire divorced his first wife MacKenzie Scott in 2019.

Bezos made a $38 billion divorce settlement with Scott and shares four children with her.

“Amazon has also quietly and deliberately raised prices for shoppers through a covert operation called 'Project Nessie',” read the FTC complaint.

“Explicitly intended to inflate the prices that shoppers pay, Amazon’s Project Nessie has already extracted over a billion dollars from American households,” it added.

When activated, this algorithm raises prices for those products and, when other stores follow suit, keeps the now-higher price in place. Amazon deemed Project Nessie “an incredible success”.

“Aware of the public fallout it risks, Amazon has turned Project Nessie off during periods of heightened outside scrutiny and then back on when it thinks that no one is watching,” the FTC complaint alleged.

While Project Nessie is currently paused, “Amazon could turn it back on at any time. Indeed, Amazon has repeatedly considered turning it back on -- and there are no obstacles preventing Amazon from doing so,” read the FTC complaint.

An Amazon spokesperson told The Verge in a statement that the ""FTC claims that an old Amazon pricing algorithm called Nessie is an unfair method of competition that led to raised prices for consumers"".

“This grossly mischaracterises this tool. Nessie was used to trying to stop our price matching from resulting in unusual outcomes where prices became so low that they were unsustainable,” the company spokesperson added.

The FTC and its state partners had said in the lawsuit that Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

""Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,"" said FTC Chair Khan.

Affirm shares jumped on the news, currently up more than 17%, trading around the $20.70 per share mark.

Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) store, which helps businesses digitize and automate procurement, will now allow customers to split the total cost of eligible purchases and pay over time using Affirm without late or hidden fees.

Amazon Business said it will begin rolling out Affirm on Thursday to eligible sole proprietor businesses, with the new payment option available at checkout to all eligible Amazon Business sole proprietor customers by Black Friday.

“We’re constantly striving to make Amazon Business the best place for small businesses to fulfill their buying needs. Integrating Affirm as a payment option helps us do just that, while providing more flexibility and convenience to our customers,” said Todd Heimes, director of Amazon Business Worldwide.

The deal is Affirm’s first new B2B pay-over-time solution for sole proprietors.

“According to the IRS1, more than 28 million sole proprietorships do business in the United States. By offering these business owners a transparent and flexible way to pay over time for the items they need, we can help them increase their purchasing power, better manage their cash flow, and accelerate their growth,” said Wayne Pommen, Affirm’s Chief Revenue Officer."

The firm told investors that Amazon’s structural opportunity in cloud surpasses even the lock-in effect with consumers in e-commerce.

“AWS remains one of the most attractive stories in tech; short-term growth hiccups don’t impair the secular growth story,” the investment bank wrote.

“We believe Amazon is at an inflection point. While fixing the overinvestment issue will require more time, we expect greater focus on costs and slowing capex to drive a material increase in FCF. In sum, our estimates for cumulative capex for 2024-25 are USD8.7bn below consensus, which puts us 13-14% above consensus FCF(CFO-capex),” the firm added.

The analysts also described AWS as Amazon’s crown jewel, stating that it enables everything that Amazon does.

“Although much of Amazon’s recent de-rating appears to have been driven by slowing growth at AWS, we have high conviction that this is short-term and macro-driven, and that investors should have confidence in the long-term growth opportunity that the secular shift into the cloud will bring. We think customers optimising spend is a key argument pro-cloud, not a sign of weakness,” said HSBC.

“We believe that the short-term cyclical headwinds at AWS create an attractive entry point in one of the best secular growth stories in tech,” the firm concluded."

The legal action alleges unauthorized use of Nokia's patented technologies by these companies.

Nokia's lawsuits claim that technologies powering services like Amazon Prime TV and HP's computers infringe on its multimedia patents. These patents include areas such as video compression, content delivery, content recommendation, and hardware. The company believes that Amazon and HP have significantly benefited from these inventions in the streaming market, which is anticipated to be worth $300 billion by 2027.

Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, stated that this legal action follows years of unsuccessful discussions with both Amazon and HP. Patel cited these companies' non-compliance with common industry rules as the reason for resorting to litigation. Despite the ongoing lawsuits, Patel emphasized Nokia's commitment to maintaining an open door for constructive dialogue with firms using their patented technology.

These legal actions come amidst concerns over a perceived market imbalance in the streaming industry. However, Nokia has successfully secured agreements with other tech industry leaders like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) regarding its patented technologies.

While Nokia is seeking compensation and royalties for this alleged infringement, both Amazon and HP have yet to respond to these allegations.

Digital payments made via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) also increased by 40 per cent in October from a year earlier.

Economists see easing inflation and rising wages, especially in rural areas.

Consumer confidence hit a four-year high in September, according to the latest figures by the central bank, and demand for bank loans is near a 12-year high despite interest rate hikes this year.

According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India's GDP will grow at the fastest rate among major economies in 2022 and 2024, at 6.3 per cent in both years.

Aside from the festive season, the Cricket World Cup and the forthcoming wedding season are likely to boost consumption.

Online sales from Amazon, Flipkart and others reached 47 billion rupees ($565 million) in the week through October 15, said the report by the market research firm Redseer Strategy Consultants.

High average selling price (ASP) items such as mobiles, electronics and large appliances emerged as the largest contributor to the sales, driving 67 per cent of the total sales, it mentioned.

Flipkart Group continued to assert its leadership in week 1 of the festive season sale, further gaining market share over last year’s sales to reach 63 per cent in terms of Gross merchandise value (GMV).

These patented technologies include video compression, content delivery, content recommendation, and hardware-related components. Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, stated that despite years of extensive discussions with both Amazon and HP, their failure to comply with established rules has led to the current legal confrontations.

Patel emphasized that companies capitalizing on Nokia's research in areas like content delivery for their streaming services owe adequate compensation. While Nokia usually seeks peaceful resolutions in patent disputes, it has demonstrated a readiness to resort to litigation if necessary.

The company also highlighted the anticipated growth in the streaming market, projected to reach $300 billion by 2027. It expressed dissatisfaction over the imbalance between technology innovators and primary beneficiaries.

Arvin Patel, Chief Licensing Officer, New Segments at Nokia, said in a blog post that they have commenced legal action against Amazon for the unauthorised use of Nokia’s video-related technologies in its streaming services and devices.

The cases against Amazon have been filed in the US, Germany, India, the UK and the European Unified Patent Court.

“Amazon Prime Video and Amazon’s streaming devices infringe a mix of Nokia’s multimedia patents covering multiple technologies including video compression, content delivery, content recommendation and aspects related to hardware,” Patel said late on Tuesday.

Separately, Nokia filed cases in the US against HP for “the unauthorised use of Nokia’s patented video-related technologies in their devices”.

Since 2017, Nokia has concluded or extended over 250 licenses – including amicable licenses with Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) - and launched just 6 litigation campaigns.

“We’ve been in discussions with each of Amazon and HP for a number of years, but sometimes litigation is the only way to respond to companies who choose not to play by the rules followed and respected by others. And let’s be clear: Amazon and HP benefit significantly from Nokia’s multimedia inventions,” said Patel.

Since 2000, Nokia has invested more than 140 billion euros (and over 4.5 billion euros last year alone) in R&D for cutting edge technologies including cellular and multimedia.

“As a result, we hold one of the world’s strongest patent portfolios of connectivity and multimedia technologies - and it is no exaggeration to say that entire industries are powered by these inventions,” Patel informed.

Nokia is now seeking compensation for the use of its technologies, royalties which “we will reinvest, along with substantial amounts of additional investment, in the development of next generation multimedia technology”.

“Litigation is never our first choice. Our preference is to reach amicable agreements with the companies who rely upon our technology, and our door remains open for constructive, good-faith negotiations,” the company said.

The resilience of US consumers was indicated by McDonald's (NYSE: ) outperforming Q3 earnings estimates despite high borrowing costs. Additionally, the de-escalating Israel-Gaza conflict led to a dip in oil prices, encouraging investors to re-enter markets.

After a tough period characterized by mixed Big Tech results and market corrections, the stock market now looks to the Federal Reserve and Apple for a potential positive turnaround.

The rally, marked by a 1.5% increase, was influenced by factors such as month-end flows and dip buying, which were prompted by softer Eurozone inflation.

The reluctance of the US to support a broader conflict potentially involving Iran, and concerning comments from Turkey, continue to add to market uncertainties. Despite this, a sense of market relief has been noticeable.

Among the significant contributors to Nasdaq's rally were Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), collectively known as part of the ""Magnificent 7"". Meta's move towards ad-free subscriptions led to a 3.4% increase in its shares. Amazon also saw a sustained rally of 3.4%, while Microsoft observed a 2.7% rise.

However, the sustainability of this rally remains uncertain. It may require backing from entities such as the Federal Reserve or the bond market to maintain its momentum.

In the context of Israel's ground offensive not opening a second front, the market has shown resilience. This resilience is particularly evident in Nasdaq's performance, which is staging a recovery despite these ongoing challenges.

Earnings season in full swing

Around half of the S&P 500 companies reported so far, with 78% having reported a positive EPS surprise. Moreover, 28 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance, while 14 companies have issued positive EPS guidance.

The blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 2.7% in Q3 2022. If this rate holds, it will be the first quarter of YoY earnings growth reported by the index since Q3 2022, according to FactSet.

“In aggregate, the Q3 earnings season has been one of the worst in a while, not so much in terms of reported EPS vs. expectations but instead due to the totality of the reports,” analysts at Vital Knowledge added.

On September 30, the estimated YoY earnings decline for the S&P 500 for Q3 2022 was -0.3%. Nine sectors are reporting higher earnings today compared to September 30 due to positive EPS surprises and upward revisions to EPS estimates.

What analysts are saying

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our view can be boiled down to “things are so bad, they’re good”. We’re taking the commentary from CEOs/CFOs over the government’s GDP report as a measure of the economy and as a result, yields have much more downside than upside risks (the data will eventually catch up to what companies are seeing on the ground). Meanwhile, sentiment has rarely been this bleak, prices are oversold, and selling pressure is exhausted – this makes for a favorable technical setup.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “We think the S&P 500 price action into year-end is more likely to come down to where the average stock is trading rather than rallying to higher levels

because breadth typically leads price. Based on our fundamental and technical analysis, we remain comfortable with our long-standing 3,900 year-end target for the S&P 500, which implies a 17x multiple on our 2024 EPS forecast of approximately $230.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “Although we expect headwinds to discount rates and balance sheets to persist, we would view a substantial further downgrade to the growth outlook as a buying opportunity.”

BTIG’s analysts: “We have been skeptical of the seasonal rally and even if November is positive, it likely won’t be a smooth/easy rally and could very well start from a lower level… Breaking below [4130] opens the door towards 3,950-4,000. Either way it’s likely to be a November to Remember.”

Oppenheimer’s analysts: “The breach of the S&P 500’s 200-day average indicates that the correction since July hasn’t run its course. We see 4,050 as next support and, to mark improvement, we’re watching for a key reversal day, or a rally back above 4,240. Most interesting about the correction is that risk has been dragged lower by safety. This is why we believe long-term opportunity is being presented.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Absent pre-emptive rate cuts by global central banks, we see risks compounding with peak effect of restrictive monetary policy still ahead… Real rates suggest equity market is overvalued.”"

Affirm shares jumped on the news, currently up more than 17%, trading around the $20.70 per share mark.

Amazon's business-to-business (B2B) store, which helps businesses digitize and automate procurement, will now allow customers to split the total cost of eligible purchases and pay over time using Affirm without late or hidden fees.

Amazon Business said it will begin rolling out Affirm on Thursday to eligible sole proprietor businesses, with the new payment option available at checkout to all eligible Amazon Business sole proprietor customers by Black Friday.

“We’re constantly striving to make Amazon Business the best place for small businesses to fulfill their buying needs. Integrating Affirm as a payment option helps us do just that, while providing more flexibility and convenience to our customers,” said Todd Heimes, director of Amazon Business Worldwide.

The deal is Affirm’s first new B2B pay-over-time solution for sole proprietors.

“According to the IRS1, more than 28 million sole proprietorships do business in the United States. By offering these business owners a transparent and flexible way to pay over time for the items they need, we can help them increase their purchasing power, better manage their cash flow, and accelerate their growth,” said Wayne Pommen, Affirm’s Chief Revenue Officer."

The firm told investors that Amazon’s structural opportunity in cloud surpasses even the lock-in effect with consumers in e-commerce.

“AWS remains one of the most attractive stories in tech; short-term growth hiccups don’t impair the secular growth story,” the investment bank wrote.

“We believe Amazon is at an inflection point. While fixing the overinvestment issue will require more time, we expect greater focus on costs and slowing capex to drive a material increase in FCF. In sum, our estimates for cumulative capex for 2024-25 are USD8.7bn below consensus, which puts us 13-14% above consensus FCF(CFO-capex),” the firm added.

The analysts also described AWS as Amazon’s crown jewel, stating that it enables everything that Amazon does.

“Although much of Amazon’s recent de-rating appears to have been driven by slowing growth at AWS, we have high conviction that this is short-term and macro-driven, and that investors should have confidence in the long-term growth opportunity that the secular shift into the cloud will bring. We think customers optimising spend is a key argument pro-cloud, not a sign of weakness,” said HSBC.

“We believe that the short-term cyclical headwinds at AWS create an attractive entry point in one of the best secular growth stories in tech,” the firm concluded."

The legal action alleges unauthorized use of Nokia's patented technologies by these companies.

Nokia's lawsuits claim that technologies powering services like Amazon Prime TV and HP's computers infringe on its multimedia patents. These patents include areas such as video compression, content delivery, content recommendation, and hardware. The company believes that Amazon and HP have significantly benefited from these inventions in the streaming market, which is anticipated to be worth $300 billion by 2027.

Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, stated that this legal action follows years of unsuccessful discussions with both Amazon and HP. Patel cited these companies' non-compliance with common industry rules as the reason for resorting to litigation. Despite the ongoing lawsuits, Patel emphasized Nokia's commitment to maintaining an open door for constructive dialogue with firms using their patented technology.

These legal actions come amidst concerns over a perceived market imbalance in the streaming industry. However, Nokia has successfully secured agreements with other tech industry leaders like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) regarding its patented technologies.

While Nokia is seeking compensation and royalties for this alleged infringement, both Amazon and HP have yet to respond to these allegations.

“Amazon Prime Video and Amazon’s streaming devices infringe a mix of Nokia’s multimedia patents covering multiple technologies including video compression, content delivery, content recommendation and aspects related to hardware,” Patel said late on Tuesday.

Separately, Nokia filed cases in the US against HP for “the unauthorised use of Nokia’s patented video-related technologies in their devices”.

Since 2017, Nokia has concluded or extended over 250 licenses – including amicable licenses with Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) - and launched just 6 litigation campaigns.

“We’ve been in discussions with each of Amazon and HP for a number of years, but sometimes litigation is the only way to respond to companies who choose not to play by the rules followed and respected by others. And let’s be clear: Amazon and HP benefit significantly from Nokia’s multimedia inventions,” said Patel.

Since 2000, Nokia has invested more than 140 billion euros (and over 4.5 billion euros last year alone) in R&D for cutting edge technologies including cellular and multimedia.

“As a result, we hold one of the world’s strongest patent portfolios of connectivity and multimedia technologies - and it is no exaggeration to say that entire industries are powered by these inventions,” Patel informed.

Nokia is now seeking compensation for the use of its technologies, royalties which “we will reinvest, along with substantial amounts of additional investment, in the development of next generation multimedia technology”.

“Litigation is never our first choice. Our preference is to reach amicable agreements with the companies who rely upon our technology, and our door remains open for constructive, good-faith negotiations,” the company said.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,Nokia Initiates Lawsuits Against Amazon and HP Over Video Technology Patents,https://in.investing.com/news/nokia-initiates-lawsuits-against-amazon-and-hp-over-video-technology-patents-93CH-3877471,"In a recent development, Finnish multinational telecommunications company Nokia Oyj (HE: ) has launched lawsuits against Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). and HP Inc (NYSE: ). in multiple international jurisdictions. The disputes concern the unauthorized use of Nokia's video-related technologies in streaming devices and services offered by these companies. This move comes after years of unsuccessful negotiations aimed at reaching patent licensing agreements.

Arvin Patel, Nokia's Chief Licensing Officer, has stated that litigation was the only option left, as both Amazon and HP have significantly profited from Nokia's research in mobile telephony without adhering to the rules followed by other companies. This legal action is taking place against the backdrop of the European Commission's efforts to minimize such conflicts and stimulate innovation in the tech industry.

While these legal battles are underway, Nokia has silently entered into a licensing agreement with Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). The details of this agreement, however, have not been disclosed to the public.

Stocks rose on the back of Federal Reserve’s policy decision on interest rates and higher earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock on the calendar.US stocks rose on the Monday bell after a bruising sell-off last week as investors looked ahead to a big week of events, with the Federal Reserve's latest policy decision and earnings from Apple on the calendar, US media reports said.

Investors expect the Federal Reserve Chirman Jerome Powell to hold steady the interest rate hike after a series of rate increases in prior months to contain inflation at 2 per cent.

The benchmark climbed 0.7 per cent, after officially entering correction territory on Friday, while the jumped roughly 0.8 per cent, or more than 250 points, after shedding more than 350 points at its last close, reports said .

The tech-heavy was also up around 0.8 per cent amid the downbeat last week driven by mixed bag for Big Tech earnings,reports said. Investors eyes are now focused on the US central bank and Apple, the biggest company on the S&P 500, to lift their morale and spirits after a 52 week hammering of stock prices by rising yields on the US Treasury bonds, especially on the 10 year paper, which has receded since last week.

Stock brokers were also monitoring the US jobs report for October and the Labour Department’s latest update, expected Friday this week, reports said. A jump in the Fed's preferred inflation metric has raised expectations that policymakers will stick to their ""higher for longer"" stance and hold interest rates steady in their decision on Wednesday, analysts said.

Apple is set to release its quarterly results on Thursday after the market close as investors wait to see if there is any impact from China's moves to constrain use of iPhones as a retaliation to US government’s decision to restrict exports of semi-conductors chips to China. President Joe Biden issued a restrictive order on exports to China fearing the chips might be diverted for use of AI in military applications.

Nvidia, the biggest chips exporter to the world, said the impact was marginal on their business as sales volumes across the world was enormous.

Tech companies such as Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ: )), Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and others are borrowing and investing in billions in AI technologies with high expectations that it would change the cyberspace as internet did years ago. Though investments are on debt monies, stocks of these tech companies are soaring on the .

Investors are also seeing what fast foods giant McDonald's earnings would be Monday based on consumer choices as menu prices attract consumers and boost sales growth despite higher borrowing costs this quarter, analysts said.

Oil prices, which were breaching the $100 dollar markin some markets, started sliding on Israel's cautious moves on breaking into Gaza.

Fears that the conflict will escalate throughout the Middle East , which was driving prices high, eased.This has encouraged investors to dive back into markets. West Texas Intermediate futures lost 1.8 per cent to reach $84.01 a barrel, while futures shed 1.5 per cent to trade around $87.86 a barrel.

Companies including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) saw increases between 1.3% and almost 3%. The communication services and consumer discretionary sectors led the gains among the sub-indexes, each rising around 1.5%, while the technology sector saw a rise of about 1%.

McDonald's (NYSE: ) shares also climbed today, escalating by 0.7% following a surpassing of third-quarter profit and sales estimates. On the contrary, Onsemi's shares took a hit, plummeting 14.5% due to a bleak fourth-quarter revenue and profit forecast.

This rebound was influenced by investors' anticipation of the Federal Reserve's policy decision, potential impacts on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s earnings due to China's iPhone restrictions, and the October US jobs report.

Under its ""higher for longer"" policy, the Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates steady on Wednesday. This expectation comes as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation indicator, exhibited a continued cooling of prices in September. The PCE Index is a critical factor that will significantly influence the interest rate decision on Nov. 1.

In Friday's midday trading, despite early gains being reversed, the S&P 500 held steady while the Nasdaq Composite managed to rebound by approximately 0.9%. This resilience was attributed to positive earnings reports from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ), and was exhibited despite the market's movement towards correction territory. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped around 0.6%.

The resilience of US consumers was indicated by McDonald's (NYSE: ) outperforming Q3 earnings estimates despite high borrowing costs. Additionally, the de-escalating Israel-Gaza conflict led to a dip in oil prices, encouraging investors to re-enter markets.

After a tough period characterized by mixed Big Tech results and market corrections, the stock market now looks to the Federal Reserve and Apple for a potential positive turnaround.

Earnings season in full swing

The blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 2.7% in Q3 2022. If this rate holds, it will be the first quarter of YoY earnings growth reported by the index since Q3 2022, according to FactSet.

“In aggregate, the Q3 earnings season has been one of the worst in a while, not so much in terms of reported EPS vs. expectations but instead due to the totality of the reports,” analysts at Vital Knowledge added.

On September 30, the estimated YoY earnings decline for the S&P 500 for Q3 2022 was -0.3%. Nine sectors are reporting higher earnings today compared to September 30 due to positive EPS surprises and upward revisions to EPS estimates.

What analysts are saying

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our view can be boiled down to “things are so bad, they’re good”. We’re taking the commentary from CEOs/CFOs over the government’s GDP report as a measure of the economy and as a result, yields have much more downside than upside risks (the data will eventually catch up to what companies are seeing on the ground). Meanwhile, sentiment has rarely been this bleak, prices are oversold, and selling pressure is exhausted – this makes for a favorable technical setup.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “We think the S&P 500 price action into year-end is more likely to come down to where the average stock is trading rather than rallying to higher levels

because breadth typically leads price. Based on our fundamental and technical analysis, we remain comfortable with our long-standing 3,900 year-end target for the S&P 500, which implies a 17x multiple on our 2024 EPS forecast of approximately $230.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “Although we expect headwinds to discount rates and balance sheets to persist, we would view a substantial further downgrade to the growth outlook as a buying opportunity.”

BTIG’s analysts: “We have been skeptical of the seasonal rally and even if November is positive, it likely won’t be a smooth/easy rally and could very well start from a lower level… Breaking below [4130] opens the door towards 3,950-4,000. Either way it’s likely to be a November to Remember.”

Oppenheimer’s analysts: “The breach of the S&P 500’s 200-day average indicates that the correction since July hasn’t run its course. We see 4,050 as next support and, to mark improvement, we’re watching for a key reversal day, or a rally back above 4,240. Most interesting about the correction is that risk has been dragged lower by safety. This is why we believe long-term opportunity is being presented.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Absent pre-emptive rate cuts by global central banks, we see risks compounding with peak effect of restrictive monetary policy still ahead… Real rates suggest equity market is overvalued.”"

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Amazon beats - and warns

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday said came in at $0.94 per share, flattening the $0.58 estimate, on $143.1 billion in revenue vs. the $141.53B consensus.

Cloud unit Amazon Web Services sales climbed 12% to $23.1B, slightly missing estimates of $23.2B, although it also indicated that growth there was stabilizing.

The company expects total sales of $160B to $167B next quarter, under the average Street target of $167.2B.

""Overall this was a strong print & in-line with our retail margin thesis,"" said Piper Sandler, which cut the price target by $15 to $170 per share.

Citi hiked the price target by $10 to $177, citing a combination of ""attractive valuation"" and ""a structurally more profitable business.""

""We believe AWS is well positioned to deliver accelerating growth as optimization headwinds abate as Amazon gains consumer wallet share given the mix-shift to essentials, while expanding margins,"" analysts said.

At the same time, Reuters reported that the company warned that discretionary spending was weaker, saying in a call with reporters that they ""still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals.""

Shares gained some 2% for the week to $127.74.

Microsoft comes in strong

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said late Tuesday that fiscal totaled $2.99 per share on sales of $56.52B, comfortably surpassing estimates for $2.65 and $54.53B, respectively.

The company also said sales for its Azure cloud business grew 29% year over year, nicely above Wall Street estimates for a 26% climb. And on the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood said Q2 revenue should be around $60.9B (up or down $500 million), in line with the guidance.

Microsoft's investments in AI - including its famous $10B bet on OpenAI, which created the popular AI tool ChatGPT - are expected to continue to drive growth: Wedbush said it believes over half of Microsoft's installed base ""will ultimately use the AI functionality for the enterprise/commercial landscape,"" representing ""a major monetization opportunity"" that is already playing out.

2022-10-28, IANS,Google to invest $2 bn in OpenAI's rival AI company Anthropic: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-invest-2-bn-in-openais-rival-ai-company-anthropic-report-3872278,"San Francisco, Oct 28 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly investing $2 billion in AI startup company Anthropic, founded by former members of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, as the AI race heats up.The funding deal involves $500 million now and up to $1.5 billion later, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Google was yet to comment on the development.

In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10 per cent stake.

In September, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said it will invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic with a minority ownership position in the company, as competition grows in the growing generative AI market ruled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with US Vice President Kamala Harris, along with Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and OpenAI.

Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS.

As of July 2022, Anthropic had raised $1.5 billion in funding.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former senior members of OpenAI, principally Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Alphabet shares record third straight loss amid tough market conditions,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-shares-record-third-straight-loss-amid-tough-market-conditions-93CH-3872000,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. has marked its third consecutive loss in a challenging stock market environment on Friday, with its shares closing at $122.17, a drop of $19.05 from its 52-week high achieved on October 12th, 2022. This downward trend contrasts with the rising share prices of competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

The trading volume for Alphabet was notably high, with 43.7 million shares changing hands, significantly above its 50-day average of 27.5 million shares. This surge in trading activity underscores the intensity of the recent market dynamics.

The performance of Alphabet's stock is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the stock market and the performance of its peers. The company's peak value date, consecutive losses, competitors' performance, trading volumes and the overall stock market environment are key factors to consider in understanding Alphabet's current position in the market.

While Alphabet has been experiencing a downtrend, competitors Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have seen their share prices rise. This divergence in performance highlights the competitive dynamics currently at play in the tech sector.

The date of Alphabet's peak value on October 12th and the subsequent consecutive losses are significant indicators of the company's recent stock performance. However, it remains to be seen how these trends will evolve in light of the overall stock market environment and the performance of Alphabet's competitors.

The Nasdaq 100, composed of 100 non-financial stocks, is often the preferred listing platform for emerging tech companies, leading to its tech-heavy orientation. However, investors should note that the index is not exclusively tech-focused.

While the Invesco QQQ Trust is frequently favored by investors seeking broad market exposure, it carries a notable concentration risk due to its significant exposure to high-profile tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"". These stocks account for approximately one-third of the portfolio's value. About 43% of the ETF's portfolio is diversified across sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare.

In terms of costs, the Invesco QQQ Trust's 0.2% expense ratio may seem competitive when compared to actively managed mutual funds. However, it falls short when compared to other ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (ASX: ) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF which offer lower expense ratios.

Investors considering the Invesco QQQ Trust for quick access to top Nasdaq 100 stocks should weigh these factors – its concentration risk and higher expense ratio – before investing.

Chevron reported earnings of $3.05 a share on revenue of $54 billion, while Exxon reported earnings of $2.27 a share on revenue of $90.7 billion. Shares of Chevron fell more than 5%, while Exxon shares were down 1.7%.

Consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ) beat expectations and guided for full year 2022 earnings above expectations. Shares rose 1.5%.

Oil rebound on U.S. air strikes

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Cantor Fitzgerald upgrades Rivian to Overweight following recent pullback,https://in.investing.com/news/cantor-fitzgerald-upgrades-rivian-to-overweight-following-recent-pullback-432SI-3871270,"Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) to an Overweight rating (From Neutral) and reiterated their 12-month price target of $29.00 on the electric automaker’s stock after a recent pullback creates an entry opportunity for investors.

The share price has underperformed by ~27% in the past month, and is down ~12% YTD. As of Thursday’s close, RIVN’s stock trades at $16.17, with an over 79% upside.

Rivian pre-announced on October 2, that the electric automaker had manufactured 16,304 vehicles in 3Q23, surpassing the estimated 14,580 (compared to 13,992 vehicles in 2Q23). Additionally, they reported delivering 15,564 vehicles in 3Q23, exceeding the estimated 12,984 (compared to 12,460 in 2Q23).

As of the third quarter of 2022, Rivian has produced 39,691 vehicles and delivered 35,970 vehicles. Despite this, the company's annual production guidance remains unchanged at 52,000 vehicles, requiring the production of only 12,309 vehicles in Q4 to meet their target.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald believe the company will achieve and exceed its annual guidance, and models Rivian producing 14,309 vehicles in 4Q23 and 54,000 vehicles for the year.

Rivian announced on October 4 that they expect 3Q23 revenue to fall between $1.29 billion and $1.33 billion. Additionally, the company guided an anticipated 3Q23 ending cash balance of $9.1 billion.

At the same time, Rivian also announced its intention to offer green convertible senior notes with an aggregate value of $1.5B in a private offering to institutional buyers. The company said they intend to offer the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $225 million principal amount of notes.

As of 2Q23, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) owns an approximate 17% stake in RIVN, making it the largest shareholder. The two companies have a partnership for the supply of up to 100,000 Electric Delivery Vans over 10 years, contributing around 21% to total revenue in FY22 ($343M), with similar expectations for 2022.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald believe that “RIVN's partnership with Amazon is a significant differentiator.” However, their base case conservatively models the company only delivering around 70% of the total partnership agreement.

“If the company is able to deliver >70,000 EDVs, this would result in further upside that we currently do not include in our model, and we believe that it could potentially reach up to ~$7.4B in revenue through 2032E,” analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald wrote in a note.

Shares of RIVN are up 3.40% in pre-market trading Friday morning."

2022-10-27, Investing.com,"Amazon,  PCE data, Bank of Japan - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon--pce-data-bank-of-japan--whats-moving-markets-3870339,"Investing.com -- Amazon shines with its third-quarter earnings, helping push Wall Street into a positive close to the week. The Fed's favorite gauge is due later in the session, while crude prices gain on elevated Middle East tensions. Next week's Bank of Japan meeting also looms large.

1. Amazon shines in third quarter

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) was the latest of the major tech companies to report third-quarter results, and the e-commerce giant topped expectations as growth in its cloud business continued to stabilize and advertising growth jumped.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud business segment, grew revenue 12% to $23.1 billion, while advertising revenue jumped 26% to $12.06 billion from a year earlier.

""[O]ur AWS growth continued to stabilize, our advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow rose significantly,” said CEO Andy Jassy.

The company has sought to bolster its cloud presence, taking on major rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), with a deal to invest up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic, and has also reorganized its delivery network, letting it fulfill orders faster than before, and more cheaply.

Its stock jumped more than 5% premarket, with the results released after the close Thursday, even while warning that consumers remained wary about spending going into the holiday quarter.

""We still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals,"" said CFO Brian Olsavsky.

2. Futures higher, helped by strong Amazon numbers

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, ending a difficult week on a positive note after strong earnings from e-commerce giant Amazon.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 107 points or 0.3%, rose by 25 points or 0.6%, and rose by 138 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, with the tech-heavy shedding 1.8%, on course for weekly losses of about 3% and on pace for its third straight losing week.

The broad-based closed 1.2% lower, off 2% on the week, while the blue chip dropped 0.8%, its sixth negative session in seven, set for a weekly loss of 1%.

However, the tone has turned Friday following the release of strong numbers from Amazon [see above].

More earnings are due from oil giants Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) before the opening bell, as well as from consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: ).

3. Fed’s favorite inflation gauge due

The U.S. is seen as a near certainty to pause on further interest rate hikes at its meeting next week, but Thursday's unexpectedly strong reading on third quarter has created an element of doubt over December’s meeting.

This means Friday's report on inflation in the form of the will carry extra significance, given the reading of which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.

Analysts expect the September headline reading to rise 3.4% for the year and 0.3% for the month, while the core PCE, which strips out fuel and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.7% for the year and 0.3% for the month.

Fed Chair was at pains to point out last week that above-trend economic growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""

With the GDP data surprising to the upside, any indications that inflation is starting to grow again could change the narrative surrounding further Fed decisions.

4. BOJ meeting looms large

Next week sees central bank policy-setting meetings in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. While the Fed gathering always attracts the most attention, it may well be officials that have the most to discuss.

The Japanese central bank will face growing pressure to shift further away from its controversial bond yield control, amid rising global bond yields and persistent inflation.

The BOJ has been laying the groundwork for an eventual end to negative interest rates, but this meeting is expected to be too early for such a move with BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda warning of the fallout from slowing global growth.

That said, rose 3.3% on the year in October, remaining persistently above the central bank’s 2% target, while the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has seen the yen trade above 150 against the U.S. dollar, near the three-decade low of 151.94 that prompted government intervention a year ago.

A weak yen tends to boost imported food and fuel prices.

5. Crude rises on U.S. strikes on Syria

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

By 04:45 ET, the futures traded 2% higher at $84.89 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2% to $89.70 a barrel.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far."

The also fell by over 366 points to close at 32,417.59. This market downturn, primarily due to soaring Treasury yields and various economic and geopolitical issues, has caused concern among Americans as it may impact the performance of numerous mutual funds that benchmark against these indices.

Despite the broader market downturn, shares of tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose last week. Amazon's shares increased by over 6% following positive investor sentiment towards its Q3 update and Q4 forecast. The positive sentiment towards Amazon led to a rise in shares for Microsoft and Apple as well, with Apple set to release its quarterly figures soon.

However, not all tech stocks fared well. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: ) all saw weekly losses. Alphabet witnessed a near 10% slump, Nvidia lost around 2% weekly, while Netflix dipped slightly by 0.7%.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE: ) shares fell over concerns about its quarterly figures and its $US53 agreed bid for Hess Corporation (NYSE: ), registering a weekly loss of more than 13%.

Amid these market fluctuations, Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting emerged as a significant stakeholder in Azure Minerals, potentially frustrating SQM's $1.6 billion bid for the same. The proposed merger between Australian Unity Diversified Property Fund and Cromwell Direct Property Fund was abandoned due to volatility in commercial property asset values.

Macquarie Group (OTC: ) is also set to release weak half-year results.

Despite the recent market correction, financial experts like Ryan Detrick from Carson Group emphasize that such market corrections are normal, transient, and less severe than a bear market.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Amazon beats - and warns

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday said came in at $0.94 per share, flattening the $0.58 estimate, on $143.1 billion in revenue vs. the $141.53B consensus.

Cloud unit Amazon Web Services sales climbed 12% to $23.1B, slightly missing estimates of $23.2B, although it also indicated that growth there was stabilizing.

The company expects total sales of $160B to $167B next quarter, under the average Street target of $167.2B.

""Overall this was a strong print & in-line with our retail margin thesis,"" said Piper Sandler, which cut the price target by $15 to $170 per share.

Citi hiked the price target by $10 to $177, citing a combination of ""attractive valuation"" and ""a structurally more profitable business.""

""We believe AWS is well positioned to deliver accelerating growth as optimization headwinds abate as Amazon gains consumer wallet share given the mix-shift to essentials, while expanding margins,"" analysts said.

At the same time, Reuters reported that the company warned that discretionary spending was weaker, saying in a call with reporters that they ""still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals.""

Shares gained some 2% for the week to $127.74.

Microsoft comes in strong

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said late Tuesday that fiscal totaled $2.99 per share on sales of $56.52B, comfortably surpassing estimates for $2.65 and $54.53B, respectively.

The company also said sales for its Azure cloud business grew 29% year over year, nicely above Wall Street estimates for a 26% climb. And on the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood said Q2 revenue should be around $60.9B (up or down $500 million), in line with the guidance.

Microsoft's investments in AI - including its famous $10B bet on OpenAI, which created the popular AI tool ChatGPT - are expected to continue to drive growth: Wedbush said it believes over half of Microsoft's installed base ""will ultimately use the AI functionality for the enterprise/commercial landscape,"" representing ""a major monetization opportunity"" that is already playing out.

Citi, meanwhile, said the report ""checked all the boxes"" and believes the results indicate ""demand trends are stabilizing (or accelerating) and should offer a positive read on the outlook.""

And Goldman Sachs expects earnings growth acceleration triggered by heightened gross margin leverage in fiscal 2025, raising Microsoft's price target by $50 to $450.

Shares lifted some 1% for the week to $329.81.

Alphabet weaker under the hood

On the flip side, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) shares took a big hit after the Google parent reported top- and bottom-line beats but also said cloud revenue rose just 22% to $8.4B, short of expectations for $8.6 billion, and slightly lower-than-expected operating income of $21.34B.

Overall, came in at $1.55 a share, $0.09 over estimates, on 11% higher revenue of $76.7B that beat the $75.9B average expectation.

The management attributed the disappointing cloud sales to client optimization.

Bernstein said that both popular bull cases for GOOGL - ""cloud taking share offering further AI re-rating"" and ""visible"" expansion in margins - ""suddenly... feel very distant.""

The analysts added, ""Top-line tracking well, but margin contraction and a soft cloud print weighs heavily on the question 'why buy Google here?'""

Several Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on GOOGL stock in response to the Q3 earnings report.

GOOGL shares plummeted about 10% for the week, closing Friday at $122.17.

Meta tops targets but indicates soft ad demand in current quarter

Meta (NASDAQ: ) reported better-than-expected and stronger guidance for the current quarter as cost cuts boosted margins, but shares lost ground after the earnings call, when management reported softening brand advertising demand at the beginning of Q4.

""While we don't have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook,"" CFO Susan Li said on the call.

In terms of overall earnings and revenue, Meta reported adjusted EPS of $4.39 - smashing the $3.64 average target - on a top line of $34.15B vs. analysts' expectation for $33.57B.

Total costs and expenses were $20.40 billion, down 7% from the prior year, boosting the company's operating margin to 40% in Q3 from 20% a year earlier.

Looking ahead, the company said it expects third quarter revenue to be in the range of $36.5B to $40B, a range that's mostly above the anticipated $38.84B.

Oppenheimer reiterated its bullish view on Meta on ""3Q's continued revenue outperformance and cost control, despite conservative low end of 4Q guide on Middle East.""

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) continues to ""see META as well-positioned against several long-term secular growth themes and are encouraged by the positive momentum across key product initiatives incl. Reels, click-to-messaging Ads and AI including Advantage+ adoption.""

Shares were off some 4% for the week to $296.73.

Intel's rosy forecast

Intel (NASDAQ: ), amid signs PC demand has bottomed, delivered better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter as well as adjusted of $0.41 - nearly double the $0.22 target - on better-than-anticipated sales of $14.2B.

Q4 adjusted EPS is expected at $0.44 on revenue of between $14.6B and $15.6B, says the company, well ahead of estimates for EPS of $0.33 on revenue of $14.36B.

HSBC upgraded the stock's rating to Hold from Reduce on the news, with a price target of $33, citing expectations for ""significant earnings revisions from better execution and improving PC outlook to lead to a re-rating.""

Bernstein boosted the price target to $36 on the ""quite strong"" results, writing, ""Overall the company does appear to have turned the corner on the worst of it, and (perhaps) a PC-dominated narrative might be enough to carry it for the moment.""

Shares gained nearly 2% for the week to $35.54.

2022-10-28, IANS,Google to invest $2 bn in OpenAI's rival AI company Anthropic: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-invest-2-bn-in-openais-rival-ai-company-anthropic-report-3872278,"San Francisco, Oct 28 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly investing $2 billion in AI startup company Anthropic, founded by former members of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, as the AI race heats up.The funding deal involves $500 million now and up to $1.5 billion later, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Google was yet to comment on the development.

In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10 per cent stake.

In September, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said it will invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic with a minority ownership position in the company, as competition grows in the growing generative AI market ruled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with US Vice President Kamala Harris, along with Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and OpenAI.

Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS.

As of July 2022, Anthropic had raised $1.5 billion in funding.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former senior members of OpenAI, principally Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.

This downward trend contrasts with the rising share prices of competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

The trading volume for Alphabet was notably high, with 43.7 million shares changing hands, significantly above its 50-day average of 27.5 million shares. This surge in trading activity underscores the intensity of the recent market dynamics.

The performance of Alphabet's stock is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the stock market and the performance of its peers. The company's peak value date, consecutive losses, competitors' performance, trading volumes and the overall stock market environment are key factors to consider in understanding Alphabet's current position in the market.

While Alphabet has been experiencing a downtrend, competitors Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have seen their share prices rise. This divergence in performance highlights the competitive dynamics currently at play in the tech sector.

The date of Alphabet's peak value on October 12th and the subsequent consecutive losses are significant indicators of the company's recent stock performance. However, it remains to be seen how these trends will evolve in light of the overall stock market environment and the performance of Alphabet's competitors.

The Nasdaq 100, composed of 100 non-financial stocks, is often the preferred listing platform for emerging tech companies, leading to its tech-heavy orientation. However, investors should note that the index is not exclusively tech-focused.

While the Invesco QQQ Trust is frequently favored by investors seeking broad market exposure, it carries a notable concentration risk due to its significant exposure to high-profile tech stocks such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"". These stocks account for approximately one-third of the portfolio's value. About 43% of the ETF's portfolio is diversified across sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare.

In terms of costs, the Invesco QQQ Trust's 0.2% expense ratio may seem competitive when compared to actively managed mutual funds. However, it falls short when compared to other ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: ) ETF Trust (ASX: ) and Vanguard Information Technology ETF which offer lower expense ratios.

Investors considering the Invesco QQQ Trust for quick access to top Nasdaq 100 stocks should weigh these factors – its concentration risk and higher expense ratio – before investing.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Tech stocks rebound after Amazon report;  consumer spending tops estimates,https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-tick-higher-intel-up-8-amazon-lifts-44-after-earnings-3869832,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were mixed on Friday after an inflation report that came in mostly as expected and as tech stocks tried to regain some ground after a sharp sell off on Thursday.

At 10:37 ET (14:37 GMT), the was down 102 points or 0.3%, while the was up 0.1% and the was up 0.8%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, with the tech-heavy shedding 1.8%, on course for weekly losses of about 3% and on pace for its third straight losing week.

The broad-based S&P closed 1.2% lower, off 2% for the week, while the blue chip Dow dropped 0.8%, its sixth negative session in seven, set for a weekly loss of 1%.

September PCE index to guide the Fed

Friday's report on inflation comes in the form of the , the reading of which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.

The September personal consumption expenditures index, or , rose 3.4% as expected for the year and 0.4% for the month, while the core PCE, which strips out fuel and energy prices, rose 3.7% for the year and 0.3% for the month. surged 0.7%, compared with the expected 0.5%.

The futures market still thinks the Federal Reserve is likely to pause on another interest rate hike when it meets next week despite Thursday's stronger than expected report on gross domestic product for the third quarter, which was fueled by consumer spending.

Amazon’s earnings boost confidence

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) offered up quarterly earnings after the close Thursday that went a long way to securing its position as the world's biggest cloud provider and online retailer.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud business segment, grew revenue 12% to $23.1 billion, while advertising revenue jumped 26% to $12.06 billion from a year earlier. Shares rose more than 7%.

Additionally, chip manufacturer Intel (NASDAQ: ) delivered better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter after third-quarter earnings markedly beat analyst estimates amid signs PC demand has bottomed out. Shares jumped 9.9%.

These positive results have boosted overall confidence at the end of what has been a difficult week on Wall Street.

Oil giants report

The earnings focus turns Friday away from the tech sector and towards the big energy companies.

Oil giants Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) missed expectations as results compared unfavorably to last year's record earnings. Chevron reported earnings of $3.05 a share on revenue of $54 billion, while Exxon reported earnings of $2.27 a share on revenue of $90.7 billion. Shares of Chevron fell more than 5%, while Exxon shares were down 1.7%.

Consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ) beat expectations and guided for full year 2022 earnings above expectations. Shares rose 1.5%.

Oil rebound on U.S. air strikes

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Cantor Fitzgerald upgrades Rivian to Overweight following recent pullback,https://in.investing.com/news/cantor-fitzgerald-upgrades-rivian-to-overweight-following-recent-pullback-432SI-3871270,"Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) to an Overweight rating (From Neutral) and reiterated their 12-month price target of $29.00 on the electric automaker’s stock after a recent pullback creates an entry opportunity for investors.

The share price has underperformed by ~27% in the past month, and is down ~12% YTD. As of Thursday’s close, RIVN’s stock trades at $16.17, with an over 79% upside.

Rivian pre-announced on October 2, that the electric automaker had manufactured 16,304 vehicles in 3Q23, surpassing the estimated 14,580 (compared to 13,992 vehicles in 2Q23). Additionally, they reported delivering 15,564 vehicles in 3Q23, exceeding the estimated 12,984 (compared to 12,460 in 2Q23).

As of the third quarter of 2022, Rivian has produced 39,691 vehicles and delivered 35,970 vehicles. Despite this, the company's annual production guidance remains unchanged at 52,000 vehicles, requiring the production of only 12,309 vehicles in Q4 to meet their target.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald believe the company will achieve and exceed its annual guidance, and models Rivian producing 14,309 vehicles in 4Q23 and 54,000 vehicles for the year.

Rivian announced on October 4 that they expect 3Q23 revenue to fall between $1.29 billion and $1.33 billion. Additionally, the company guided an anticipated 3Q23 ending cash balance of $9.1 billion.

At the same time, Rivian also announced its intention to offer green convertible senior notes with an aggregate value of $1.5B in a private offering to institutional buyers. The company said they intend to offer the initial purchasers of the notes an option to buy up to an additional $225 million principal amount of notes.

As of 2Q23, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) owns an approximate 17% stake in RIVN, making it the largest shareholder. The two companies have a partnership for the supply of up to 100,000 Electric Delivery Vans over 10 years, contributing around 21% to total revenue in FY22 ($343M), with similar expectations for 2022.

Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald believe that “RIVN's partnership with Amazon is a significant differentiator.” However, their base case conservatively models the company only delivering around 70% of the total partnership agreement.

“If the company is able to deliver >70,000 EDVs, this would result in further upside that we currently do not include in our model, and we believe that it could potentially reach up to ~$7.4B in revenue through 2032E,” analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald wrote in a note.

Shares of RIVN are up 3.40% in pre-market trading Friday morning."

2022-10-27, Investing.com,"Amazon,  PCE data, Bank of Japan - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon--pce-data-bank-of-japan--whats-moving-markets-3870339,"Investing.com -- Amazon shines with its third-quarter earnings, helping push Wall Street into a positive close to the week. The Fed's favorite gauge is due later in the session, while crude prices gain on elevated Middle East tensions. Next week's Bank of Japan meeting also looms large.

1. Amazon shines in third quarter

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) was the latest of the major tech companies to report third-quarter results, and the e-commerce giant topped expectations as growth in its cloud business continued to stabilize and advertising growth jumped.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud business segment, grew revenue 12% to $23.1 billion, while advertising revenue jumped 26% to $12.06 billion from a year earlier.

""[O]ur AWS growth continued to stabilize, our advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow rose significantly,” said CEO Andy Jassy.

The company has sought to bolster its cloud presence, taking on major rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), with a deal to invest up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic, and has also reorganized its delivery network, letting it fulfill orders faster than before, and more cheaply.

Its stock jumped more than 5% premarket, with the results released after the close Thursday, even while warning that consumers remained wary about spending going into the holiday quarter.

""We still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals,"" said CFO Brian Olsavsky.

2. Futures higher, helped by strong Amazon numbers

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, ending a difficult week on a positive note after strong earnings from e-commerce giant Amazon.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 107 points or 0.3%, rose by 25 points or 0.6%, and rose by 138 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, with the tech-heavy shedding 1.8%, on course for weekly losses of about 3% and on pace for its third straight losing week.

The broad-based closed 1.2% lower, off 2% on the week, while the blue chip dropped 0.8%, its sixth negative session in seven, set for a weekly loss of 1%.

However, the tone has turned Friday following the release of strong numbers from Amazon [see above].

More earnings are due from oil giants Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) before the opening bell, as well as from consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: ).

3. Fed’s favorite inflation gauge due

The U.S. is seen as a near certainty to pause on further interest rate hikes at its meeting next week, but Thursday's unexpectedly strong reading on third quarter has created an element of doubt over December’s meeting.

This means Friday's report on inflation in the form of the will carry extra significance, given the reading of which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.

Analysts expect the September headline reading to rise 3.4% for the year and 0.3% for the month, while the core PCE, which strips out fuel and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.7% for the year and 0.3% for the month.

Fed Chair was at pains to point out last week that above-trend economic growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""

With the GDP data surprising to the upside, any indications that inflation is starting to grow again could change the narrative surrounding further Fed decisions.

4. BOJ meeting looms large

Next week sees central bank policy-setting meetings in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. While the Fed gathering always attracts the most attention, it may well be officials that have the most to discuss.

The Japanese central bank will face growing pressure to shift further away from its controversial bond yield control, amid rising global bond yields and persistent inflation.

The BOJ has been laying the groundwork for an eventual end to negative interest rates, but this meeting is expected to be too early for such a move with BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda warning of the fallout from slowing global growth.

That said, rose 3.3% on the year in October, remaining persistently above the central bank’s 2% target, while the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has seen the yen trade above 150 against the U.S. dollar, near the three-decade low of 151.94 that prompted government intervention a year ago.

A weak yen tends to boost imported food and fuel prices.

5. Crude rises on U.S. strikes on Syria

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

By 04:45 ET, the futures traded 2% higher at $84.89 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2% to $89.70 a barrel.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far."

2022-10-27, IANS,Sundar Pichai to testify in US vs Google anti-trust case on Oct 30,https://in.investing.com/news/sundar-pichai-to-testify-in-us-vs-google-antitrust-case-on-oct-30-3870014,"San Francisco, Oct 27 (IANS) Sundar Pichai is set to testify in the US vs Google (NASDAQ: ) anti-trust case on October 30, sharing his side of the story on how Google’s search is successful owing to its own innovation and not deals with the big companies. Pichai will testify in the ongoing antitrust trial in the suit brought by the US Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general.

They have alleged that Google abused its dominance in the search engine market.

Pichai will be one of the first witnesses Google calls for its antitrust defense, which started officially on Thursday.

“Judge Amit Mehta just broke some news from the bench: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai will be testifying for Google on Monday,” the X account titled ‘Big Tech on Trial’ posted.

On Thursday, top Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan testified in the case, and touched upon a number of the key issues.

“He testified about the emphasis Google places on R&D and innovation, disputing the notion that Google’s search product is higher quality in countries other than the US where it faces increased competition,” the X account further posted.

Raghavan also testified that Google faces intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

He disagreed with the Department of Justice’s standpoint of Google as a “one-stop shop” because he thinks it’s not how users think about their searches.

When asked about a 1998 article about Yahoo!'s dominance of search, Raghavan said he was aware rivals from Expedia.com to Instagram to TikTok competed for users' attention.

""I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill,"" said Raghavan who reports to Pichai. Raghavan is a Senior Vice President at Google, responsible for Google Search, Assistant, Geo, Ads, Commerce and Payments products.

The apprehension around AWS was sparked by recent cloud results from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), particularly due to Google's slowdown.

Thomas Champion, an analyst at Piper Sandler, anticipates 'flattish' AWS growth instead of a Q3 bounce-back. Despite the potential turbulence, Amazon's earnings per share are projected to increase from last year's 28 cents to 59 cents. Furthermore, revenue is forecasted to rise from $127.1 billion to $141.5 billion.

While the FTC lawsuit and AWS performance concerns loom, the majority of analysts remain optimistic about Amazon. The company's stock has remained unchanged over the past year but has experienced a substantial 44% surge this year. This optimism suggests that despite immediate challenges, market watchers still see potential in the e-commerce giant's performance.

Third quarter U.S. GDP in focus

Third quarter came in at a hotter than expected 4.9% for the third quarter from the previous quarter. At the expected 4.3%, it would have been the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

In addition, new of 210,000 last week were slightly higher than the expected 208,000 and up from the prior week. And rose 1.1% in September from the prior month, a turnaround from the decline of 7.1% the month before.

Amazon takes the earnings lead

The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected after the closing bell.

The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) met expectations for profit and said it would slow capacity growth in 2024. Shares fell 0.5%. United Parcel Service (NYSE: ) fell slightly below expectations for revenue, and shares were down 4%.

Meta Platforms disappoints on revenue guidance

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.

1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up

It was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.

Meta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.

Additionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.

However, Meta’s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company’s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.

Earnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session’s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and slipped by 140 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.

The tech-heavy fell 2.4%, recording its worst day since February, while the broad-based dropped 1.4% and the blue chip fell 0.3%.

The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results due from e-commerce giant Amazon the highlight [see above].

Numbers are also due from the likes of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE: ), carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ), auto giant Ford (NYSE: ) and Mexican fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE: ).

There are a number of economic indicators due Thursday, headlined by the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product [see below].

September , , and retail inventory numbers and weekly will be published at the same time as the GDP report.

3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak

The meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to pause its rate-hiking cycle after raising interest rates at its past 10 meetings.

The central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.

A weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.

However, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB’s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.

""The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.

4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly

The Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter , due out later in the session.

GDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

This expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.

However, the is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.

5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise

Crude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session’s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.

The benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.

U.S. climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world’s largest consumer.

After the wave of enthusiasm for artificial intelligence in the tech sector, earnings reports are showing that some companies are ahead of others. While Alphabet's cloud revenue rose in the quarter, it didn't rise as much as analysts had forecast as the parent of Google continues to build out its AI capabilities to compete with other cloud services providers. At the same time, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s cloud revenue notched a strong showing.

Tech investors have also been beaten down by sharply rising interest rates in recent weeks, with the 10-year Treasury hitting over 5% this week before drifting lower. But Wednesday's selloff in the Nasdaq -- on pace for its worst performance in months -- could bring the dip buyers back in.

Analysts are watching to see what happens at next week's meeting at the Federal Reserve, which is expected to hold interest rates steady when it issues its decision on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell's press conference remarks that afternoon will be closely scrutinized for the Fed's thinking heading into the end of the year. The Fed will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product, due out Thursday, and the September reading on inflation in the form of the personal consumption expenditures index.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Amazon reports

E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion. Analysts will be listening to what it says about the upcoming holiday sales season.

2. Merck (NS: ) earnings

Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.95 on revenue of $15.3 billion.

3. Southwest Air reports

Carrier Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE: ) is expected to report earnings per share of 38 cents on revenue of $6.56 billion, and analysts will be listening to what executives say about travel demand and fuel costs."

New AI capabilities make it easier for sellers to write engaging, effective product listings, and help shoppers find what they are looking for, the company said in a statement.

“At Amazon Ads, we are always thinking about ways we can reduce friction for our advertisers, provide them with tools that deliver more impact while minimizing effort, and ultimately, deliver a better advertising experience for our customers,” said Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of Amazon Ads Products and Technology.

Amazon Ads has launched image generation in beta — a generative AI solution designed to remove creative barriers and enable brands to produce lifestyle imagery that helps improve their ads’ performance.

This solution is helpful for advertisers of all sizes, said the company. The image generation capability is easy to use and requires no technical expertise.

In the Amazon Ad Console, advertisers simply select their product and click Generate, with the tool leveraging generative AI to deliver a set of lifestyle and brand-themed images, based on product details, in a matter of seconds.

The image can then be refined by entering short text prompts, while multiple versions can be quickly created and tested to optimise performance, said Amazon.

In a March 2022 survey, Amazon had found that among advertisers who were unable to build successful campaigns, nearly 75 per cent cited building ad creatives and choosing a creative format as their biggest challenges.

The underperformance of Alphabet's cloud division, which marked its slowest growth in over 11 quarters, led to a 6.6% drop in the company's shares in premarket trading. Despite this setback, Alphabet still surpassed overall earnings and revenue expectations.

Microsoft, on the other hand, witnessed a 3.6% rise in its shares following robust Q1 results across all segments. The company's successful AI investments and strong performance of its cloud business have been identified as key contributors to this positive outcome.

The day also saw other mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) experiencing decreases of 0.8%, 0.5%, and 1.3% respectively due to the rise in long-dated U.S Treasury yields nearing the critical 5% level.

Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s recent success is seen as an indication of continued consumer spending on streaming services. This trend bodes well for Amazon's Prime Video, YouTube parent company Alphabet, and Apple. Buzzworthy programs like Ted Lasso have been instrumental in keeping viewers engaged.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Amazon to Launch AWS European Sovereign Cloud,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-to-launch-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-432SI-3865620,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (AMZN), today announced it will launch the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, a new, independent cloud for Europe designed to help public sector customers and those in highly regulated industries meet the most stringent regulatory data residency and operational requirements. Located and operated within Europe, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, with the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions, giving customers additional choice to meet their data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers.

As with existing AWS Regions, customers will have the control and assurance that AWS will not access or use customer data for any purpose without their agreement, as well as access to the strongest sovereignty controls among leading cloud providers. Only EU-resident AWS employees who are located in the EU will have control of the operations and support for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. For customers with enhanced data residency needs, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will allow customers to keep all metadata they create (such as the roles, permissions, resource labels, and configurations they use to run AWS) in the EU, and will feature its own billing and usage metering systems.

“The AWS European Sovereign Cloud reinforces our commitment to offering AWS customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls, privacy safeguards, and security features available in the cloud,” said Max Peterson, vice president of Sovereign Cloud at AWS. “For more than a decade, we’ve worked with governments and regulatory bodies across Europe to understand and meet evolving needs in cybersecurity, data privacy and localization, and more recently, digital sovereignty. With this new offering, customers and Partners across Europe will have more choice to achieve the operational independence they require, without compromising on the broadest and deepest cloud services that millions of customers already know and use today.”

“The development of a European AWS cloud will make it much easier for many public sector organizations and companies with high data security and data protection requirements to use AWS services,” said Claudia Plattner, president, German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). “We are aware of the innovative power of modern cloud services, and we want to help make them securely available for Germany and Europe. The C5 (Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue), which was developed by the BSI, has significantly shaped cybersecurity cloud standards, and AWS was, in fact, the first cloud service provider to receive the BSI’s C5 testate. In this respect, we are very pleased to constructively accompany the local development of an AWS cloud, which will also contribute to European sovereignty, in terms of security.”

The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be sovereign-by-design and will be built on more than a decade of AWS’s experience operating multiple independent clouds for the most critical and restricted workloads. Customers who need more options to address stringent isolation and in-country data residency needs will be able to leverage existing offerings like AWS Outposts or AWS Dedicated Local Zones to deploy AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure in locations they select. AWS Outposts are fully managed solutions that deliver AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a consistent hybrid experience. They are designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency, data processing, and data residency requirements, where customers want those workloads to run seamlessly with their other workloads in AWS. AWS Dedicated Local Zones are a type of infrastructure built for exclusive use by a customer or community and placed in a customer-specified location. They are designed to reduce the operational overhead of managing on-premises infrastructure at scale, and can be configured to meet a customer’s specific regulatory requirements.

AWS European Sovereign Cloud customers will benefit from the same low latency and high availability they expect from existing AWS Regions, and from access to the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud to drive innovation. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will offer multiple Availability Zones, infrastructure that is placed in separate and distinct geographic locations, with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting customers’ business continuity, yet near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks.

AWS offers the largest and most comprehensive cloud infrastructure globally, with 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, and has plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Canada, Germany, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS infrastructure in Europe currently includes eight AWS Regions in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, Spain, and Zurich and more than 120 Content Distribution Network (CDN) points of presence in more than 25 cities across 19 European Member States. Some of the largest AWS development teams are located in Europe, with key centers in Dublin, Dresden, and Berlin. Today, Amazon is creating thousands of high-quality jobs and investing billions of euros in European economies. Across the EU, Amazon has created more than 100,000 permanent jobs, and many major components of AWS, including the AWS Nitro System and Amazon CloudWatch, are built in the EU. AWS European Sovereign Cloud will drive economic development through investing in infrastructure, jobs, and skills in communities and countries across Europe. As part of a continued commitment to contribute to the development of digital skills, AWS will hire and develop additional local personnel to operate and support the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

Customers, AWS Partners, and regulators welcome AWS European Sovereign Cloud

Organizations across the European Union are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. AWS provides the most comprehensive compliance controls, supporting 143 security standards and compliance certifications, to help customers satisfy regulatory requirements around the globe. To meet additional data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs in Europe, AWS is collaborating closely with European regulators and national cybersecurity agencies to build the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Many regulators, customers, and AWS Partners across Europe welcome the new AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

“We welcome the commitment of AWS to expand its infrastructure with an independent European cloud. This will give businesses and public sector organizations more choice in meeting digital sovereignty requirements,” said Dr. Markus Richter, chief information officer of the German federal government. “Cloud services are essential for the digitization of the public administration. With the ‘German Administration Cloud Strategy’ and the ‘EVB-IT Cloud’ contract standard, the foundations for cloud use in the public administration have been established. I am very pleased to work together with AWS to practically and collaboratively implement sovereignty in line with our cloud strategy.”

“The German and European economies are on course for digitization. The strong German ‘Mittelstand’ which are small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular need a sovereign digital infrastructure that meets the highest requirements in order to continue to be competitive in the global market,” said Stefan Schnorr, state secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport. “For our digital independence, it is important that computing power is generated locally in Germany and that further investments are made in the digitalization of the local economy. We therefore welcome the announcement by AWS to locate the European cloud in Germany.”

“AWS’s announcement of an independent European cloud will provide organizations facing the most stringent regulations with more choice in their digital sovereignty strategy,” said Jarkko Levasma, Finland Government chief information officer at the Ministry of Finance. “In order to successfully provide human-centric and secure services to citizens and businesses, public sector agencies need to have cloud solutions that are compatible with data protection and other legislation.”

“Data sovereignty and residency are now at the forefront of European and national security debates. Therefore, AWS’s announcement of an independent European cloud is indeed the right decision at the right time that will ultimately also bolster transatlantic collaboration,” said Tomas Krejci, deputy director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) in the Czech Republic. “We acknowledge that it will provide more heavily regulated organizations, such as those in the public sector with an eye on evolving regulation, more choice in their digital sovereignty strategy. A totally independent cloud, which delivers appropriate levels of cyber security together with the assurance of meeting stringent data protection requirements, will always benefit both public sector agencies and citizens at large.”

“We welcome the announcement by AWS to further enhance its current European infrastructure footprint with a new independent cloud. This will help public and private organizations navigating stringent regulatory requirements to accelerate their transition to the cloud while improving innovation and data security for the benefit of European citizens,” said Dan Cimpean, director of the National Cyber Security Directorate of Romania. “As Romania is championing the development of cybersecurity skills and competencies and hosting the European Cybersecurity Competence Center, we welcome this move by AWS also as a long-term investment in cloud and security skills in Europe.”

2022-10-24, Investing.com,Amazon mulls offering veterinary telehealth - CNBC,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-mulls-offering-veterinary-telehealth--cnbc-432SI-3864298,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is said to be mulling an expansion into veterinary telehealth, CNBC reported Tuesday, in its latest bid to compete with Walmart (NYSE: ).

The publication said people familiar with the matter informed them of the news. Amazon has already made its move into human health, acquiring One Medical. While the company is a strong player in the pet food market, it has yet to meaningfully invest in pet health.

Walmart began offering veterinary telehealth to Walmart+ subscribers earlier this year. Like human telehealth, veterinary telehealth lets pet owners have virtual appointments with veterinarians and veterinary technicians.

CNBC added that Walmart signed a deal with veterinary telehealth provider Pawp and that Amazon could do the same, with Pawp having already proven it can scale with a large retailer. However, they also said the e-commerce giant could partner with other pet telehealth startups on the market or build its own practice."

The analysts comment ""Our View: Based on intra-quarter data points and our model sensitivity analysis, we view the Street’s Q3 Revenue (+11% Y/Y and +5% Q/Q), Operating Income (implying 5.3% margin) and AWS Revenue (+12.5% Y/Y and 4% Q/Q) estimates as reasonable, given our positive channel checks suggesting Cloud demand acceleration (in H2 and into ’24). As for Q4, we view the Street’s Total Revenue (12% Y/Y, 18% Q/Q) and Operating Income estimates (implying 5.2% margin) as at least bracketable. Overall, we see an attractive risk-reward set-up for Amazon heading into the Q3 print, given very reasonable Street estimates for topline growth and N.A. Retail Op margin assumptions (3% margin for Q3), relatively conservative buyside expectations for AWS growth, and our checks that suggest a recovering/accelerating Cloud spending environment that should persist into ’24 (which we believe the market is not giving AMZN full credit for), and improving fulfillment capacity utilization (i.e. Retail Op Margin expansion). Our Stock Call: We have a Tactical Outperform on AMZN AND it’s our Top Large Cap ‘Net Long. We particularly like the riskreward heading into the Q3 EPS print, given reasonably low expectations.

2022-10-24, IANS,Amazon rolls out passwordless sign-ins for users on iOS and web,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-rolls-out-passwordless-signins-for-users-on-ios-and-web-3863210,"New Delhi, Oct 24 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is rolling out passkey support on browsers and mobile shopping apps (iOS users), making it easier and safer for the customers to access their accounts with passwordless sign-in.Customers can now set up passkeys in their Amazon settings, allowing them to use the same face, fingerprint, or PIN used to unlock their device.

“This is about giving customers ease-of-use and security simultaneously in their Amazon experience,” said Dave Treadwell, senior vice president of ecommerce at Amazon.

“While passwords will still be around in the foreseeable future, this is an exciting step in the right direction. We are thrilled to be an early adopter of this new authentication method, helping to realize our vision for a more secure, passwordless internet,” Treadwell added.

Passkey support is available for all Amazon customers using browsers and is gradually rolling out on the iOS Amazon Shopping app with support coming soon on the Android Amazon Shopping app, the e-commerce giant said in a statement late on Monday.

Unlike passwords, passkeys cannot be written down or guessed, helping to prevent the accidental sharing of a passkey with a hacker.

“When a customer uses a passkey on their device, it proves they have their device and are able to unlock it. Customers no longer need to worry about remembering unique passwords or using easy-to-guess identifiers, like names or birthdays,” said Amazon.

A customer can use passkeys to sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices -- with a fingerprint, face scan, or lock screen PIN.

Passkeys are also less susceptible to phishing attacks than passwords and one-time codes in text messages, making them a more secure option, said the company.

The companies have added nearly $4tn to their market capitalization in 2022 alone, overshadowing the $3.4tn increase for the entire MSCI index. This significant influence has even affected markets abroad, with the facing a potential decline without their contributions.

Today, US companies account for 61% of the $60tn MSCI index, a considerable rise from less than 50% a decade ago. The ten largest stocks now constitute almost 19% of the index, a substantial increase from 8% in 2013.

However, global stocks have experienced instability over recent months due to concerns about interest rates and geopolitical risks such as the Israel-Hamas conflict. US stocks currently trade at about 18 times their expected earnings over the next year, compared to 12 times for the MSCI all-country excluding US stocks.

In this climate, Max Gokhman from Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and Jurrien Timmer from Fidelity have both suggested that non-US stocks being cheaper does not necessarily mean they will outperform. They caution that the ""magnificent seven"" could face pressure if they fail to demonstrate tangible benefits from AI growth next year. However, they also suggest that growth stocks could see benefits when interest rates start to decline.

In related news, OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, is currently discussing a share sale with investors that would value it at about $86bn, tripling its value since April.

The ongoing dominance of US firms in global markets has sparked concerns about a potential US monopoly. This could potentially drain liquidity from other markets and incentivize companies to relocate their listings for higher valuations and trading volumes in the US.

Despite Tesla's disappointing results causing a 10% stock drop, the remaining six tech giants show promise despite macroeconomic concerns like rising bond yields, inflation fears, and the Israel-Hamas war's oil price impact.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

Pichai will testify in the ongoing antitrust trial in the suit brought by the US Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general.

They have alleged that Google abused its dominance in the search engine market.

Pichai will be one of the first witnesses Google calls for its antitrust defense, which started officially on Thursday.

“Judge Amit Mehta just broke some news from the bench: Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai will be testifying for Google on Monday,” the X account titled ‘Big Tech on Trial’ posted.

On Thursday, top Google executive Prabhakar Raghavan testified in the case, and touched upon a number of the key issues.

“He testified about the emphasis Google places on R&D and innovation, disputing the notion that Google’s search product is higher quality in countries other than the US where it faces increased competition,” the X account further posted.

Raghavan also testified that Google faces intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

He disagreed with the Department of Justice’s standpoint of Google as a “one-stop shop” because he thinks it’s not how users think about their searches.

When asked about a 1998 article about Yahoo!'s dominance of search, Raghavan said he was aware rivals from Expedia.com to Instagram to TikTok competed for users' attention.

""I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill,"" said Raghavan who reports to Pichai. Raghavan is a Senior Vice President at Google, responsible for Google Search, Assistant, Geo, Ads, Commerce and Payments products.

The apprehension around AWS was sparked by recent cloud results from Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), particularly due to Google's slowdown.

Thomas Champion, an analyst at Piper Sandler, anticipates 'flattish' AWS growth instead of a Q3 bounce-back. Despite the potential turbulence, Amazon's earnings per share are projected to increase from last year's 28 cents to 59 cents. Furthermore, revenue is forecasted to rise from $127.1 billion to $141.5 billion.

While the FTC lawsuit and AWS performance concerns loom, the majority of analysts remain optimistic about Amazon. The company's stock has remained unchanged over the past year but has experienced a substantial 44% surge this year. This optimism suggests that despite immediate challenges, market watchers still see potential in the e-commerce giant's performance.

Third quarter U.S. GDP in focus

Third quarter came in at a hotter than expected 4.9% for the third quarter from the previous quarter. At the expected 4.3%, it would have been the fastest growth since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

In addition, new of 210,000 last week were slightly higher than the expected 208,000 and up from the prior week. And rose 1.1% in September from the prior month, a turnaround from the decline of 7.1% the month before.

Amazon takes the earnings lead

The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected after the closing bell.

The e-commerce and cloud computing giant is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) met expectations for profit and said it would slow capacity growth in 2024. Shares fell 0.5%. United Parcel Service (NYSE: ) fell slightly below expectations for revenue, and shares were down 4%.

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.

1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up

It was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.

Meta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.

Additionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.

However, Meta’s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company’s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.

Earnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session’s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and slipped by 140 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.

The tech-heavy fell 2.4%, recording its worst day since February, while the broad-based dropped 1.4% and the blue chip fell 0.3%.

The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results due from e-commerce giant Amazon the highlight [see above].

Numbers are also due from the likes of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE: ), carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ), auto giant Ford (NYSE: ) and Mexican fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE: ).

There are a number of economic indicators due Thursday, headlined by the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product [see below].

September , , and retail inventory numbers and weekly will be published at the same time as the GDP report.

3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak

The meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to pause its rate-hiking cycle after raising interest rates at its past 10 meetings.

The central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.

A weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.

However, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB’s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.

""The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.

4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly

The Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter , due out later in the session.

GDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

This expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.

However, the is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.

5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise

Crude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session’s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.

The benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.

U.S. climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world’s largest consumer.

After the wave of enthusiasm for artificial intelligence in the tech sector, earnings reports are showing that some companies are ahead of others. While Alphabet's cloud revenue rose in the quarter, it didn't rise as much as analysts had forecast as the parent of Google continues to build out its AI capabilities to compete with other cloud services providers. At the same time, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s cloud revenue notched a strong showing.

Tech investors have also been beaten down by sharply rising interest rates in recent weeks, with the 10-year Treasury hitting over 5% this week before drifting lower. But Wednesday's selloff in the Nasdaq -- on pace for its worst performance in months -- could bring the dip buyers back in.

Analysts are watching to see what happens at next week's meeting at the Federal Reserve, which is expected to hold interest rates steady when it issues its decision on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell's press conference remarks that afternoon will be closely scrutinized for the Fed's thinking heading into the end of the year. The Fed will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product, due out Thursday, and the September reading on inflation in the form of the personal consumption expenditures index.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Amazon reports

E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion. Analysts will be listening to what it says about the upcoming holiday sales season.

2. Merck (NS: ) earnings

Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Company Inc (NYSE: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.95 on revenue of $15.3 billion.

3. Southwest Air reports

Carrier Southwest Airlines Company (NYSE: ) is expected to report earnings per share of 38 cents on revenue of $6.56 billion, and analysts will be listening to what executives say about travel demand and fuel costs."

New AI capabilities make it easier for sellers to write engaging, effective product listings, and help shoppers find what they are looking for, the company said in a statement.

“At Amazon Ads, we are always thinking about ways we can reduce friction for our advertisers, provide them with tools that deliver more impact while minimizing effort, and ultimately, deliver a better advertising experience for our customers,” said Colleen Aubrey, senior vice president of Amazon Ads Products and Technology.

Amazon Ads has launched image generation in beta — a generative AI solution designed to remove creative barriers and enable brands to produce lifestyle imagery that helps improve their ads’ performance.

This solution is helpful for advertisers of all sizes, said the company. The image generation capability is easy to use and requires no technical expertise.

In the Amazon Ad Console, advertisers simply select their product and click Generate, with the tool leveraging generative AI to deliver a set of lifestyle and brand-themed images, based on product details, in a matter of seconds.

The image can then be refined by entering short text prompts, while multiple versions can be quickly created and tested to optimise performance, said Amazon.

In a March 2022 survey, Amazon had found that among advertisers who were unable to build successful campaigns, nearly 75 per cent cited building ad creatives and choosing a creative format as their biggest challenges.

Despite this setback, Alphabet still surpassed overall earnings and revenue expectations.

Microsoft, on the other hand, witnessed a 3.6% rise in its shares following robust Q1 results across all segments. The company's successful AI investments and strong performance of its cloud business have been identified as key contributors to this positive outcome.

The day also saw other mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) experiencing decreases of 0.8%, 0.5%, and 1.3% respectively due to the rise in long-dated U.S Treasury yields nearing the critical 5% level.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Amazon to Launch AWS European Sovereign Cloud,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-to-launch-aws-european-sovereign-cloud-432SI-3865620,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com company (AMZN), today announced it will launch the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, a new, independent cloud for Europe designed to help public sector customers and those in highly regulated industries meet the most stringent regulatory data residency and operational requirements. Located and operated within Europe, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be physically and logically separate from existing AWS Regions, with the same security, availability, and performance of existing AWS Regions, giving customers additional choice to meet their data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will launch with its first AWS Region in Germany and will be available to all European customers.

As with existing AWS Regions, customers will have the control and assurance that AWS will not access or use customer data for any purpose without their agreement, as well as access to the strongest sovereignty controls among leading cloud providers. Only EU-resident AWS employees who are located in the EU will have control of the operations and support for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. For customers with enhanced data residency needs, the AWS European Sovereign Cloud will allow customers to keep all metadata they create (such as the roles, permissions, resource labels, and configurations they use to run AWS) in the EU, and will feature its own billing and usage metering systems.

“The AWS European Sovereign Cloud reinforces our commitment to offering AWS customers the most advanced set of sovereignty controls, privacy safeguards, and security features available in the cloud,” said Max Peterson, vice president of Sovereign Cloud at AWS. “For more than a decade, we’ve worked with governments and regulatory bodies across Europe to understand and meet evolving needs in cybersecurity, data privacy and localization, and more recently, digital sovereignty. With this new offering, customers and Partners across Europe will have more choice to achieve the operational independence they require, without compromising on the broadest and deepest cloud services that millions of customers already know and use today.”

“The development of a European AWS cloud will make it much easier for many public sector organizations and companies with high data security and data protection requirements to use AWS services,” said Claudia Plattner, president, German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI). “We are aware of the innovative power of modern cloud services, and we want to help make them securely available for Germany and Europe. The C5 (Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue), which was developed by the BSI, has significantly shaped cybersecurity cloud standards, and AWS was, in fact, the first cloud service provider to receive the BSI’s C5 testate. In this respect, we are very pleased to constructively accompany the local development of an AWS cloud, which will also contribute to European sovereignty, in terms of security.”

The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will be sovereign-by-design and will be built on more than a decade of AWS’s experience operating multiple independent clouds for the most critical and restricted workloads. Customers who need more options to address stringent isolation and in-country data residency needs will be able to leverage existing offerings like AWS Outposts or AWS Dedicated Local Zones to deploy AWS European Sovereign Cloud infrastructure in locations they select. AWS Outposts are fully managed solutions that deliver AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a consistent hybrid experience. They are designed for workloads that need to remain on-premises due to latency, data processing, and data residency requirements, where customers want those workloads to run seamlessly with their other workloads in AWS. AWS Dedicated Local Zones are a type of infrastructure built for exclusive use by a customer or community and placed in a customer-specified location. They are designed to reduce the operational overhead of managing on-premises infrastructure at scale, and can be configured to meet a customer’s specific regulatory requirements.

AWS European Sovereign Cloud customers will benefit from the same low latency and high availability they expect from existing AWS Regions, and from access to the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud to drive innovation. The AWS European Sovereign Cloud will offer multiple Availability Zones, infrastructure that is placed in separate and distinct geographic locations, with enough distance to significantly reduce the risk of a single event impacting customers’ business continuity, yet near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security, and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks.

AWS offers the largest and most comprehensive cloud infrastructure globally, with 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, and has plans to launch 15 more Availability Zones and five more AWS Regions in Canada, Germany, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS infrastructure in Europe currently includes eight AWS Regions in Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Milan, Paris, Stockholm, Spain, and Zurich and more than 120 Content Distribution Network (CDN) points of presence in more than 25 cities across 19 European Member States. Some of the largest AWS development teams are located in Europe, with key centers in Dublin, Dresden, and Berlin. Today, Amazon is creating thousands of high-quality jobs and investing billions of euros in European economies. Across the EU, Amazon has created more than 100,000 permanent jobs, and many major components of AWS, including the AWS Nitro System and Amazon CloudWatch, are built in the EU. AWS European Sovereign Cloud will drive economic development through investing in infrastructure, jobs, and skills in communities and countries across Europe. As part of a continued commitment to contribute to the development of digital skills, AWS will hire and develop additional local personnel to operate and support the AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

Customers, AWS Partners, and regulators welcome AWS European Sovereign Cloud

Organizations across the European Union are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. AWS provides the most comprehensive compliance controls, supporting 143 security standards and compliance certifications, to help customers satisfy regulatory requirements around the globe. To meet additional data residency, operational autonomy, and resiliency needs in Europe, AWS is collaborating closely with European regulators and national cybersecurity agencies to build the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Many regulators, customers, and AWS Partners across Europe welcome the new AWS European Sovereign Cloud.

“We welcome the commitment of AWS to expand its infrastructure with an independent European cloud. This will give businesses and public sector organizations more choice in meeting digital sovereignty requirements,” said Dr. Markus Richter, chief information officer of the German federal government. “Cloud services are essential for the digitization of the public administration. With the ‘German Administration Cloud Strategy’ and the ‘EVB-IT Cloud’ contract standard, the foundations for cloud use in the public administration have been established. I am very pleased to work together with AWS to practically and collaboratively implement sovereignty in line with our cloud strategy.”

“The German and European economies are on course for digitization. The strong German ‘Mittelstand’ which are small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular need a sovereign digital infrastructure that meets the highest requirements in order to continue to be competitive in the global market,” said Stefan Schnorr, state secretary at the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport. “For our digital independence, it is important that computing power is generated locally in Germany and that further investments are made in the digitalization of the local economy. We therefore welcome the announcement by AWS to locate the European cloud in Germany.”

“AWS’s announcement of an independent European cloud will provide organizations facing the most stringent regulations with more choice in their digital sovereignty strategy,” said Jarkko Levasma, Finland Government chief information officer at the Ministry of Finance. “In order to successfully provide human-centric and secure services to citizens and businesses, public sector agencies need to have cloud solutions that are compatible with data protection and other legislation.”

“Data sovereignty and residency are now at the forefront of European and national security debates. Therefore, AWS’s announcement of an independent European cloud is indeed the right decision at the right time that will ultimately also bolster transatlantic collaboration,” said Tomas Krejci, deputy director of the National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) in the Czech Republic. “We acknowledge that it will provide more heavily regulated organizations, such as those in the public sector with an eye on evolving regulation, more choice in their digital sovereignty strategy. A totally independent cloud, which delivers appropriate levels of cyber security together with the assurance of meeting stringent data protection requirements, will always benefit both public sector agencies and citizens at large.”

“We welcome the announcement by AWS to further enhance its current European infrastructure footprint with a new independent cloud.

2022-10-24, Investing.com,Amazon mulls offering veterinary telehealth - CNBC,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-mulls-offering-veterinary-telehealth--cnbc-432SI-3864298,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is said to be mulling an expansion into veterinary telehealth, CNBC reported Tuesday, in its latest bid to compete with Walmart (NYSE: ).

The publication said people familiar with the matter informed them of the news. Amazon has already made its move into human health, acquiring One Medical. While the company is a strong player in the pet food market, it has yet to meaningfully invest in pet health.

Walmart began offering veterinary telehealth to Walmart+ subscribers earlier this year. Like human telehealth, veterinary telehealth lets pet owners have virtual appointments with veterinarians and veterinary technicians.

CNBC added that Walmart signed a deal with veterinary telehealth provider Pawp and that Amazon could do the same, with Pawp having already proven it can scale with a large retailer. However, they also said the e-commerce giant could partner with other pet telehealth startups on the market or build its own practice."

The analysts comment ""Our View: Based on intra-quarter data points and our model sensitivity analysis, we view the Street’s Q3 Revenue (+11% Y/Y and +5% Q/Q), Operating Income (implying 5.3% margin) and AWS Revenue (+12.5% Y/Y and 4% Q/Q) estimates as reasonable, given our positive channel checks suggesting Cloud demand acceleration (in H2 and into ’24). As for Q4, we view the Street’s Total Revenue (12% Y/Y, 18% Q/Q) and Operating Income estimates (implying 5.2% margin) as at least bracketable. Overall, we see an attractive risk-reward set-up for Amazon heading into the Q3 print, given very reasonable Street estimates for topline growth and N.A. Retail Op margin assumptions (3% margin for Q3), relatively conservative buyside expectations for AWS growth, and our checks that suggest a recovering/accelerating Cloud spending environment that should persist into ’24 (which we believe the market is not giving AMZN full credit for), and improving fulfillment capacity utilization (i.e. Retail Op Margin expansion). Our Stock Call: We have a Tactical Outperform on AMZN AND it’s our Top Large Cap ‘Net Long. We particularly like the riskreward heading into the Q3 EPS print, given reasonably low expectations.

2022-10-24, IANS,Amazon rolls out passwordless sign-ins for users on iOS and web,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-rolls-out-passwordless-signins-for-users-on-ios-and-web-3863210,"New Delhi, Oct 24 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is rolling out passkey support on browsers and mobile shopping apps (iOS users), making it easier and safer for the customers to access their accounts with passwordless sign-in.Customers can now set up passkeys in their Amazon settings, allowing them to use the same face, fingerprint, or PIN used to unlock their device.

“This is about giving customers ease-of-use and security simultaneously in their Amazon experience,” said Dave Treadwell, senior vice president of ecommerce at Amazon.

“While passwords will still be around in the foreseeable future, this is an exciting step in the right direction. We are thrilled to be an early adopter of this new authentication method, helping to realize our vision for a more secure, passwordless internet,” Treadwell added.

Passkey support is available for all Amazon customers using browsers and is gradually rolling out on the iOS Amazon Shopping app with support coming soon on the Android Amazon Shopping app, the e-commerce giant said in a statement late on Monday.

Unlike passwords, passkeys cannot be written down or guessed, helping to prevent the accidental sharing of a passkey with a hacker.

“When a customer uses a passkey on their device, it proves they have their device and are able to unlock it. Customers no longer need to worry about remembering unique passwords or using easy-to-guess identifiers, like names or birthdays,” said Amazon.

A customer can use passkeys to sign in to apps and sites the same way they unlock their devices -- with a fingerprint, face scan, or lock screen PIN.

Passkeys are also less susceptible to phishing attacks than passwords and one-time codes in text messages, making them a more secure option, said the company.

The companies have added nearly $4tn to their market capitalization in 2022 alone, overshadowing the $3.4tn increase for the entire MSCI index. This significant influence has even affected markets abroad, with the facing a potential decline without their contributions.

Today, US companies account for 61% of the $60tn MSCI index, a considerable rise from less than 50% a decade ago. The ten largest stocks now constitute almost 19% of the index, a substantial increase from 8% in 2013.

However, global stocks have experienced instability over recent months due to concerns about interest rates and geopolitical risks such as the Israel-Hamas conflict. US stocks currently trade at about 18 times their expected earnings over the next year, compared to 12 times for the MSCI all-country excluding US stocks.

In this climate, Max Gokhman from Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions and Jurrien Timmer from Fidelity have both suggested that non-US stocks being cheaper does not necessarily mean they will outperform. They caution that the ""magnificent seven"" could face pressure if they fail to demonstrate tangible benefits from AI growth next year. However, they also suggest that growth stocks could see benefits when interest rates start to decline.

In related news, OpenAI, the group behind ChatGPT, is currently discussing a share sale with investors that would value it at about $86bn, tripling its value since April.

The ongoing dominance of US firms in global markets has sparked concerns about a potential US monopoly. This could potentially drain liquidity from other markets and incentivize companies to relocate their listings for higher valuations and trading volumes in the US.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

Spinozzi from Saco Bank predicts that these yields could rise to between 5.20% and 5.25%.

Reid from Deutsche Bank (ETR: ) expressed concern about how markets might react to these high yields in the U.S., especially considering the potential pain from yield sell-offs in a market influenced by quantitative easing (QE) amidst an enormous global debt load.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower 1.5% after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion, which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview: Testing key support ahead of Big Tech earnings",https://in.investing.com/news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-testing-key-support-ahead-of-big-tech-earnings-432SI-3862277,"At the start of the new trading week, major technology stocks are falling, also driving the U.S. equity futures lower, as the crossed 5% for the first time in 16 years.

The new wave of selling comes after the (SPX) lost as much as 2.4% last week. The index is now testing the key near-term support in the range of 4180-4200. A break of this zone would mark a major bearish development that could take the S&P 500 below 4000 in the coming months.

The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 now stands at 17.7, which is below the 5-year average (18.7) but above the 10-year average (17.5).

The Index (IXIC) lost 3.2% with the tech-heavy index now trading at the lowest levels since May. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) contributed to the downfall with its shares closing over 15% lower in response to the soft Q3 earnings report and cautious comments on the earnings call.

Finally, the (DJI) index fell 1.6% to close below the 100-moving average.

“The bears won the week on a variety of fronts, including geopolitics (where tensions escalated globally), rates (long-end Treasury yields rose further), the trajectory of underlying growth (which seems to be cooler than the headline government statistics would suggest), and earnings (there were plenty of upside earnings reports, most notably NFLX, but the greater number of surprises came on the downside),” analysts at Vital Knowledge said on Friday.

The key economic data piece for this week is the U.S. GDP Q3 print that is out on Thursday.

Big Tech is Here

As of Q3 2022, with 17% of S&P 500 companies having reported actual results, 73% of them have exceeded their earnings per share expectations, and 66% have surpassed revenue expectations, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 is currently experiencing a blended YoY earnings decline of -0.4%.

The earnings calendar for this week is packed. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Visa (NYSE: ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) are all scheduled to report on Tuesday.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), ServiceNow (NYSE: ), and Boeing (NYSE: ) are due to report on Wednesday, while Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Mastercard (NYSE: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) are some of the most important reporters on Thursday. Finally, oil majors Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon (NYSE: ) are scheduled for Friday.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Citi’s analysts: “We remain constructive on the fundamental setup for the S&P 500 headed into 2024. No doubt, a myriad of macro forces provide risk to the outlook. Yet, at the same time, there are several trends unfolding under the surface that deserve attention.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Last October, USD peak coincided with the equity trough, and the more mixed equity performance in the past few months is coinciding with USD bottoming. Almost always in the past, when USD is strengthening, global equities have been under pressure.”

RBC’s analysts: “October can be a tough month for stocks, but more often than not tends to see the S&P 500 rise. Unfortunately, as of mid October of 2022, US equities are still in a spooky place.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “While there are plenty of events and fundamental data points worth considering, we find many remain fixated on the Fed's next move and S&P 500 price. These factors appear to be dictating narratives and positioning. On that score, last week brought further risks to the consensus 4Q rally view.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “2007. Amid higher rates, we expect investors will continue to focus on balance sheet strength and avoid companies that are most vulnerable to increased borrow costs. Performance since the start of September has reflected this dynamic as strong balance sheet stocks outperformed weak balance sheet stocks by 4 pp. For companies with strong balance sheets, we expect investors will reward those firms returning cash to shareholders and will remain skeptical of companies making large capex investments at this stage of the cycle.”"
2022-10-23, Investing.com,Dow futures slump as yields soar; major tech earnings in focus,https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-slump-as-yields-soar-major-tech-earnings-in-focus-3862012,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures weakened Monday, weighed by soaring bond yields and as investors warily awaited the release of quarterly earnings from a number of the major tech giants.

By 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), the contract was down 180 points, or 0.5%, traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower and dropped 90 points, or 0.6%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indices on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially hitting supply in the important region."
2022-10-23, Investing.com,US Treasury yield near 5% amid tech earnings and global economic data,https://in.investing.com/news/us-treasury-yield-near-5-amid-tech-earnings-and-global-economic-data-93CH-3861219,"The previous week saw the 10-year US Treasury yield nearing a significant 5%, which led to a decline in stocks due to its record correlation with the . The current scenario suggests that both stocks and bond prices are falling in unison, driven by concerns over prolonged interest rates and term premium. This comes as investors consider factors such as the long-term inflation outlook, bond supply, and government spending plans.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

2022-10-20, IANS,E-com platforms log Rs 47K cr worth GMV in 1st week of India festive sales,https://in.investing.com/news/ecom-platforms-log-rs-47k-cr-worth-gmv-in-1st-week-of-india-festive-sales-3859672,"Bengaluru, Oct 20 (IANS) E-commerce platforms in India clocked a gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 47,000 crore in the first week of the festive sale season, growing at 19 per cent from the same period last year, a new report showed on Friday. High average selling price (ASP) items such as mobiles, electronics and large appliances emerged as the largest contributor to the sales, driving 67 per cent of the total sales, according to the report from market research firm Redseer Strategy Consultants.

Trends suggest that low ASP categories like fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC) and home will continue to grow in the remaining festive season, the report added.

Flipkart Group continued to assert its leadership in the week 1 of the festive season sale, further gaining market share over last year’s sale to reach 63 per cent in GMV terms. In volume terms, Meesho retained its second position, notably gaining market share to reach 25 per cent of the total orders, up from 21 per cent in 2022.

""While the Indian consumers are holding back discretionary spends, they are willing to spend it they get the desired value or deals,"" said Abhishek Tandon, engagement manager, Redseer.

Eight out of the nine days of the sale period this year were in the ‘shradh’ period, compared to four out of the nine days in 2022.

""This led consumers to over-index purchases towards 'essential upgrades' in this festive season, and to prioritise buying/upgrading high ASP categories such as mobiles, electronics and large appliances, which typically have time-bound deals with easy financing options,"" the findings showed.

The last day of the week 1 sale, the only ‘non-shradh’ day, saw a 36 per cent YoY growth compared to the last day of week 1 in 2022.

Further, 30 per cent of the consumers who shopped high ASP categories in Week 1, utilised easily accessible financing options while making these purchases, said the report. About 55 per cent of the consumers who shopped during Week 1 are planning to make more purchases in the remaining festive season, with more than 50 per cent planning to make these purchases in fashion and over 25 per cent of these consumers planning to purchase other low ASP categories like BPC and home and living.

E-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Flipkart, Myntra and others began the festive season sales from October 7 which is expected to reach Rs 90,000 crore worth online GMV in the festive month -- up 18-20 per cent from last year’s festive month sales.

The illegal call centres impacted over 2,000 Amazon and Microsoft customers primarily based in the US, but also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and the UK.

2022-10-20, IANS,"Bezos-backed trucking startup Convoy shuts down core biz, lays off hundreds",https://in.investing.com/news/bezosbacked-trucking-startup-convoy-shuts-down-core-biz-lays-off-hundreds-3858645,"San Francisco, Oct 20 (IANS) US-based digital transportation startup Convoy has abruptly shut down its core business, laying off a majority of its workforce, and sacked employees reportedly did not receive severance.Convoy CEO Dan Lewis wrote in a memo sent to employees that “we hoped this day would never come”, reports GeekWire.

“We spent over 4 months exhausting all viable strategic options for the business. However, none of the options ultimately materialized into anything sufficient to keep the company going in its then current form,” he told employees late on Thursday.

Sending shockwaves through the global tech ecosystem, Lewis said the company faced both an “unprecedented freight market collapse” and “dramatic monetary tightening”.

“This combination ultimately crushed our progress at the same time that it was crushing our logical strategic acquirer -- it was the perfect storm,” he wrote in the memo.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos-backed Convoy had around 500 employees before the announcement to shut down core operations.

The company raised $260 million at a $3.8 billion valuation nearly 18 months ago, according to the report.

Lewis said that Convoy will be closing down its current core business operations.

“Some of our team will continue on to handle this windup transition and potential future strategic options (all whom have already been spoken with), today is your last day at the company,” he told employees.

He said that they are in the middle of a massive freight recession and a contraction in the capital markets.

“Convoy’s tech centric approach to trucking created real benefits. It also created the conditions for a truly scalable technology platform and business model that would have yielded real financial gains when market conditions improve. But in the end, market forces were too strong for us to withstand on our own,” said the CEO.

“M&A activity has shrunk substantially and most of the logical strategic acquirers of Convoy are also suffering from the freight market collapse, making the deal doing that much harder,” noted Lewis, who formerly led new shopping experiences at Amazon.

The announcement came just a week after supply chain software startup Flexport said it will lay off about 20 per cent of its workforce.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

Trading volumes on the increased, while those on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) decreased.

The bond market sell-off raised credit concerns and heightened tensions between Israel and Hamas escalated market risks. Despite these factors, oil prices dropped to $87.61 per barrel.

In corporate news, Chevron (NYSE: )'s decision to acquire Hess (NYSE: ) for $53 billion resulted in a 3% fall in Chevron's stock, while Hess shares remained stable. Meanwhile, Roche Holding (OTC: ) announced its acquisition of Telavant for $7.1 billion.

Looking ahead, investors are anticipating the upcoming earnings reports from the 'Magnificent 7' megacaps including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

The U.S. Treasury yields retreated with the 10-year yield at 4.91%, the 30-year yield at 5.04%, and the 2-year yield at 5.10%. The high yields, which reached a psychological level of 5%, were linked to uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policies according to Donovan from UBS. Spinozzi from Saco Bank predicts that these yields could rise to between 5.20% and 5.25%.

Reid from Deutsche Bank (ETR: ) expressed concern about how markets might react to these high yields in the U.S., especially considering the potential pain from yield sell-offs in a market influenced by quantitative easing (QE) amidst an enormous global debt load.

Furthermore, political developments have also added to market risks. The U.S. House's lack of a speaker raises the risk of a government shutdown after Halloween, increasing the risk premium around such an event. The mix of quantitative tightening (QT) and strong government supply was also underscored as a significant factor.

At 09:41 ET (13:41 GMT), the was down 200 points or 0.6%, while the was down 0.7% and the was down 0.9%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indexes on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based S&P dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Chevron set to buy Hess for $53 billion

Elsewhere, the oil market is once more the center of major M&A, as Chevron (NYSE: ) announced plans to buy smaller rival Hess (NYSE: ) in a $53-billion all-stock deal, implying a premium of about 4.9% to the share's last close. Chevron shares fell 2.7%, while Hess shares rose 0.6%.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower 1.5% after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion, which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict.

The new wave of selling comes after the (SPX) lost as much as 2.4% last week. The index is now testing the key near-term support in the range of 4180-4200. A break of this zone would mark a major bearish development that could take the S&P 500 below 4000 in the coming months.

The forward 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 now stands at 17.7, which is below the 5-year average (18.7) but above the 10-year average (17.5).

The Index (IXIC) lost 3.2% with the tech-heavy index now trading at the lowest levels since May. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) contributed to the downfall with its shares closing over 15% lower in response to the soft Q3 earnings report and cautious comments on the earnings call.

Finally, the (DJI) index fell 1.6% to close below the 100-moving average.

“The bears won the week on a variety of fronts, including geopolitics (where tensions escalated globally), rates (long-end Treasury yields rose further), the trajectory of underlying growth (which seems to be cooler than the headline government statistics would suggest), and earnings (there were plenty of upside earnings reports, most notably NFLX, but the greater number of surprises came on the downside),” analysts at Vital Knowledge said on Friday.

The key economic data piece for this week is the U.S. GDP Q3 print that is out on Thursday.

Big Tech is Here

As of Q3 2022, with 17% of S&P 500 companies having reported actual results, 73% of them have exceeded their earnings per share expectations, and 66% have surpassed revenue expectations, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 is currently experiencing a blended YoY earnings decline of -0.4%.

The earnings calendar for this week is packed. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Visa (NYSE: ), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) are all scheduled to report on Tuesday.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), ServiceNow (NYSE: ), and Boeing (NYSE: ) are due to report on Wednesday, while Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Mastercard (NYSE: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) are some of the most important reporters on Thursday. Finally, oil majors Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon (NYSE: ) are scheduled for Friday.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Citi’s analysts: “We remain constructive on the fundamental setup for the S&P 500 headed into 2024. No doubt, a myriad of macro forces provide risk to the outlook. Yet, at the same time, there are several trends unfolding under the surface that deserve attention.”

JPMorgan’s analysts: “Last October, USD peak coincided with the equity trough, and the more mixed equity performance in the past few months is coinciding with USD bottoming. Almost always in the past, when USD is strengthening, global equities have been under pressure.”

RBC’s analysts: “October can be a tough month for stocks, but more often than not tends to see the S&P 500 rise. Unfortunately, as of mid October of 2022, US equities are still in a spooky place.”

Morgan Stanley’s analysts: “While there are plenty of events and fundamental data points worth considering, we find many remain fixated on the Fed's next move and S&P 500 price. These factors appear to be dictating narratives and positioning. On that score, last week brought further risks to the consensus 4Q rally view.”

Goldman Sachs’ analysts: “2007. Amid higher rates, we expect investors will continue to focus on balance sheet strength and avoid companies that are most vulnerable to increased borrow costs. Performance since the start of September has reflected this dynamic as strong balance sheet stocks outperformed weak balance sheet stocks by 4 pp. For companies with strong balance sheets, we expect investors will reward those firms returning cash to shareholders and will remain skeptical of companies making large capex investments at this stage of the cycle.”"

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,US Treasury yield near 5% amid tech earnings and global economic data,https://in.investing.com/news/us-treasury-yield-near-5-amid-tech-earnings-and-global-economic-data-93CH-3861219,"The previous week saw the 10-year US Treasury yield nearing a significant 5%, which led to a decline in stocks due to its record correlation with the . The current scenario suggests that both stocks and bond prices are falling in unison, driven by concerns over prolonged interest rates and term premium. This comes as investors consider factors such as the long-term inflation outlook, bond supply, and government spending plans.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

2022-10-22, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3860952,"Investing.com -- The risk-off mood dominating markets looks likely to continue in the coming week, while four out of seven megacap companies are due to report earnings. U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

This aligns with an InvestingPro Tip that suggests Amazon's net income is expected to grow this year.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) predicts an AI-driven boost to Amazon's cloud services as it expands further into the healthcare sector. This expansion follows Amazon's acquisition of PillPack in 2018 and the subsequent launch of Amazon Clinic. The choice of Amazon's pharmacy over CVS Caremark by Blue Shield of California underscores the company's success in this new venture.

Amazon is also making significant strides in the AI market with the launch of Amazon Bedrock and a $4 billion investment in Anthropic. This move positions the company to maintain its AI leadership amidst ongoing legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny. It's worth noting that Amazon is a prominent player in the Broadline Retail industry, as pointed out by InvestingPro Tips.

Chris MacDonald views AMZN stock as offering potential long-term market-beating returns, reflecting a positive outlook on Amazon's future performance. The InvestingPro data further supports this positive outlook, showing a year-to-date price total return of 49.01%.

High average selling price (ASP) items such as mobiles, electronics and large appliances emerged as the largest contributor to the sales, driving 67 per cent of the total sales, according to the report from market research firm Redseer Strategy Consultants.

Trends suggest that low ASP categories like fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC) and home will continue to grow in the remaining festive season, the report added.

Flipkart Group continued to assert its leadership in the week 1 of the festive season sale, further gaining market share over last year’s sale to reach 63 per cent in GMV terms. In volume terms, Meesho retained its second position, notably gaining market share to reach 25 per cent of the total orders, up from 21 per cent in 2022.

""While the Indian consumers are holding back discretionary spends, they are willing to spend it they get the desired value or deals,"" said Abhishek Tandon, engagement manager, Redseer.

Eight out of the nine days of the sale period this year were in the ‘shradh’ period, compared to four out of the nine days in 2022.

""This led consumers to over-index purchases towards 'essential upgrades' in this festive season, and to prioritise buying/upgrading high ASP categories such as mobiles, electronics and large appliances, which typically have time-bound deals with easy financing options,"" the findings showed.

The last day of the week 1 sale, the only ‘non-shradh’ day, saw a 36 per cent YoY growth compared to the last day of week 1 in 2022.

Further, 30 per cent of the consumers who shopped high ASP categories in Week 1, utilised easily accessible financing options while making these purchases, said the report. About 55 per cent of the consumers who shopped during Week 1 are planning to make more purchases in the remaining festive season, with more than 50 per cent planning to make these purchases in fashion and over 25 per cent of these consumers planning to purchase other low ASP categories like BPC and home and living.

E-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Flipkart, Myntra and others began the festive season sales from October 7 which is expected to reach Rs 90,000 crore worth online GMV in the festive month -- up 18-20 per cent from last year’s festive month sales.

 in India",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-microsoft-team-up-to-protect-users-from-impersonation-scams-in-india-3859135,"New Delhi, Oct 20 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Friday announced that it has teamed up with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) to protect consumers from impersonation scams in India.On Thursday, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI (NS: )) announced it conducted multiple criminal raids in various cities spanning several states against illegal call centres in India that were set up to impersonate Microsoft and Amazon customer support.

The illegal call centres impacted over 2,000 Amazon and Microsoft customers primarily based in the US, but also in Australia, Canada, Germany, Spain, and the UK.

This operation was supported by a joint criminal referral made by Amazon and Microsoft through joint prosecution agreements in the US and India, as the same cyber criminals were targeting both the company's customers.

“We are pleased to join forces with Microsoft, and we believe actionable partnerships like these are critical in helping protect consumers from impersonation scams,” Kathy Sheehan, vice president and associate general counsel, Business Conduct & Ethics, said in a statement.

Together, the companies are setting a precedent for the power of industry collaboration and the collective impact it can have in holding bad actors accountable.

""We will continue to work with Indian law enforcement agencies as well as authorities from countries of victims so that they can continue to act,"" the company said.

Moreover, the company mentioned that it had initiated takedowns of more than 20,000 phishing websites and 10,000 phone numbers being used as part of impersonation schemes in 2022.

2022-10-20, IANS,"Bezos-backed trucking startup Convoy shuts down core biz, lays off hundreds",https://in.investing.com/news/bezosbacked-trucking-startup-convoy-shuts-down-core-biz-lays-off-hundreds-3858645,"San Francisco, Oct 20 (IANS) US-based digital transportation startup Convoy has abruptly shut down its core business, laying off a majority of its workforce, and sacked employees reportedly did not receive severance.Convoy CEO Dan Lewis wrote in a memo sent to employees that “we hoped this day would never come”, reports GeekWire.

“We spent over 4 months exhausting all viable strategic options for the business. However, none of the options ultimately materialized into anything sufficient to keep the company going in its then current form,” he told employees late on Thursday.

Sending shockwaves through the global tech ecosystem, Lewis said the company faced both an “unprecedented freight market collapse” and “dramatic monetary tightening”.

“This combination ultimately crushed our progress at the same time that it was crushing our logical strategic acquirer -- it was the perfect storm,” he wrote in the memo.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos-backed Convoy had around 500 employees before the announcement to shut down core operations.

The company raised $260 million at a $3.8 billion valuation nearly 18 months ago, according to the report.

Lewis said that Convoy will be closing down its current core business operations.

“Some of our team will continue on to handle this windup transition and potential future strategic options (all whom have already been spoken with), today is your last day at the company,” he told employees.

He said that they are in the middle of a massive freight recession and a contraction in the capital markets.

“Convoy’s tech centric approach to trucking created real benefits. It also created the conditions for a truly scalable technology platform and business model that would have yielded real financial gains when market conditions improve. But in the end, market forces were too strong for us to withstand on our own,” said the CEO.

“M&A activity has shrunk substantially and most of the logical strategic acquirers of Convoy are also suffering from the freight market collapse, making the deal doing that much harder,” noted Lewis, who formerly led new shopping experiences at Amazon.

The announcement came just a week after supply chain software startup Flexport said it will lay off about 20 per cent of its workforce.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

The ETF carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.25%, lower than two of the largest funds in its category: the $8.1 billion iShares Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (CNDX) and the £4.1 billion Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF (EQQQ). This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking cost-effective exposure to the high-performing tech sector.

Nasdaq ETFs have gained popularity among investors for their broad coverage of over 3,000 stocks within the Index, predominantly technology and growth companies. This wide coverage allows investors to pursue diverse investment strategies without having to buy each stock separately. Other key benefits include high liquidity from trading on platforms like the New York Stock Exchange and lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds due to their passive management approach.

The focus on the technology sector by these ETFs provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the sector's growth. Industry leaders such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google) significantly contribute to the performance of these indices.

ETFs offer a route for investors to gain exposure to the innovative, tech-dominant Nasdaq exchange and potential high returns.

""We’re working hard at Amazon to dramatically narrow the golden window from diagnosis to treatment, and drone delivery marks a significant step forward,"" said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy.

The drones fly at an altitude of 40 to 120 meters, and their built-in sense-and-avoid technology uses sensors and cameras to navigate around objects.

Once they arrive at the customer’s home, the drone lowers itself above a delivery marker, and when the delivery zone is clear, it will release the package. The Amazon Pharmacy customers do not have any interaction with the drone.

With today's news, IBM Consulting plans to train and skill 10,000 consultants on AWS generative AI services by end of 2024. They will have access to an exclusive, partner-only program that provides training on the top use cases and best practices for client engagement with AWS generative AI services. This will help advance their knowledge, allow them to engage with technical professionals and better serve clients innovating on AWS.

""Enterprise clients are looking for expert help to build a strategy and develop generative AI use cases that can drive business value and transformation – while mitigating risks,"" said Manish Goyal , Senior Partner, Global AI & Analytics Leader at IBM Consulting. ""Paired with IBM's AI heritage and deep expertise in business transformation on AWS, this suite of reengineered solutions with embedded generative AI capabilities can help our mutual clients to scale generative AI applications rapidly and responsibly on their platform of choice.""

IBM is also responding to client demand for generative AI capabilities on AWS by making watsonx.data , a fit-for-purpose data store built on an open lakehouse architecture, available on AWS as a fully managed software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution– which clients can also access in AWS Marketplace . The company also plans to make watsonx.ai and watsonx.governance available on AWS by 2024. This builds on previous commitments made by the two companies to make it easier for clients to consume IBM data, AI and security software on AWS.

""Our customers are increasingly looking for the technical support and AI expertise they need to build and implement a generative AI strategy that drives business value from their entire cloud value chain,"" said Chris Niederman , Managing Director, Global Systems Integrators at AWS. ""We are excited to be working with IBM to include embedded generative AI capabilities that assist our mutual customers scale their applications – and help IBM consultants deepen their expertise on best practices for customer engagement with AWS generative AI services.""

Generative AI at scale for telecommunications

Clients are already benefitting from the longstanding relationship between IBM and AWS. Bouygues Telecom, a leading French communications service provider with a history of industry-leading innovation, engaged IBM Consulting to support the company's evolving cloud strategy to explore, design and implement AI use cases at scale while giving teams flexibility to select cloud and AI providers based on departmental and application needs.

Leveraging the IBM Garage approach, the team co-designed a custom data and AI reference architecture covering multiple cloud scenarios that can extend to all AI and data projects across Bouygues Telecom's cloud and on-premises platforms.

""As we sought to leverage generative AI to extract insights from our engagements with clients, we were confronted with some unfamiliar issues around storage, memory size and power requirements,"" said Matthieu Dupuis , Head of AI for Bouygues Telecom. ""IBM Consulting and AWS have been invaluable partners in identifying the right model for our needs and overcoming these technological barriers.""

With the new AI platform on AWS, IBM Consulting enabled Bouygues Telecom to develop proof-of-concept models and scale them into production quickly while helping to minimize costs and risks. The platform also enables their data scientists to work with greater efficiency, purpose, and satisfaction by allowing them to spend more time on complex, high-value AI projects rather than launching standalone solutions.

An evolving relationship

With over 40 years of combined experience on AI solutions, IBM and AWS have been working together to respond to clients who are looking to leverage AI for cost, efficiency, and growth, whether they are looking for a demonstration of the technology, defining potential use cases or full co-creation of bespoke solutions.

Additionally, IBM is an AWS Premier Tier Services Partner with over 22,000 AWS certifications globally and has achieved 17 AWS Service Delivery and 16 AWS Competency designations. Today's news builds on this longstanding relationship and a shared value of the importance of enterprise AI. Getting to enterprise AI at scale requires a human-centric, principled approach, and IBM Consulting helps clients establish guardrails that align with the organization's values and standards, mitigate bias and manage data security, lineage, and provenance.

IBM Consulting accelerates business transformation for our clients through hybrid cloud and AI technologies, leveraging our open ecosystem of partners. With deep industry expertise spanning strategy, experience design, technology, and operations, we have become the trusted partner to many of the world's most innovative and valuable companies, helping modernize and secure their most complex systems. Our 160,000 consultants embrace an open way of working and apply our proven co-creation method, IBM Garage, to scale ideas into outcomes.

In a move that aims to ""reduce delivery times and help identify inventory more quickly,"" the company is making changes to the way products are sorted at fulfillment facilities by introducing ""AI-equipped sortation machines and robotic arms.""

The new robotic system, named Sequoia, ""is designed for both speed and safety,"" and has so far been launched in one of the company's Houston, TX warehouses. Amazon claims it reduces ""the time it takes to fulfill an order by up to 25%,"" and ""can identify and store inventory up to 75% faster.""

The company declined to comment on potential effects on its warehouse headcount, noting that ""it doesn’t see automation and robotics as vehicles for eliminating jobs,"" and added that Sequoia is meant to work alongside warehouse employees ""in a way that should reduce injuries.""

Amazon is one of many companies pursing advancements in AI and robotics to enhance its fulfillment operations - Walmart (NYSE: ), one of AMZN's key rivals, also recently announced introduction of robotic arms in its warehouses.

""It is the worst drought in Manaus,"" said a spokesperson for the port in the capital of Amazonas state.

Hundreds of boats were stranded on the river's sandbanks as a drought has put more than 50 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon region under emergency conditions, reported local media.

October is one of the periods when the waters recede in the Amazon river basin, so the government has launched an operation to dredge the watercourses to allow navigation and avoid water shortages in riverside cities.

""The Rio Negro will go down a little more. From historical data, major droughts last until the end of October to the beginning of November,"" said Renato Senna, climatologist and researcher at the country's National Institute for Space Research.

The analysts comment ""Initiating coverage with a Buy rating and $173 target price. No other e-commerce platform comes close to matching the scale that Amazon has amassed. The company has the broadest selection of items that mirror overall retail sales, in many cases at the lowest prices, the broadest fulfillment network, and the most 3P seller resources available. While scale matters for its core retail business, it is also the foundation upon which its related businesses have been built (Prime, Advertising, etc.) in addition to the many tangential operations that contribute to the overall business today (AWS, subscriptions, hardware, etc.), as well as those that may reach greater scale in the future (Amazon Business, healthcare, and others). In the near-to-medium-term, we see (1) stabilization in cloud spending trends that should benefit AWS (we saw evidence of this in 2Q23), (2) upside to operating margins as the company looks to continue optimization of the massive increase of its fulfillment footprint during COVID (management believes it can get back to pre-COVID margins or better), and (3) continued growth in advertising as the company is set to launch ads in Prime Video in 2024."""
2022-10-16, Investing.com,Amazon’s Potential Embrace of Bitcoin Stirs Market Speculation,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-potential-embrace-of-bitcoin-stirs-market-speculation-93CH-3852594,"Speculation is mounting over the potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies such as by major retailers, with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) at the forefront of discussions. Despite smaller businesses beginning to accept Bitcoin, larger corporations including Amazon have remained hesitant due to concerns over crypto volatility, regulatory complexities, and gaps in consumer understanding.

The online retail giant stands to benefit from potential advantages such as increased customer convenience, attracting a crypto-friendly customer base, and enhancing the speed and cost-efficiency of international transactions. However, Amazon also faces challenges including Bitcoin's scalability issues, which could prove problematic given the retailer's high transaction volume. Other concerns include the volatile value of Bitcoin leading to accounting difficulties and the need for compliance with evolving global cryptocurrency regulations.

Nonetheless, Amazon's ongoing interest in blockchain technology, evidenced by its blockchain patents and services based on this technology, suggests a possible future acceptance of Bitcoin. As of Monday, there has been no official confirmation from Amazon regarding their position on accepting Bitcoin.

In related news, Apple (NASDAQ: ) does not currently accept Bitcoin directly for its products such as iPhones or MacBooks. Yet, in response to the growing influence of cryptocurrencies, the tech giant introduced ""CryptoKit"" in 2019. This tool assists developers in performing cryptographic operations for easier integration of cryptocurrencies into applications.

Apple's App Store guidelines permit apps like digital wallets and exchanges to transmit ""approved virtual currencies,"" provided they comply with laws and don't facilitate illegal activities or violate user privacy. However, these apps are prohibited from mining cryptocurrencies using an iPhone's resources to prevent potential damage.

Bitcoin's evolution into a valuable asset through platforms like Immediate Revolution has significantly impacted the global economy. This decentralized deflationary currency disrupts traditional financial norms and provides solutions for systemic issues. As a store of value or ""Digital ,"" Bitcoin represents change and innovation due to its finite supply and rising demand. It also facilitates efficient cross-border transactions. However, its future, referred to as Silicon’s Golden Child, is a blend of excitement and uncertainty due to rapid growth, price volatility, and regulatory challenges. Despite these risks, potential benefits such as providing financial autonomy to the unbanked population often outweigh the uncertainties. The underlying blockchain technology, the emergence of altcoins, and the avalanche of innovations it has triggered hold immense potential beyond finance.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,Netflix shifts focus amid competitive landscape and revenue growth concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-shifts-focus-amid-competitive-landscape-and-revenue-growth-concerns-93CH-3852540,"In the face of stiff competition from Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Warner Bros., Comcast (NASDAQ: ), and Paramount Global, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is changing its strategy from subscriber growth to earnings maximization. This shift comes as the company implements post-Hollywood actors strike price hikes, launches an ad-supported service, and cracks down on shared accounts.

Netflix, a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, as pointed out by InvestingPro Tips, has been operating with a moderate level of debt. The company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, indicating its financial stability. However, the company's stock has taken a significant hit over the last week, as reflected in InvestingPro's real-time metrics, with a 1-week price total return of -7.84%.

The move follows the recent discontinuation of Netflix's DVD-rental service. Despite a surprising increase of 5.9 million subscribers in July, the company's third-quarter revenue guidance of $8.52 billion fell short of the expected $8.66 billion. In response to this lower than anticipated guidance, Jefferies analysts reduced their price target on Netflix shares.

Barclays (LON: ) analysts voiced concerns about weak revenue growth expectations for Netflix. Meanwhile, Needham predicts that linear TV will regain subscribers in the next 2-3 years.

Netflix shares have seen a significant increase this year, climbing 21% with an average price target of $459.47. This rise comes amidst Amazon's plan to raise streaming prices and Disney considering asset sales. Analysts' recommendations for Netflix shares are mixed: Wedbush analysts are bullish on Netflix, while Cowen analysts expect 6.5 million new paid subscribers with a mix of 23 buy, 20 hold, and two sell recommendations among analysts.

Amazon, another significant player in the industry, has seen a revenue growth acceleration, as per InvestingPro Tips. The company's net income is expected to grow this year, and it operates with a moderate level of debt. However, Amazon's stock has seen a 1-month price total return of -7.55%, according to InvestingPro's real-time metrics.

The InvestingPro platform offers additional tips and real-time metrics for both Netflix and Amazon, providing valuable insights to investors. For more information, visit the InvestingPro's pro/pricing page.

2022-10-15, IANS,Palestine's tech & startup industry bleeding amid Israel-Hamas war,https://in.investing.com/news/palestines-tech--startup-industry-bleeding-amid-israelhamas-war-3850577,"Jerusalem, Oct 15 (IANS) The Israel-Hamas war has blown apart Palestine's growing tech and startup industry that has seen several top-notch companies emerging from Gaza despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world.Those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has recently been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem, reports TechCrunch.

In 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff had backed the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.

Alphabet-backed initiative ‘Gaza Sky Geeks’ provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine’s Gazan population.

In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the programme.

Ibtikar, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, recently raised its second fund of $30 million.

High-growth companies emerging from Palestine include Menalytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat 6 labs); Olivery (last mile logistics, Flat6Labs and Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and Sellenvo (an Amazon (NASDAQ: ) fulfillment partner).

Iliana Montauk, co-founder and CEO of social impact startup Manara, funded by Y Combinator and others, was quoted as saying that Gaza has been bombed many times before but “this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons”.

“Electricity was cut off to the entire Gaza strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighbourhoods are being destroyed,” she told TechCrunch.

“The tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,” she added.

Manara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley in the US and Europe.

Most people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones.

Mohammad Alnobani, founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools, was quoted as saying that “dealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.”

Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it has been completing preparations for a ""significant ground operation"" in the Gaza Strip.

Tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers were being deployed at the border of Gaza in anticipation of a large ground operation, reports said on Sunday.

According to health authorities in Gaza, more than 1,900 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 7,700 wounded by Israeli airstrikes.

Israel said more than 1,300 people were killed during rocket attacks and deadly raids into territory by fighters from Hamas.

This new offering aims to replicate the , which comprises leading non-financial US tech firms. The index has seen a return of 39.2% this year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 14.3%.

The launch of D6RH comes after a ""special rebalance"" of the Nasdaq 100 index due to a breach of weighting restrictions by seven major tech giants. The ETF carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.25%, lower than two of the largest funds in its category: the $8.1 billion iShares Nasdaq 100 UCITS ETF (CNDX) and the £4.1 billion Invesco EQQQ Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF (EQQQ). This makes it an attractive option for investors seeking cost-effective exposure to the high-performing tech sector.

Nasdaq ETFs have gained popularity among investors for their broad coverage of over 3,000 stocks within the Index, predominantly technology and growth companies. This wide coverage allows investors to pursue diverse investment strategies without having to buy each stock separately. Other key benefits include high liquidity from trading on platforms like the New York Stock Exchange and lower expense ratios compared to actively managed mutual funds due to their passive management approach.

The focus on the technology sector by these ETFs provides investors with an opportunity to participate in the sector's growth. Industry leaders such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google) significantly contribute to the performance of these indices.

ETFs offer a route for investors to gain exposure to the innovative, tech-dominant Nasdaq exchange and potential high returns. For instance, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) mirrors the Nasdaq-100 Index's portfolio of the largest non-financial companies from sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, and communication services.

The tech powerhouse, which has been pushing into the healthcare industry, said Amazon Pharmacy customers in the area can get their medications delivered in 60 minutes or less via the drone method.

The medication can be dropped outside customers' doors via the drone delivery service at no additional cost, with pharmacists ensuring medications are loaded and transported to a customer's home within an hour of the order.

""We’re working hard at Amazon to dramatically narrow the golden window from diagnosis to treatment, and drone delivery marks a significant step forward,"" said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy.

The drones fly at an altitude of 40 to 120 meters, and their built-in sense-and-avoid technology uses sensors and cameras to navigate around objects.

Once they arrive at the customer’s home, the drone lowers itself above a delivery marker, and when the delivery zone is clear, it will release the package. The Amazon Pharmacy customers do not have any interaction with the drone.

“Our drones fly over traffic, eliminating the excess time a customer’s package might spend in transit on the road,” said Calsee Hendrickson, director of product and program management at Prime Air."

Generative AI at scale for telecommunications

Clients are already benefitting from the longstanding relationship between IBM and AWS. Bouygues Telecom, a leading French communications service provider with a history of industry-leading innovation, engaged IBM Consulting to support the company's evolving cloud strategy to explore, design and implement AI use cases at scale while giving teams flexibility to select cloud and AI providers based on departmental and application needs.

Leveraging the IBM Garage approach, the team co-designed a custom data and AI reference architecture covering multiple cloud scenarios that can extend to all AI and data projects across Bouygues Telecom's cloud and on-premises platforms.

""As we sought to leverage generative AI to extract insights from our engagements with clients, we were confronted with some unfamiliar issues around storage, memory size and power requirements,"" said Matthieu Dupuis , Head of AI for Bouygues Telecom. ""IBM Consulting and AWS have been invaluable partners in identifying the right model for our needs and overcoming these technological barriers.""

With the new AI platform on AWS, IBM Consulting enabled Bouygues Telecom to develop proof-of-concept models and scale them into production quickly while helping to minimize costs and risks. The platform also enables their data scientists to work with greater efficiency, purpose, and satisfaction by allowing them to spend more time on complex, high-value AI projects rather than launching standalone solutions.

An evolving relationship

With over 40 years of combined experience on AI solutions, IBM and AWS have been working together to respond to clients who are looking to leverage AI for cost, efficiency, and growth, whether they are looking for a demonstration of the technology, defining potential use cases or full co-creation of bespoke solutions.

Additionally, IBM is an AWS Premier Tier Services Partner with over 22,000 AWS certifications globally and has achieved 17 AWS Service Delivery and 16 AWS Competency designations. Today's news builds on this longstanding relationship and a shared value of the importance of enterprise AI. Getting to enterprise AI at scale requires a human-centric, principled approach, and IBM Consulting helps clients establish guardrails that align with the organization's values and standards, mitigate bias and manage data security, lineage, and provenance.

IBM Consulting accelerates business transformation for our clients through hybrid cloud and AI technologies, leveraging our open ecosystem of partners. With deep industry expertise spanning strategy, experience design, technology, and operations, we have become the trusted partner to many of the world's most innovative and valuable companies, helping modernize and secure their most complex systems. Our 160,000 consultants embrace an open way of working and apply our proven co-creation method, IBM Garage, to scale ideas into outcomes.

In a move that aims to ""reduce delivery times and help identify inventory more quickly,"" the company is making changes to the way products are sorted at fulfillment facilities by introducing ""AI-equipped sortation machines and robotic arms.""

The new robotic system, named Sequoia, ""is designed for both speed and safety,"" and has so far been launched in one of the company's Houston, TX warehouses. Amazon claims it reduces ""the time it takes to fulfill an order by up to 25%,"" and ""can identify and store inventory up to 75% faster.""

The company declined to comment on potential effects on its warehouse headcount, noting that ""it doesn’t see automation and robotics as vehicles for eliminating jobs,"" and added that Sequoia is meant to work alongside warehouse employees ""in a way that should reduce injuries.""

Amazon is one of many companies pursing advancements in AI and robotics to enhance its fulfillment operations - Walmart (NYSE: ), one of AMZN's key rivals, also recently announced introduction of robotic arms in its warehouses.

""It is the worst drought in Manaus,"" said a spokesperson for the port in the capital of Amazonas state.

Hundreds of boats were stranded on the river's sandbanks as a drought has put more than 50 municipalities in the Brazilian Amazon region under emergency conditions, reported local media.

October is one of the periods when the waters recede in the Amazon river basin, so the government has launched an operation to dredge the watercourses to allow navigation and avoid water shortages in riverside cities.

""The Rio Negro will go down a little more. From historical data, major droughts last until the end of October to the beginning of November,"" said Renato Senna, climatologist and researcher at the country's National Institute for Space Research.

Stifel analysts initiate coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) with a Buy rating and a price target of $173.00.

The analysts comment ""Initiating coverage with a Buy rating and $173 target price. No other e-commerce platform comes close to matching the scale that Amazon has amassed. The company has the broadest selection of items that mirror overall retail sales, in many cases at the lowest prices, the broadest fulfillment network, and the most 3P seller resources available. While scale matters for its core retail business, it is also the foundation upon which its related businesses have been built (Prime, Advertising, etc.) in addition to the many tangential operations that contribute to the overall business today (AWS, subscriptions, hardware, etc.), as well as those that may reach greater scale in the future (Amazon Business, healthcare, and others). In the near-to-medium-term, we see (1) stabilization in cloud spending trends that should benefit AWS (we saw evidence of this in 2Q23), (2) upside to operating margins as the company looks to continue optimization of the massive increase of its fulfillment footprint during COVID (management believes it can get back to pre-COVID margins or better), and (3) continued growth in advertising as the company is set to launch ads in Prime Video in 2024."""
2022-10-16, Investing.com,Amazon’s Potential Embrace of Bitcoin Stirs Market Speculation,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-potential-embrace-of-bitcoin-stirs-market-speculation-93CH-3852594,"Speculation is mounting over the potential acceptance of cryptocurrencies such as by major retailers, with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) at the forefront of discussions. Despite smaller businesses beginning to accept Bitcoin, larger corporations including Amazon have remained hesitant due to concerns over crypto volatility, regulatory complexities, and gaps in consumer understanding.

The online retail giant stands to benefit from potential advantages such as increased customer convenience, attracting a crypto-friendly customer base, and enhancing the speed and cost-efficiency of international transactions. However, Amazon also faces challenges including Bitcoin's scalability issues, which could prove problematic given the retailer's high transaction volume. Other concerns include the volatile value of Bitcoin leading to accounting difficulties and the need for compliance with evolving global cryptocurrency regulations.

Nonetheless, Amazon's ongoing interest in blockchain technology, evidenced by its blockchain patents and services based on this technology, suggests a possible future acceptance of Bitcoin. As of Monday, there has been no official confirmation from Amazon regarding their position on accepting Bitcoin.

In related news, Apple (NASDAQ: ) does not currently accept Bitcoin directly for its products such as iPhones or MacBooks. Yet, in response to the growing influence of cryptocurrencies, the tech giant introduced ""CryptoKit"" in 2019. This tool assists developers in performing cryptographic operations for easier integration of cryptocurrencies into applications.

Apple's App Store guidelines permit apps like digital wallets and exchanges to transmit ""approved virtual currencies,"" provided they comply with laws and don't facilitate illegal activities or violate user privacy. However, these apps are prohibited from mining cryptocurrencies using an iPhone's resources to prevent potential damage.

Bitcoin's evolution into a valuable asset through platforms like Immediate Revolution has significantly impacted the global economy. This decentralized deflationary currency disrupts traditional financial norms and provides solutions for systemic issues. As a store of value or ""Digital ,"" Bitcoin represents change and innovation due to its finite supply and rising demand. It also facilitates efficient cross-border transactions. However, its future, referred to as Silicon’s Golden Child, is a blend of excitement and uncertainty due to rapid growth, price volatility, and regulatory challenges. Despite these risks, potential benefits such as providing financial autonomy to the unbanked population often outweigh the uncertainties. The underlying blockchain technology, the emergence of altcoins, and the avalanche of innovations it has triggered hold immense potential beyond finance.

2022-10-16, Investing.com,Netflix shifts focus amid competitive landscape and revenue growth concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-shifts-focus-amid-competitive-landscape-and-revenue-growth-concerns-93CH-3852540,"In the face of stiff competition from Disney, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Warner Bros., Comcast (NASDAQ: ), and Paramount Global, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is changing its strategy from subscriber growth to earnings maximization. This shift comes as the company implements post-Hollywood actors strike price hikes, launches an ad-supported service, and cracks down on shared accounts.

Netflix, a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, as pointed out by InvestingPro Tips, has been operating with a moderate level of debt. The company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, indicating its financial stability. However, the company's stock has taken a significant hit over the last week, as reflected in InvestingPro's real-time metrics, with a 1-week price total return of -7.84%.

The move follows the recent discontinuation of Netflix's DVD-rental service. Despite a surprising increase of 5.9 million subscribers in July, the company's third-quarter revenue guidance of $8.52 billion fell short of the expected $8.66 billion. In response to this lower than anticipated guidance, Jefferies analysts reduced their price target on Netflix shares.

Barclays (LON: ) analysts voiced concerns about weak revenue growth expectations for Netflix. Meanwhile, Needham predicts that linear TV will regain subscribers in the next 2-3 years.

Netflix shares have seen a significant increase this year, climbing 21% with an average price target of $459.47. This rise comes amidst Amazon's plan to raise streaming prices and Disney considering asset sales. Analysts' recommendations for Netflix shares are mixed: Wedbush analysts are bullish on Netflix, while Cowen analysts expect 6.5 million new paid subscribers with a mix of 23 buy, 20 hold, and two sell recommendations among analysts.

Amazon, another significant player in the industry, has seen a revenue growth acceleration, as per InvestingPro Tips. The company's net income is expected to grow this year, and it operates with a moderate level of debt. However, Amazon's stock has seen a 1-month price total return of -7.55%, according to InvestingPro's real-time metrics.

The InvestingPro platform offers additional tips and real-time metrics for both Netflix and Amazon, providing valuable insights to investors. For more information, visit the InvestingPro's pro/pricing page.

2022-10-15, IANS,Palestine's tech & startup industry bleeding amid Israel-Hamas war,https://in.investing.com/news/palestines-tech--startup-industry-bleeding-amid-israelhamas-war-3850577,"Jerusalem, Oct 15 (IANS) The Israel-Hamas war has blown apart Palestine's growing tech and startup industry that has seen several top-notch companies emerging from Gaza despite being one of the most economically challenged regions in the world.Those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has recently been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem, reports TechCrunch.

In 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff had backed the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.

Alphabet-backed initiative ‘Gaza Sky Geeks’ provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine’s Gazan population.

In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the programme.

Ibtikar, one of the main Palestinian VC funds, recently raised its second fund of $30 million.

High-growth companies emerging from Palestine include Menalytics (data analytics, invested in by Flat 6 labs); Olivery (last mile logistics, Flat6Labs and Ibtikar Fund); Coretava (employee and customer loyalty); and Sellenvo (an Amazon (NASDAQ: ) fulfillment partner).

Iliana Montauk, co-founder and CEO of social impact startup Manara, funded by Y Combinator and others, was quoted as saying that Gaza has been bombed many times before but “this time is completely different for the tech sector for several reasons”.

“Electricity was cut off to the entire Gaza strip. A significant amount of infrastructure has been bombed (including both ISPs and many tall apartment buildings that hold cell phone towers). Entire middle-class neighbourhoods are being destroyed,” she told TechCrunch.

“The tech sector is almost completely unable to function in Gaza right now,” she added.

Manara has around 100 software engineers in Gaza, some working remotely for tech companies in Silicon Valley in the US and Europe.

Most people have lost cell phone connections and internet access completely, or have some access to 2G only on their cell phones.

Mohammad Alnobani, founder of The Middle Frame, an Arab stock image platform powered by AI tools, was quoted as saying that “dealing with the situation while trying our best to move forward with our work is a daily challenge.”

Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it has been completing preparations for a ""significant ground operation"" in the Gaza Strip.

Tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers were being deployed at the border of Gaza in anticipation of a large ground operation, reports said on Sunday.

According to health authorities in Gaza, more than 1,900 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 7,700 wounded by Israeli airstrikes.

Israel said more than 1,300 people were killed during rocket attacks and deadly raids into territory by fighters from Hamas.

2022-10-13, Investing.com,Microsoft's Activision acquisition underscores Big Tech's vertical growth strategy,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-activision-acquisition-underscores-big-techs-vertical-growth-strategy-93CH-3849745,"Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) underlines the trend of Big Tech companies expanding through vertical transactions, a strategy also adopted by Meta (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ). This comes despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department to curtail such deals, with courts often expressing skepticism towards their arguments.

The FTC continues to contest Microsoft's acquisition, voicing concerns that it could lead to the tech giant dominating the game streaming market. As part of the deal, Microsoft has pledged to make one of Activision’s major game franchises available to other consoles for a decade in an effort to alleviate competition concerns.

This presumption in favor of vertical transactions has been entrenched since the late 1970s. However, President Biden’s top antitrust officials, FTC chair Lina Khan and Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter, have been actively challenging vertical mergers since their appointments in 2021.

In 2017, marking its first attempt to halt a vertical deal in decades, the Justice Department sought to block the $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (NYSE: ) and Time Warner. Despite these initiatives, judges frequently dismiss these challenges due to a perceived lack of evidence.

Microsoft also arrived at a settlement with the European Union, vowing to make Activision titles accessible to competitors in the emerging market for game streaming. This follows unsuccessful attempts by Khan's FTC in 2021 to prevent Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s acquisition of Arm and Lockheed Martin’s $4.4 billion purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ). The Justice Department's lawsuit against UnitedHealth (NYSE: ) Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: ) was similarly dismissed.

They argue that ""transformational AI growth and stabilizing IT spending environment will create a massive tech rally heading into year-end in which we expect tech stocks to be up another 12%-15% in 4Q.""

Despite the perplexing macroeconomic and bond market conditions, compounded by the disconcerting geopolitical aftermath of the recent terrorist attack in Israel, the analysts maintain their conviction that the technology sector is robust and well-prepared for a forthcoming earnings season that will defy the skeptics.

The analysts said they are using the macro and Fed worries as a time to ""double down on our bullish tech thesis....and NOT panic.""

They see tech stocks poised for robust growth, driven by AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and a digital ad rebound, overlooked by the market. Further, they anticipate 2024 Fed rate cuts, relieving the yield obsession, with a projected soft landing.

They are focused on generational AI growth and $1 trillion of tech spending over the next decade.

The analysts' favorite tech names remain Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto (NASDAQ: ), Palantir (NYSE: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ), and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ).

They added that the AI cycle will have a profound effect on the consumer Internet, commencing with cloud service divisions like Amazon's AWS and Alphabet's GCP. Both AWS and GCP are integrating AI-capable chips and services into their offerings for their existing customer bases. In line with this trend, our top tech picks remain Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: )."

In the first four days of the festive sale, the average daily sales were six times of business as usual (BAU), according to the report from Redseer Strategy Consultants.

This spike in sales was led by high average selling price (ASP) categories like mobiles, electronics and large appliances. Like in previous years, growth in low ASP categories like fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC) and home could gain traction later in the festive sale week, the report mentioned.

“The consumers took advantage of the ‘pre-book/price lock’ feature, an industry-first feature, wherein users could lock in the prices for these high value products, even before the festive sale started,” said the report.

Due to this, Day zero or the Early Access Day sale saw a 10 times increase in sales over the BAU while Day 1 saw a 7 times increase in sales over BAU.

Last week, e-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Flipkart, Myntra and others began the festive season sales which is expected to reach Rs 90,000 crore worth online GMV in the festive month -- up 18-20 per cent from last year’s festive month sales.

Amazon India said earlier this week that it witnessed a record 9.5 crore customer visits in the first 48 hours of its ‘Great Indian Festival 2022.’

On the other hand, e-commerce major Flipkart said that over 9.1 crore customers visited its Early Access sale and Day 1 of the 10th edition of its ‘Big Billion Days 2022’ festive sales.

However, recent worries over rising rates have led to losses ranging from 4.4% to 8% for AI ETFs.

Amazon has notably invested $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic. Meta has introduced generative AI tools for advertisers, while Zoom has launched products to compete with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), who have backed OpenAI. These investments underscore the disruptive potential of AI across various industries, as highlighted by KPMG U.S. chair Paul Knopp.

Despite the recent downturn, analysts predict substantial growth in AI sector investments. Wedbush analysts anticipate an additional trillion dollars of spend in the sector over the next decade. Concurrently, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) forecasts global AI investments to reach $200 billion by 2025 and peak at 4% of U.S. GDP.

CEOs anticipate returns on their AI investments within three to five years, indicating these investments are still in their early stages but hold transformative power. However, senior analysts at Jefferies warn that the AI investment trend is not a zero-sum game, suggesting that winners are likely to emerge from this trend.

This feature is part of Amazon's strategy to generate more revenue from its existing customer base. The ""Buy Again"" feed is featured prominently on the home page of the app and uses a customer's order history to provide recommendations, particularly in categories like groceries and electronics.

Amazon has faced challenges in recent years with slower growth in Prime memberships and reduced spending from its users. To address this, the company is striving to guide customers towards more frequent purchases and promote subscription-based ordering through the ""Subscribe & Save"" feature.

To encourage repeat orders, Amazon has previously used its Alexa assistant to suggest order options based on customers' order history. Promoting the subscription service can further cement Amazon's presence in users' lives and boost revenue from existing customers.

The rollout and future refinement of Amazon's ""Buy Again"" feature are still uncertain. Amazon has not confirmed whether it will make this tab available to all customers, and there may be changes made to it before an official launch.

Moreover, the effectiveness of the recommendation tool remains to be seen, as not all items on the site are conducive to repeat purchases. While Amazon does have a ""Buy Again"" and subscription option on its website, it doesn't always have a prominent placement.

Many customers can access similar information through the app, but it often requires navigating through multiple steps to reach this section."

In June, the firm said that it would increase workforce in Singapore as part of its expansion outside the U.S.

The firm partnered with marketing/analytics strategy consultants to survey 672 businesses to study how large enterprise decision-makers are viewing generative AI and their strategies, actions, and upcoming plans.

""Survey says Microsoft followed by Google are early leaders...while Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) are expected to narrow the gap,"" the analysts revealed.

""One of the top takeaways from the survey was Microsoft taking the early lead in the race with its OpenAI acquisition as the company has a significant AI monetization opportunity within Azure through Microsoft Co-Pilot while Google is also being viewed as a major Generative AI player now and down the road as it further improves Bard and its PaLM/LaMDA LLMs,"" the analysts added.

Wedbush said Microsoft and Google ""appear to be in the AI driver's seat,"" which they believe will be a battle over the next decade as they see other technology companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and other tech stalwarts collectively spending billions in the AI arms race over the coming years.

This comes despite ongoing efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Justice Department to curtail such deals, with courts often expressing skepticism towards their arguments.

The FTC continues to contest Microsoft's acquisition, voicing concerns that it could lead to the tech giant dominating the game streaming market. As part of the deal, Microsoft has pledged to make one of Activision’s major game franchises available to other consoles for a decade in an effort to alleviate competition concerns.

This presumption in favor of vertical transactions has been entrenched since the late 1970s. However, President Biden’s top antitrust officials, FTC chair Lina Khan and Justice Department's Jonathan Kanter, have been actively challenging vertical mergers since their appointments in 2021.

In 2017, marking its first attempt to halt a vertical deal in decades, the Justice Department sought to block the $85.4 billion merger between AT&T (NYSE: ) and Time Warner. Despite these initiatives, judges frequently dismiss these challenges due to a perceived lack of evidence.

Microsoft also arrived at a settlement with the European Union, vowing to make Activision titles accessible to competitors in the emerging market for game streaming. This follows unsuccessful attempts by Khan's FTC in 2021 to prevent Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s acquisition of Arm and Lockheed Martin’s $4.4 billion purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (NYSE: ). The Justice Department's lawsuit against UnitedHealth (NYSE: ) Group’s acquisition of Change Healthcare (NASDAQ: ) was similarly dismissed.

They argue that ""transformational AI growth and stabilizing IT spending environment will create a massive tech rally heading into year-end in which we expect tech stocks to be up another 12%-15% in 4Q.""

Despite the perplexing macroeconomic and bond market conditions, compounded by the disconcerting geopolitical aftermath of the recent terrorist attack in Israel, the analysts maintain their conviction that the technology sector is robust and well-prepared for a forthcoming earnings season that will defy the skeptics.

The analysts said they are using the macro and Fed worries as a time to ""double down on our bullish tech thesis....and NOT panic.""

They see tech stocks poised for robust growth, driven by AI, cloud, cybersecurity, and a digital ad rebound, overlooked by the market. Further, they anticipate 2024 Fed rate cuts, relieving the yield obsession, with a projected soft landing.

They are focused on generational AI growth and $1 trillion of tech spending over the next decade.

The analysts' favorite tech names remain Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Palo Alto (NASDAQ: ), Palantir (NYSE: ), Zscaler (NASDAQ: ), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: ), and MongoDB (NASDAQ: ).

They added that the AI cycle will have a profound effect on the consumer Internet, commencing with cloud service divisions like Amazon's AWS and Alphabet's GCP. Both AWS and GCP are integrating AI-capable chips and services into their offerings for their existing customer bases. In line with this trend, our top tech picks remain Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: )."

In the first four days of the festive sale, the average daily sales were six times of business as usual (BAU), according to the report from Redseer Strategy Consultants.

This spike in sales was led by high average selling price (ASP) categories like mobiles, electronics and large appliances. Like in previous years, growth in low ASP categories like fashion, beauty and personal care (BPC) and home could gain traction later in the festive sale week, the report mentioned.

“The consumers took advantage of the ‘pre-book/price lock’ feature, an industry-first feature, wherein users could lock in the prices for these high value products, even before the festive sale started,” said the report.

Due to this, Day zero or the Early Access Day sale saw a 10 times increase in sales over the BAU while Day 1 saw a 7 times increase in sales over BAU.

Last week, e-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Flipkart, Myntra and others began the festive season sales which is expected to reach Rs 90,000 crore worth online GMV in the festive month -- up 18-20 per cent from last year’s festive month sales.

Meta has introduced generative AI tools for advertisers, while Zoom has launched products to compete with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), who have backed OpenAI.

Despite the recent downturn, analysts predict substantial growth in AI sector investments. Wedbush analysts anticipate an additional trillion dollars of spend in the sector over the next decade. Concurrently, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) forecasts global AI investments to reach $200 billion by 2025 and peak at 4% of U.S. GDP.

CEOs anticipate returns on their AI investments within three to five years, indicating these investments are still in their early stages but hold transformative power.

2022-10-11, Investing.com,Amazon is testing new 'Buy Again' feature - WSJ,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-is-testing-new-buy-again-feature--wsj-432SI-3845203,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly testing a new feature on its app called ""Buy Again,"" which aims to encourage users to make repeat purchases, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

This feature is part of Amazon's strategy to generate more revenue from its existing customer base. The ""Buy Again"" feed is featured prominently on the home page of the app and uses a customer's order history to provide recommendations, particularly in categories like groceries and electronics.

Amazon has faced challenges in recent years with slower growth in Prime memberships and reduced spending from its users. To address this, the company is striving to guide customers towards more frequent purchases and promote subscription-based ordering through the ""Subscribe & Save"" feature.

To encourage repeat orders, Amazon has previously used its Alexa assistant to suggest order options based on customers' order history. Promoting the subscription service can further cement Amazon's presence in users' lives and boost revenue from existing customers.

The rollout and future refinement of Amazon's ""Buy Again"" feature are still uncertain. Amazon has not confirmed whether it will make this tab available to all customers, and there may be changes made to it before an official launch.

Moreover, the effectiveness of the recommendation tool remains to be seen, as not all items on the site are conducive to repeat purchases. While Amazon does have a ""Buy Again"" and subscription option on its website, it doesn't always have a prominent placement.

Many customers can access similar information through the app, but it often requires navigating through multiple steps to reach this section."

Yet, a number of industry specialists are guiding consumers to be prudent and potentially hold off for future sales events to secure superior deals.

Katie Roberts from DealNews.com, Kristin McGrath from BlackFriday.com, and Nicole Leinbach from the Independent Retailer Conference have all suggested waiting until Black Friday or Cyber Monday for better deals on new smartphones, especially iPhones. They recommend postponing purchases of Amazon Fire TV products, toys like Lego, and gaming consoles such as Sony (NYSE: ) PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch (NYSE: ).

Budgeting expert Andrea Woroch and consumer consultant Melissa Cid have also advised consumers to delay clothing and electronics purchases. They spotlighted Walmart (NYSE: ) as a possible source for iPhone deals during the Black Friday sales event.

Amazon devices, on the other hand, are anticipated to offer the most attractive deals during Prime Day. Although consumers may be drawn to Amazon's ""lightning deals,"" they are cautioned against impulsive buying. The article also referenced Taylor Swift in connection with furniture shopping, but it did not elaborate further on this topic.

In the backdrop of this upcoming Prime Day event is a trend initiated last year when Amazon rolled out a dual-event strategy for its annual sales bonanza. With the holiday season on the horizon, consumers are urged to thoughtfully consider their purchasing decisions to ensure they lock in the best possible deals.

InvestingPro's real-time metrics indicate that Amazon's market capitalization stands at a staggering 1300.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 99.88. The company has shown strong performance in recent times, boasting a revenue growth of 10.73% LTM2022.Q2 and a gross profit of 244.97B USD LTM2022.Q2. The firm's EBITDA growth is also impressive at 18.89% LTM2022.Q2.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Amazon's revenue growth has been accelerating and the company is expected to be profitable this year. The company also operates with a moderate level of debt. However, Amazon is trading at a high earnings multiple and a high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which could be a concern for some investors. It's worth noting that Amazon has experienced a large price uptick over the last six months, and has delivered a high return over the last decade, according to InvestingPro Tips.

2022-10-09, IANS,India’s norms against dark patterns may hurt ease of doing business: Big Tech coalition,https://in.investing.com/news/indias-norms-against-dark-patterns-may-hurt-ease-of-doing-business-big-tech-coalition-3841842,"New Delhi, Oct 9 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), that has Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Twitter, Google (NASDAQ: ) and other Big Tech companies as its members, has opposed the draft dark pattern guidelines by the Indian government, saying the move may stagnate the growth of India’s digital economy by having an adverse effect on the ease of doing business.The government released draft guidelines last month to curb “dark patterns” used by online platforms. These dark patterns mislead people into doing something they did not wish to do, such as paying for items or services they did not intend to buy.

The draft document, released by the Department of Consumer Affairs, was available on the department’s website where people could leave feedback until October 5.

In a letter sent to the Department of Consumer Affairs, the coalition argued that online platforms, and especially online advertisements, are already regulated under various existing laws in India.

“Existing laws in India already account for the regulation and prevention of dark patterns. Any attempt to introduce a separate regulatory framework would cause unnecessary regulatory overlap,” said the AIC.

This overlap will result in divergence across applicable legal frameworks leading to uncertainty in terms of compliance requirements. The combined effect would be a negative impact on the ease of doing business of these digital service providers, the coalition added.

For instance, the online platforms that qualify as online intermediaries are regulated under the Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act), whereas e-commerce platforms are regulated under the Consumer Protection Act 2019 (CPA).

Additionally, sector-agnostic obligations under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2022 (DPDP Act) also apply.

“Self-regulation can ensure that the attempt to regulate dark patterns is in harmony with these already existing obligations,” said the coalition.

Under the CPA, dark patterns such as drip pricing, disguised advertisements, false urgency, etc. are already regulated as they constitute unfair trade practices or misleading advertisements.

“The CPA and especially the Misleading Ads Guidelines act as a sector-agnostic regulation and any further regulation would lead to overlap with compliance requirements under it,” the coalition of Big Tech firms argued.

Dark patterns such as interface interference and subscription trap, which concern the privacy rights of consumers, can be tackled through the data processing obligations under the DPDP Act, it added.

“For instance, the data fiduciaries are required to obtain free, informed, and clear consent through an affirmative action for data collection. Therefore, principles of transparency and data minimisation are already an integral part of the obligations under the DPDP Act”.

The upcoming Digital India Act will also be well-equipped to regulate dark patterns on the internet through user safety provisions.

It is likely to impose obligations on online platforms and digital services to ensure user safety on the internet.

The coalition urged the Indian government to consider adopting the approach taken by the European Union which is already at an advanced stage of regulating dark patterns.

“The EU already had various principle-based obligations that were imposed on online service providers through directives such as the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the Digital Services Act, and the General Data Protection Regulation,” said the Coalition.

In case the government feels a separate regulatory framework is required, “then we suggest that such regulation be sector and medium-agnostic and apply to both offline and online content and advertisements,” the letter read.

2022-10-09, IANS,Amazon’s Alexa claimed 2020 US Prez election was ‘stolen’: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-alexa-claimed-2020-us-prez-election-was-stolen-report-3841316,"San Francisco, Oct 9 (IANS) Amazon’s smart assistant Alexa has reportedly claimed that the 2020 US presidential election was “stolen by a massive amount of election fraud”, as concerns rise over artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots and virtual assistants spreading misinformation.Asked about fraud in the election race, in which Joe Biden defeated former president Donald Trump with 306 electoral college votes, Alexa said it was “stolen by a massive amount of election fraud,” citing Rumble, a video-streaming service favoured by conservatives, reports The Washington Post.

Amid concerns that the rise of artificial intelligence will supercharge the spread of misinformation comes a wild fabrication from a more prosaic source: Amazon’s Alexa, which declared that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

The 2020 races were “notorious for many incidents of irregularities and indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers,” according to Alexa, referencing subscription newsletter service Substack.

Alexa contended that Trump won Pennsylvania, citing “an Alexa answers contributor"".

However, multiple investigations into the 2020 US election found no evidence of fraud.

“Yet Alexa disseminates misinformation about the race, even as parent company Amazon (NASDAQ: ) promotes the tool as a reliable election news source to more than 70 million estimated users,” the report said late on Sunday.

An Amazon spokesperson said that these responses were “errors that were delivered a small number of times, and quickly fixed when brought to our attention”.

“We continually audit and improve the systems we have in place for detecting and blocking inaccurate content,” said the company.

After the report, Alexa’s responses changed.

Voice assistants and advanced chatbots are only as accurate as the websites, news reports and other data they draw from across the web.

“These tools risk baking in and amplifying the falsehoods and biases present in their sources,” the report mentioned.

In recent years, Amazon’s Alexa has proliferated across a number of devices.

2022-10-08, IANS,"Biden's 2024 campaign in risk of losing corporate funding, CEO support due to his pro-labour stance",https://in.investing.com/news/bidens-2024-campaign-in-risk-of-losing-corporate-funding-ceo-support-due-to-his-prolabour-stance-3841093,"Washington, Oct 8 (IANS) US President Joe Biden's 2024 campaign for a 2nd term in the White House faces the danger of losing corporate funding and CEO support owing to his pro-labour rhetoric and stand on the United Auto Workers Strike.Biden's tight alliance with organised labour has unnerved some of his business supporters that they fear he might lose the support of the corporate world and their honchos due to his rhetoric and administrations actions.

They want Biden to send out a strong message to the corporate world that he is on their side with policies to promote and grow their businesses.

An US media report said Biden's political advisers have directly urged the President to state bluntly that he wants to help business succeed -- a message that seems to be getting lost when he courts working class voters and embraces their cause for better pay and working conditions, NBC reported.

A top political ally, requesting anonymity, said Biden needs to reassure them of the US government support and policies that will help the corporate world.

In one of his speeches where Biden said in favour of labour: ""You deserve what you've earned, and you've earned a hell of a lot more than you’re getting paid now"", has completely unnerved his supporters.

Biden while standing at the picket line with the workers of the UAW in Michigan seemed to extend silent support when the union leader Shawn Fain blasted through a bull horn ""CEOs sit in their offices, they sit in meetings, and they make decisions. But we make the product"".

Much of the criticism Biden faces are triggered mostly by the sudden shift in stance away from businesses because under the previous Donald Trump administration business flourished with tax cuts and deregulatory measures.

Most of the tax cuts that Donald Trump signed into law in 2017 ended up benefiting corporations and higher-income individuals, a Congressional Research Service report shows.

Business leaders today are ruffled by the presence of Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan, a Biden appointee, whom they see along with heads of other regulatory agencies overseeing labour and consumer relations, as impediments to competition and survival in the marketplace, media reports said .

""Biden at his core is a blue-collar guy from Scranton. He has never worked in business and he does not have any particular interest in those issues and I don't criticize him for that,"" said Steven Rattner, a long-time Democratic donor, who headed the auto industry task force in the Barack Obama administration.

""Rightly or wrongly, there's a perception that there's a fair amount of hostility toward business, and that makes the business community nervous,"" he said.

The business community has felt ignored by the Biden administration and has nurtured hostility towards Lina Khan, who they see as someone who had rankled top businesses by targeting large companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). And that brings an element of uncertainty in the future corporate entities mergers and their trust in his policies.

Though the incumbent president Biden can marshal enough resources to his campaign for presidency in 2024, what is worrying his pro-business supporters is that a general apathy is setting in the corporate world in the potential rematch between Biden and Trump, the businessman.

Biden is leading the Democratic party to the left adopting progressive views that concentrated wealth and business power are corrosive to working-class advancement.

A political fundraiser reportedly said he heard from senior CEOs saying: ""I don't really love Trump. On the other hand, how bad could it be? He gave me a bunch of money and he didn't f--- with me the way Biden is'. That's made it difficult for us to rally business support for Biden as much as we'd like.""

The White House has however countered the propaganda that Biden is anti-business stating that on the contrary the President has been a boon to the business world by making substantial investments in new roads and bridges, while pursuing renewable energy projects that create new jobs. Some 336,000 new jobs were created in the month of September, a number that almost doubled Wall Street expectations, which demonstrate that Biden's policies, are pro-business and pro-growth and pro economy.

Musk, who is already providing cheaper Internet broadband services in various parts of the world via SpaceX’s Starlink service, replied: “Congrats, this is hard!”

Amazon’s Project Kuiper, its low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband initiative, aims to have a constellation of over 3,200 in low Earth orbit to compete with Musk’s Starlink, which currently has over 4,000 satellites in space to beam affordable Internet. Amazon’s first production satellites are on track for launch in the first half of 2024, and the company expects to be in beta testing with early commercial customers by the end of 2024.

“The launch started a new phase of our ‘Protoflight’ mission, and there’s a long way to go, but it’s an exciting milestone all the same,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. “I’m tremendously grateful to the Project Kuiper team for their dedication in getting us to this point, and to our partners at United Launch Alliance who helped us deploy our first spacecraft ever into orbit,” Badyal added.

In July, Amazon announced it is building a $120 million facility for its Project Kuiper satellites in the US. The space will be used to prepare and integrate Kuiper satellites with rockets from Bezos’ Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance (ULA) ahead of launches.

Project Kuiper infrastructure includes a constellation of over 3,200 satellites in low Earth orbit, affordable, high-performance customer terminals, and ground networking enabled by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The HONOR 90 5G device comes in two variants -- 12GB +512 GB and 8+256 GB, which, coupled with RAM Turbo, gives up to 5GB on 8GB RAM variant and 7GB on 12GB variant.

Let us see if this device can create ripples in the Indian market.

First of all, the all-new triple camera system consists of a 200MP Main Camera with a 1/1.4-inch sensor, which by prioritising excellence in clarity, HDR capabilities, and low-light performance, delivers outstanding photographic results.

The triple camera has a 12MP ultra-wide and macro camera with a 112-degree field of view and a 2MP Depth Camera that helps the camera gauge distances accurately.

This camera is supported with multi-frame fusion, noise reduction algorithm and pixel binning to give a light-capturing performance that is equivalent to large 2.24 micrometer pixels (16-in-1).

The 200MP main camera resulted in outstanding high dynamic range (HDR) photos and detailed, bright images even in low-light situations. For selfie lovers, Honor 90 sports a 50MP camera which helps capture good images.

With the Portrait Mode, you can effortlessly create exceptional portraits that have well-defined facial features, accurate skin tones and produce an authentic bokeh effect that naturally blends the background with the main subject.

To offer photographers greater flexibility, the Portrait Mode lets users capture photos at 2X zoom to produce results that better highlight subjects in frames.

Additionally, the smartphone harnesses the immense power of the processor to deliver 4K video recording at 30fps from all three cameras - 200 MP Main Camera, 12 MP Ultrawide Camera and 50 MP Selfie Camera.

While shooting in 4k, in one single take, users can smoothly transition between Main, Ultrawide, and front camera without stopping the 4k recording.

For vloggers, the device helps denoise audio, makes video mode recommendations, and comes with an AI Vlog Assistant that lets users generate a social media-ready 15-second video with just a few taps.

On the battery front, it houses a 5000mAh battery for day-long usage. In our test, it gave up to 16-17 hours of life with occasional video streaming, social media, and daily work tasks.

With its Built-in AI power-saving technology, the device optimises battery performance and enhances efficiency, which enables maximum productivity even during intensive use.

The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 accelerated edition processor, which has 20 per cent better GPU performance and a 30 per cent better AI performance than the phone’s predecessor.

HONOR 90 runs on the latest Android 13-based MagicOS 7.1, and packs a punch with enhanced smart features like Magic Text, which provides a smart life experience and maximizes productivity.

The smartphone comes in two storage variants 8+256 GB and 12+512 GB priced at Rs 37,999 and Rs 39,999, respectively.

""This is when the satellite and one of our telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) antennas established a telemetry link for the first time,” the company said late on Friday.

The Atlas V rocket that carried the Kuiper satellites to space was launched around midnight on Friday.

It carried two prototype satellites from Amazon’s Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband initiative, into space before deploying them at an altitude of 500 kms above Earth.

“The launch today started a new phase of our ‘Protoflight’ mission, and there’s a long way to go, but it’s an exciting milestone all the same,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper.

“I’m tremendously grateful to the Project Kuiper team for their dedication in getting us to this point, and to our partners at United Launch Alliance who helped us deploy our first spacecraft ever into orbit,” Badyal added.

First contact is one of several key steps in the ‘Protoflight’ mission.

“It allows us to begin downlinking data on satellite health and establish more regular communications with the satellites,” the company added.

At the end of the mission, the company plans to actively de-orbit both satellites before they ultimately burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.

The company aims to have a constellation of over 3,200 in low Earth orbit to compete with Elon Musk’s Starlink, which currently has over 4,000 satellites in space to beam affordable Internet.

Its first production satellites are on track for launch in the first half of 2024, and Amazon expects to be in beta testing with early commercial customers by the end of 2024.

2022-10-06, Investing.com,Tech Giants See Premarket Shares Decline Following Strong September Jobs Report,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-see-premarket-shares-decline-following-strong-september-jobs-report-93CH-3839822,"The Magnificent 7 tech giants, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), witnessed a decline in their premarket trading shares on Friday. The downturn was triggered by a robust September jobs report, which exceeded expectations and reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve terminating its interest rate hike policy.

The stronger-than-expected jobs data has increased pressure on equity valuations, a factor that has been influencing the stock market for some time. This is because a strong labor market could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than previously anticipated, which could potentially make borrowing more expensive and slow down economic growth.

This downward trend was not confined to individual stocks but also impacted index trackers. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: ) and Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the , both reversed from initial gains to losses following the release of the jobs data. These ETFs are often seen as barometers for broader market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be reevaluating their positions in light of the latest economic indicators.

The Friday downturn comes amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties and concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves and any further economic data that could influence market trends.

Boult Audio, with a keen focus on affordability, strategically launched a series of new models priced below $25, effectively drawing in customers.

Additionally, they offered an up to 80 per cent discount on their audio products during the Noise Anniversary Sales in 2022.

The enhanced performance of models in the $25 and below (retail price) segment also played a significant role in boosting sales, the report mentioned.

Looking forward, the global TWS market’s sales volume is set to grow by 2 per cent YoY in 2022, but revenue will decrease by 3 per cent YoY.

Yet, a number of industry specialists are guiding consumers to be prudent and potentially hold off for future sales events to secure superior deals.

Katie Roberts from DealNews.com, Kristin McGrath from BlackFriday.com, and Nicole Leinbach from the Independent Retailer Conference have all suggested waiting until Black Friday or Cyber Monday for better deals on new smartphones, especially iPhones. They recommend postponing purchases of Amazon Fire TV products, toys like Lego, and gaming consoles such as Sony (NYSE: ) PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch (NYSE: ).

Budgeting expert Andrea Woroch and consumer consultant Melissa Cid have also advised consumers to delay clothing and electronics purchases. They spotlighted Walmart (NYSE: ) as a possible source for iPhone deals during the Black Friday sales event.

Amazon devices, on the other hand, are anticipated to offer the most attractive deals during Prime Day. Although consumers may be drawn to Amazon's ""lightning deals,"" they are cautioned against impulsive buying. The article also referenced Taylor Swift in connection with furniture shopping, but it did not elaborate further on this topic.

In the backdrop of this upcoming Prime Day event is a trend initiated last year when Amazon rolled out a dual-event strategy for its annual sales bonanza. With the holiday season on the horizon, consumers are urged to thoughtfully consider their purchasing decisions to ensure they lock in the best possible deals.

InvestingPro's real-time metrics indicate that Amazon's market capitalization stands at a staggering 1300.0B USD, with a P/E ratio of 99.88. The company has shown strong performance in recent times, boasting a revenue growth of 10.73% LTM2022.Q2 and a gross profit of 244.97B USD LTM2022.Q2. The firm's EBITDA growth is also impressive at 18.89% LTM2022.Q2.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Amazon's revenue growth has been accelerating and the company is expected to be profitable this year. The company also operates with a moderate level of debt. However, Amazon is trading at a high earnings multiple and a high P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth, which could be a concern for some investors. It's worth noting that Amazon has experienced a large price uptick over the last six months, and has delivered a high return over the last decade, according to InvestingPro Tips.

2022-10-09, IANS,India’s norms against dark patterns may hurt ease of doing business: Big Tech coalition,https://in.investing.com/news/indias-norms-against-dark-patterns-may-hurt-ease-of-doing-business-big-tech-coalition-3841842,"New Delhi, Oct 9 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), that has Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Twitter, Google (NASDAQ: ) and other Big Tech companies as its members, has opposed the draft dark pattern guidelines by the Indian government, saying the move may stagnate the growth of India’s digital economy by having an adverse effect on the ease of doing business.The government released draft guidelines last month to curb “dark patterns” used by online platforms. These dark patterns mislead people into doing something they did not wish to do, such as paying for items or services they did not intend to buy.

The draft document, released by the Department of Consumer Affairs, was available on the department’s website where people could leave feedback until October 5.

In a letter sent to the Department of Consumer Affairs, the coalition argued that online platforms, and especially online advertisements, are already regulated under various existing laws in India.

“Existing laws in India already account for the regulation and prevention of dark patterns. Any attempt to introduce a separate regulatory framework would cause unnecessary regulatory overlap,” said the AIC.

This overlap will result in divergence across applicable legal frameworks leading to uncertainty in terms of compliance requirements. The combined effect would be a negative impact on the ease of doing business of these digital service providers, the coalition added.

For instance, the online platforms that qualify as online intermediaries are regulated under the Information Technology Act 2000 (IT Act), whereas e-commerce platforms are regulated under the Consumer Protection Act 2019 (CPA).

Additionally, sector-agnostic obligations under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2022 (DPDP Act) also apply.

“Self-regulation can ensure that the attempt to regulate dark patterns is in harmony with these already existing obligations,” said the coalition.

Under the CPA, dark patterns such as drip pricing, disguised advertisements, false urgency, etc. are already regulated as they constitute unfair trade practices or misleading advertisements.

“The CPA and especially the Misleading Ads Guidelines act as a sector-agnostic regulation and any further regulation would lead to overlap with compliance requirements under it,” the coalition of Big Tech firms argued.

Dark patterns such as interface interference and subscription trap, which concern the privacy rights of consumers, can be tackled through the data processing obligations under the DPDP Act, it added.

“For instance, the data fiduciaries are required to obtain free, informed, and clear consent through an affirmative action for data collection. Therefore, principles of transparency and data minimisation are already an integral part of the obligations under the DPDP Act”.

The upcoming Digital India Act will also be well-equipped to regulate dark patterns on the internet through user safety provisions.

It is likely to impose obligations on online platforms and digital services to ensure user safety on the internet.

The coalition urged the Indian government to consider adopting the approach taken by the European Union which is already at an advanced stage of regulating dark patterns.

“The EU already had various principle-based obligations that were imposed on online service providers through directives such as the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the Digital Services Act, and the General Data Protection Regulation,” said the Coalition.

In case the government feels a separate regulatory framework is required, “then we suggest that such regulation be sector and medium-agnostic and apply to both offline and online content and advertisements,” the letter read.

2022-10-09, IANS,Amazon’s Alexa claimed 2020 US Prez election was ‘stolen’: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-alexa-claimed-2020-us-prez-election-was-stolen-report-3841316,"San Francisco, Oct 9 (IANS) Amazon’s smart assistant Alexa has reportedly claimed that the 2020 US presidential election was “stolen by a massive amount of election fraud”, as concerns rise over artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots and virtual assistants spreading misinformation.Asked about fraud in the election race, in which Joe Biden defeated former president Donald Trump with 306 electoral college votes, Alexa said it was “stolen by a massive amount of election fraud,” citing Rumble, a video-streaming service favoured by conservatives, reports The Washington Post.

Amid concerns that the rise of artificial intelligence will supercharge the spread of misinformation comes a wild fabrication from a more prosaic source: Amazon’s Alexa, which declared that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

The 2020 races were “notorious for many incidents of irregularities and indications pointing to electoral fraud taking place in major metro centers,” according to Alexa, referencing subscription newsletter service Substack.

Alexa contended that Trump won Pennsylvania, citing “an Alexa answers contributor"".

However, multiple investigations into the 2020 US election found no evidence of fraud.

“Yet Alexa disseminates misinformation about the race, even as parent company Amazon (NASDAQ: ) promotes the tool as a reliable election news source to more than 70 million estimated users,” the report said late on Sunday.

An Amazon spokesperson said that these responses were “errors that were delivered a small number of times, and quickly fixed when brought to our attention”.

“We continually audit and improve the systems we have in place for detecting and blocking inaccurate content,” said the company.

After the report, Alexa’s responses changed.

Voice assistants and advanced chatbots are only as accurate as the websites, news reports and other data they draw from across the web.

“These tools risk baking in and amplifying the falsehoods and biases present in their sources,” the report mentioned.

In recent years, Amazon’s Alexa has proliferated across a number of devices.

2022-10-08, IANS,"Biden's 2024 campaign in risk of losing corporate funding, CEO support due to his pro-labour stance",https://in.investing.com/news/bidens-2024-campaign-in-risk-of-losing-corporate-funding-ceo-support-due-to-his-prolabour-stance-3841093,"Washington, Oct 8 (IANS) US President Joe Biden's 2024 campaign for a 2nd term in the White House faces the danger of losing corporate funding and CEO support owing to his pro-labour rhetoric and stand on the United Auto Workers Strike.Biden's tight alliance with organised labour has unnerved some of his business supporters that they fear he might lose the support of the corporate world and their honchos due to his rhetoric and administrations actions.

They want Biden to send out a strong message to the corporate world that he is on their side with policies to promote and grow their businesses.

An US media report said Biden's political advisers have directly urged the President to state bluntly that he wants to help business succeed -- a message that seems to be getting lost when he courts working class voters and embraces their cause for better pay and working conditions, NBC reported.

A top political ally, requesting anonymity, said Biden needs to reassure them of the US government support and policies that will help the corporate world.

In one of his speeches where Biden said in favour of labour: ""You deserve what you've earned, and you've earned a hell of a lot more than you’re getting paid now"", has completely unnerved his supporters.

Biden while standing at the picket line with the workers of the UAW in Michigan seemed to extend silent support when the union leader Shawn Fain blasted through a bull horn ""CEOs sit in their offices, they sit in meetings, and they make decisions. But we make the product"".

Much of the criticism Biden faces are triggered mostly by the sudden shift in stance away from businesses because under the previous Donald Trump administration business flourished with tax cuts and deregulatory measures.

Most of the tax cuts that Donald Trump signed into law in 2017 ended up benefiting corporations and higher-income individuals, a Congressional Research Service report shows.

Business leaders today are ruffled by the presence of Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Lina Khan, a Biden appointee, whom they see along with heads of other regulatory agencies overseeing labour and consumer relations, as impediments to competition and survival in the marketplace, media reports said .

""Biden at his core is a blue-collar guy from Scranton. He has never worked in business and he does not have any particular interest in those issues and I don't criticize him for that,"" said Steven Rattner, a long-time Democratic donor, who headed the auto industry task force in the Barack Obama administration.

""Rightly or wrongly, there's a perception that there's a fair amount of hostility toward business, and that makes the business community nervous,"" he said.

The business community has felt ignored by the Biden administration and has nurtured hostility towards Lina Khan, who they see as someone who had rankled top businesses by targeting large companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). And that brings an element of uncertainty in the future corporate entities mergers and their trust in his policies.

Though the incumbent president Biden can marshal enough resources to his campaign for presidency in 2024, what is worrying his pro-business supporters is that a general apathy is setting in the corporate world in the potential rematch between Biden and Trump, the businessman.

Biden is leading the Democratic party to the left adopting progressive views that concentrated wealth and business power are corrosive to working-class advancement.

A political fundraiser reportedly said he heard from senior CEOs saying: ""I don't really love Trump. On the other hand, how bad could it be? He gave me a bunch of money and he didn't f--- with me the way Biden is'. That's made it difficult for us to rally business support for Biden as much as we'd like.""

The White House has however countered the propaganda that Biden is anti-business stating that on the contrary the President has been a boon to the business world by making substantial investments in new roads and bridges, while pursuing renewable energy projects that create new jobs. Some 336,000 new jobs were created in the month of September, a number that almost doubled Wall Street expectations, which demonstrate that Biden's policies, are pro-business and pro-growth and pro economy.

Musk, who is already providing cheaper Internet broadband services in various parts of the world via SpaceX’s Starlink service, replied: “Congrats, this is hard!”

Amazon’s Project Kuiper, its low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband initiative, aims to have a constellation of over 3,200 in low Earth orbit to compete with Musk’s Starlink, which currently has over 4,000 satellites in space to beam affordable Internet. Amazon’s first production satellites are on track for launch in the first half of 2024, and the company expects to be in beta testing with early commercial customers by the end of 2024.

“The launch started a new phase of our ‘Protoflight’ mission, and there’s a long way to go, but it’s an exciting milestone all the same,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. “I’m tremendously grateful to the Project Kuiper team for their dedication in getting us to this point, and to our partners at United Launch Alliance who helped us deploy our first spacecraft ever into orbit,” Badyal added.

In July, Amazon announced it is building a $120 million facility for its Project Kuiper satellites in the US. The space will be used to prepare and integrate Kuiper satellites with rockets from Bezos’ Blue Origin and United Launch Alliance (ULA) ahead of launches.

Project Kuiper infrastructure includes a constellation of over 3,200 satellites in low Earth orbit, affordable, high-performance customer terminals, and ground networking enabled by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The HONOR 90 5G device comes in two variants -- 12GB +512 GB and 8+256 GB, which, coupled with RAM Turbo, gives up to 5GB on 8GB RAM variant and 7GB on 12GB variant.

Let us see if this device can create ripples in the Indian market.

First of all, the all-new triple camera system consists of a 200MP Main Camera with a 1/1.4-inch sensor, which by prioritising excellence in clarity, HDR capabilities, and low-light performance, delivers outstanding photographic results.

The triple camera has a 12MP ultra-wide and macro camera with a 112-degree field of view and a 2MP Depth Camera that helps the camera gauge distances accurately.

This camera is supported with multi-frame fusion, noise reduction algorithm and pixel binning to give a light-capturing performance that is equivalent to large 2.24 micrometer pixels (16-in-1).

The 200MP main camera resulted in outstanding high dynamic range (HDR) photos and detailed, bright images even in low-light situations. For selfie lovers, Honor 90 sports a 50MP camera which helps capture good images.

With the Portrait Mode, you can effortlessly create exceptional portraits that have well-defined facial features, accurate skin tones and produce an authentic bokeh effect that naturally blends the background with the main subject.

Additionally, the smartphone harnesses the immense power of the processor to deliver 4K video recording at 30fps from all three cameras - 200 MP Main Camera, 12 MP Ultrawide Camera and 50 MP Selfie Camera.

While shooting in 4k, in one single take, users can smoothly transition between Main, Ultrawide, and front camera without stopping the 4k recording.

For vloggers, the device helps denoise audio, makes video mode recommendations, and comes with an AI Vlog Assistant that lets users generate a social media-ready 15-second video with just a few taps.

Furthermore, with omnidirectional noise reduction that has a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, you can capture solid and clear human voices and zero of the surrounding noise - close to that of a professional recorder.

Design-wise, HONOR 90 offers a slim 7.8mm thin design with 183g weight. It comes with gracefully quad-curved edges.

Honor 90 offers deeply reinforced glass, demonstrating exceptional robustness and enabling the curved display to withstand being dropped any number of times.

2022-10-07, IANS,Amazon launches its first Kuiper satellites to beam affordable Internet,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-launches-its-first-kuiper-satellites-to-beam-affordable-internet-3840339,"San Francisco, Oct 7 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has successfully launched its first two Kuiper satellites into space, with an aim to beam affordable internet on Earth like Elon Musk’s Starlink.Amazon said that it hit its first major mission milestone “when our mission operations center in Redmond, Washington, confirmed first contact with KuiperSat-2"".

""This is when the satellite and one of our telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) antennas established a telemetry link for the first time,” the company said late on Friday.

The Atlas V rocket that carried the Kuiper satellites to space was launched around midnight on Friday.

It carried two prototype satellites from Amazon’s Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite broadband initiative, into space before deploying them at an altitude of 500 kms above Earth.

“The launch today started a new phase of our ‘Protoflight’ mission, and there’s a long way to go, but it’s an exciting milestone all the same,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper.

“I’m tremendously grateful to the Project Kuiper team for their dedication in getting us to this point, and to our partners at United Launch Alliance who helped us deploy our first spacecraft ever into orbit,” Badyal added.

First contact is one of several key steps in the ‘Protoflight’ mission.

“It allows us to begin downlinking data on satellite health and establish more regular communications with the satellites,” the company added.

At the end of the mission, the company plans to actively de-orbit both satellites before they ultimately burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.

The company aims to have a constellation of over 3,200 in low Earth orbit to compete with Elon Musk’s Starlink, which currently has over 4,000 satellites in space to beam affordable Internet.

Its first production satellites are on track for launch in the first half of 2024, and Amazon expects to be in beta testing with early commercial customers by the end of 2024.

2022-10-06, Investing.com,Tech Giants See Premarket Shares Decline Following Strong September Jobs Report,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-see-premarket-shares-decline-following-strong-september-jobs-report-93CH-3839822,"The Magnificent 7 tech giants, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), witnessed a decline in their premarket trading shares on Friday. The downturn was triggered by a robust September jobs report, which exceeded expectations and reduced the likelihood of the Federal Reserve terminating its interest rate hike policy.

The stronger-than-expected jobs data has increased pressure on equity valuations, a factor that has been influencing the stock market for some time. This is because a strong labor market could prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than previously anticipated, which could potentially make borrowing more expensive and slow down economic growth.

This downward trend was not confined to individual stocks but also impacted index trackers. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: ) and Invesco QQQ ETF, which tracks the , both reversed from initial gains to losses following the release of the jobs data. These ETFs are often seen as barometers for broader market sentiment, suggesting that investors may be reevaluating their positions in light of the latest economic indicators.

The Friday downturn comes amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties and concerns about inflation and potential interest rate hikes. Investors will be closely watching the Federal Reserve's next moves and any further economic data that could influence market trends.

The initiative debuted at Chicago's United Center on Friday. This collaboration comes as the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) has seen a nearly 50% decline over the past three years, creating a stock-picker's market within the sector.

Despite the industry-wide slump, Shift4 has reported robust growth in payment volume. In Q2 2022, the company noted a 59% YoY increase and a 487% rise since Q2 2019. This growth is largely due to a strategic shift in the company's business model. Previously focusing primarily on serving restaurants, Shift4 has now begun signing contracts with larger venues such as resorts and casinos.

The partnership with Amazon is designed to enhance customer experience through checkout-free shopping rather than directly increasing revenue. However, Shift4's profitability has been outpacing its revenue growth, suggesting a successful transition in strategy.

Looking ahead, Shift4 plans further expansion through ticketing services for large venues and cross-border payments. This follows its acquisition of Finaro, indicating an ambitious growth trajectory despite the challenging conditions in the fintech sector.

2022-10-06, IANS,Netflix yet to scale up India biz due to lack of local content: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-yet-to-scale-up-india-biz-due-to-lack-of-local-content-report-3839412,"San Francisco, Oct 6 (IANS) With about 65 lakh subscribers in the country at the moment, streaming major Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has reportedly ""not succeeded"" in scaling up its business in the key Indian market. Netflix’s slower growth in India is primarily owing to the lack of local content, TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing analysts at global asset management firm AllianceBernstein.

The analysts reportedly said that only ""12 per cent of the titles"" Netflix offers in India were local content.

In comparison, nearly 60 per cent of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video’s offerings were in domestic languages in the country. Prime Video has about 2 crore subscribers in India and Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers, said the report.

""Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video,"" write the analysts.

""India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,"" they added in a note.

Netflix was yet to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, a significant price reduction in subscription tiers in India helped Netflix grow engagement in the country by nearly 30 per cent (year on year) in the first quarter of 2022. Over time, Netflix has adapted our prices to meet local needs and to further deepen its penetration, it lowered prices in India by 20-60 per cent.

""These reductions -- combined with an improved slate -- helped grow engagement in India by nearly 30 per cent year on year while F/X neutral revenue growth in 2022 accelerated to 24 per cent (versus 19 per cent in 2021),"" the company said in its quarter earnings report.

Streaming giant Netflix is reportedly planning to increase the price of its streaming service again -- starting with the US and Canada first -- to make up for the revenue lost during the Hollywood strike, a media report said.

Learning from the success in India, Netflix reduced prices in an additional 116 countries in Q1. Streaming giant Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

The investigation follows a study by Ofcom into the £7.5 billion sector, which has seen rapid adoption of remote computing resources.

Notably, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), who together control between 70% and 80% of Britain's sector, will be under special scrutiny.

The probe will focus on various aspects such as egress fees, discounts, and technical barriers that may prevent customers from switching providers. In addition, the software licensing practices of certain providers, specifically Microsoft, will also be examined.

This investigation forms part of a broader initiative by the CMA under its upcoming Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill. This initiative was outlined in its 2022 to 2024 Annual Plan.

The conclusions drawn from this investigation are expected to be published on the Cloud Services Market Investigation case page by April 2025. The CMA inquiry group is expected to release a statement soon outlining proposed focus areas for this crucial investigation.

On Thursday, Ofcom referred the matter to the CMA, led by Sarah Cardell.

The CMA's independent inquiry group will scrutinize these issues further and propose any necessary actions. The investigation is expected to wrap up by April 2025.

The escalation of the investigation comes amid concerns over anti-competitive behaviors like egress fees, interoperability restrictions, and committed spend discounts. While Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud's Amit Zavery has voiced support for Ofcom's stance against vendor lock-in, AWS has countered Ofcom's findings.

AWS criticized Ofcom's approach as a ""fundamental misconception"" of the IT sector. The company warned that the investigation could lead to ""unintended harm to IT customers"" while emphasizing its commitment to promoting ""robust competition among IT providers"".

Dominated by 'hyperscalers' Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Google (NASDAQ: ), these companies are now under scrutiny by regulatory bodies for practices that could harm competition and impact the UK economy.

The investigation was initiated by Ofcom under the Enterprise Act 2002 and is led by Fergal Farragher. The study reveals practices such as high egress fees, technical barriers to data portability, and committed spend discounts. These practices could potentially limit competitors from effectively challenging the market leaders due to the high profitability of AWS and Microsoft and the difficulty in customer switching.

Industries such as telecommunications, broadcasting, and public services that heavily rely on cloud computing could be impacted by these practices. Acknowledging the potential implications on the UK's digital economy, Ofcom has referred these concerns to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for a more detailed investigation.

The CMA investigation, led by Sarah Cardell, echoes similar probes into public sector cloud services in the EU. The responses from AWS and Microsoft to the findings have varied. While Microsoft has pledged commitment to competition, AWS disputed the findings and claimed no separate fees for switching providers.

These investigations underscore the essential role of cloud services in businesses and potential competitive harm. The outcome of this probe will decide whether action should be taken against these dominant players in the market.

In its market study, Ofcom identified a number of features in the supply of cloud services that make it more difficult for customers to switch and use multiple cloud suppliers.

Ofcom has estimated that the market for cloud services in the UK was worth up to 7.5 billion pounds in 2022.

“We welcome Ofcom’s referral of public cloud infrastructure services to us for in-depth scrutiny. This is a 7.5 billion pounds market that underpins a whole host of online services -- from social media to AI foundation models,” said Sarah Cardell, CEO of the CMA.

The features which Ofcom is most concerned about are charges that cloud customers must pay to move their data out of the cloud.

The media regulator is also concerned about discounts which may incentivise customers to use only one cloud provider and technical barriers to switching, which may prevent customers from being able to switch between different clouds or use more than one provider.

The Ofcom study found that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft had a combined market share of supply by revenue in the UK public cloud infrastructure services market of 70-80 per cent in 2022.

“The CMA’s independent inquiry group will now carry out an investigation to determine whether competition in this market is working well and if not, what action should be taken to address any issues it finds,” said Cardell.

The CMA has appointed independent panel members to an inquiry group, who will act as the decision makers on this investigation.

The CMA will conclude its investigation by April 2025.

The probe, led by CMA CEO Sarah Cardell, was sparked on Thursday, following a year-long investigation by Ofcom that highlighted potential threats to competition in the £7.5 billion (GBP1 = USD1.2139) market.

Ofcom's investigation identified challenges faced by businesses attempting to switch suppliers in the cloud services market, which serves as a critical infrastructure for online services. The regulator voiced concerns over 'hyperscalers' Amazon and Microsoft, who held a combined market share of 70-80% in 2022. High egress fees, technical barriers to interoperability and portability, and committed spend discounts were among the issues flagged by Ofcom's Fergal Farragher.

In response to these findings, Ofcom referred the sector to the CMA. Sarah Cardell emphasized the market's pivotal role in the UK economy and underscored the necessity for interventions to prevent power concentration. The focus of the CMA probe will be to assess potential adverse effects on competition and ensure maximum benefits through robust competition.

This development comes amidst other global economic events including a bounce back of Asia-Pacific shares after a bond sell-off. In addition, UK long-term borrowing costs have reached a 25-year high while US private sector jobless claims have seen a slight increase.

""We've made the difficult decision to close Amp. We learned a lot about how live music communities interact in the process, which we are bringing to bear as we build new fan experiences at scale in Amazon Music,"" an Amazon spokesperson was quoted as saying.

The service debuted in March 2022, amid a frenzy surrounding the audio-only social app Clubhouse and as firms like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Spotify, and X (formerly Twitter), put out live audio features.

Amazon has signed up big-name artists like Nicki Minaj, Lil Yachty, and Pusha T to host their own Amp shows, according to the report.

The move to shut down the service comes at a time when Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has undertaken a sweeping review of the company's expenses in response to slowing sales and an economic downturn.

In April, Amazon shut down its UK-based online bookstore 'Book Depository', which it acquired in 2011.

According to 'The Guardian', this comes after Amazon announced it had decided to 'eliminate' a number of positions across its Devices and Books businesses.

Stuart Felton and Andrew Crawford, former Amazon employees, founded Book Depository in 2004 with the mantra of selling 'less of more' rather than 'more of less'.

The move is seen as a strategic initiative to enhance user value, differentiate the company from competitors, reduce customer churn, and boost pricing power.

The new service includes 70% of The New York Times bestseller list and is expected to increase user engagement and gross margins, according to Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ). A high-end subscription tier aims to augment revenue, positioning Spotify against tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Following the announcement on Wednesday, Spotify's shares increased by 2.5%, trading at $157.37, 1.85% higher than before. According to InvestingPro Data, Spotify's market cap stands at 31.04B USD and it has a P/E ratio of -30.32. Despite a recent downgrade from Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Spotify's shares have surged by 93% year-to-date. This aligns with one of the InvestingPro Tips which highlights a high return over the last year for Spotify.

Analyst Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley maintains an Overweight rating on Spotify's shares with a $185 price target. He believes that leveraging its global streaming leadership and a user base of over 500 million monthly active users (MAUs), Spotify is poised to impact the $5 billion audiobook market within the larger $140 billion global book market.

Benchmark’s Mark Zgutowicz sees this move as a progression towards a fully-loaded subscription offering with Netflix-like annual pricing increases. This diversification strategy follows Spotify's podcasting venture in 2020. However, it's worth noting that according to InvestingPro Tips, the company's revenue growth has been slowing down recently, and it's not expected to be profitable this year.

The impact on Spotify's 2022 gross margin due to the introduction of this service was already incorporated into its guidance for this year and long-term plans. The company also plans to extend this feature to Family and Duo plan managers with purchasable 10-hour top-ups, and to future U.S. users. InvestingPro's data shows that the company's gross profit margin stands at 25.26%, and its revenue for the last twelve months was 13554.12M USD.

Despite paying $44 billion for Twitter (now X) last year, he has maintained his wealth. This has been helped by a five-fold increase in the value of his rocket company SpaceX, which is now worth $150 billion after four years.

Nine of the top 20 are worth $100 billion or more, the most ever, and up from just four last year.

While Ellison ranked three with an estimated fortune of $158 billion, Forbes said that no one in America has become wealthier this year than him, who is $57 billion richer because of the generative AI craze boosting shares of his software company.

Google (NASDAQ: )'s co-founder Larry Page, who ranked fifth, got $21 billion richer this year due to a 26 per cent jump in the shares of its parent company Alphabet. His wealth is now estimated at $114 billion.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder Bill Gates, who was once the world's richest man, now sits at the sixth spot on America's list with an estimated fortune of $111 billion, while Page's Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, comes in at number seven with a fortune of $110 billion.

According to the report by Redseer Strategy Consultants, there is likely to bea 6 to 8-fold growth in 3PL shipments between 2022 and 2030 -- from 2 billion in 2022 to an estimated 13-17 billion in 2030.

The greater adoption of e-commerce in Tier-2 and beyond cities, increasing ‘mass’ consumers, along with increased 3PL serviceability is propelling shipment volumes.

As a result, shipment volumes are expected to grow disproportionately relative to gross merchandise value (GMV) growth, said the report.

“3PL has emerged as an indispensable enabler for mass-focused horizontals, large verticals and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands. Collaborating with 3PL for logistics requirements expedites market entry, drives growth, and addresses the challenges of lumpy demand, thereby optimizing logistics investments per shipped unit,” explained Mohit Rana, partner at Redseer.

As the 3PL scales, the cost per shipment is projected to decrease by 23 per cent, dropping from Rs 60 in 2022 to Rs 47 by 2030.

Basis the average share of the eCommerce 3PL shipments in January-August 2022, Meesho emerged as the largest eCommerce 3PL shipment contributor in the country, with Flipkart, Ajio, and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) as the others among the top 4 players, according to the report.

2022-10-04, IANS,Amazon used a secret algorithm to raise prices: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-used-a-secret-algorithm-to-raise-prices-report-3835160,"San Francisco, Oct 4 (IANS) E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reportedly deployed a secret algorithm to gauge how much it could raise prices on its platform which allegedly helped the company increase its profits.The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday, citing redacted portions of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) monopoly lawsuit against the e-commerce major, that Amazon used the ‘Project Nessie’ algorithm to raise prices in a way that competitors would follow.

If the competing retailers maintained the lower price, the algorithm would automatically revert Amazon’s to its normal price, the report mentioned.

The ‘Project Nessie’ allegedly helped Amazon increase its profits by artificially increasing its prices across different shopping categories.

The company reportedly stopped using the secret algorithm in 2019.

“We once again call on Amazon to move swiftly to remove the redactions and allow the American public to see the full scope of what we allege are their illegal monopolistic practices,” an FTC spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Lina Khan-led Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 state Attorneys General in the US last month sued Amazon, alleging that the online retail and technology company is a monopolist that uses a set of interlocking anti-competitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power.

The FTC and its state partners said that Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

""Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,"" said FTC Chair Khan.

""The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them,"" she added.

The initiative debuted at Chicago's United Center on Friday. This collaboration comes as the Global X FinTech ETF (NASDAQ:FINX) has seen a nearly 50% decline over the past three years, creating a stock-picker's market within the sector.

Despite the industry-wide slump, Shift4 has reported robust growth in payment volume. In Q2 2022, the company noted a 59% YoY increase and a 487% rise since Q2 2019. This growth is largely due to a strategic shift in the company's business model. Previously focusing primarily on serving restaurants, Shift4 has now begun signing contracts with larger venues such as resorts and casinos.

The partnership with Amazon is designed to enhance customer experience through checkout-free shopping rather than directly increasing revenue. However, Shift4's profitability has been outpacing its revenue growth, suggesting a successful transition in strategy.

Looking ahead, Shift4 plans further expansion through ticketing services for large venues and cross-border payments. This follows its acquisition of Finaro, indicating an ambitious growth trajectory despite the challenging conditions in the fintech sector.

Netflix’s slower growth in India is primarily owing to the lack of local content, TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing analysts at global asset management firm AllianceBernstein.

The analysts reportedly said that only ""12 per cent of the titles"" Netflix offers in India were local content.

In comparison, nearly 60 per cent of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video’s offerings were in domestic languages in the country. Prime Video has about 2 crore subscribers in India and Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers, said the report.

""Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video,"" write the analysts.

""India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,"" they added in a note.

Netflix was yet to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, a significant price reduction in subscription tiers in India helped Netflix grow engagement in the country by nearly 30 per cent (year on year) in the first quarter of 2022. Over time, Netflix has adapted our prices to meet local needs and to further deepen its penetration, it lowered prices in India by 20-60 per cent.

""These reductions -- combined with an improved slate -- helped grow engagement in India by nearly 30 per cent year on year while F/X neutral revenue growth in 2022 accelerated to 24 per cent (versus 19 per cent in 2021),"" the company said in its quarter earnings report.

Streaming giant Netflix is reportedly planning to increase the price of its streaming service again -- starting with the US and Canada first -- to make up for the revenue lost during the Hollywood strike, a media report said.

Learning from the success in India, Netflix reduced prices in an additional 116 countries in Q1. Streaming giant Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

Notably, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), who together control between 70% and 80% of Britain's sector, will be under special scrutiny.

The probe will focus on various aspects such as egress fees, discounts, and technical barriers that may prevent customers from switching providers. In addition, the software licensing practices of certain providers, specifically Microsoft, will also be examined.

This investigation forms part of a broader initiative by the CMA under its upcoming Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Bill. This initiative was outlined in its 2022 to 2024 Annual Plan.

The conclusions drawn from this investigation are expected to be published on the Cloud Services Market Investigation case page by April 2025. The CMA inquiry group is expected to release a statement soon outlining proposed focus areas for this crucial investigation.

2022-10-05, Investing.com,Amazon and Microsoft face UK cloud market investigation,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-and-microsoft-face-uk-cloud-market-investigation-93CH-3837671,"The UK's £7.5 billion public cloud infrastructure services market is under investigation, with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), two major players in the sector, being the primary targets. The probe, initiated by Ofcom and now escalated to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), is set to examine the firms' dominance in the market, which represented 70-80% of the UK's supply by revenue in 2022.

On Thursday, Ofcom referred the matter to the CMA, led by Sarah Cardell. The regulatory body raised concerns over practices such as discounts incentivizing single provider use, technical barriers to switching providers, and charges for data migration. The CMA's independent inquiry group will scrutinize these issues further and propose any necessary actions. The investigation is expected to wrap up by April 2025.

The escalation of the investigation comes amid concerns over anti-competitive behaviors like egress fees, interoperability restrictions, and committed spend discounts. While Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud's Amit Zavery has voiced support for Ofcom's stance against vendor lock-in, AWS has countered Ofcom's findings.

AWS criticized Ofcom's approach as a ""fundamental misconception"" of the IT sector. The company warned that the investigation could lead to ""unintended harm to IT customers"" while emphasizing its commitment to promoting ""robust competition among IT providers"".

Dominated by 'hyperscalers' Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Google (NASDAQ: ), these companies are now under scrutiny by regulatory bodies for practices that could harm competition and impact the UK economy.

The investigation was initiated by Ofcom under the Enterprise Act 2002 and is led by Fergal Farragher. The study reveals practices such as high egress fees, technical barriers to data portability, and committed spend discounts. These practices could potentially limit competitors from effectively challenging the market leaders due to the high profitability of AWS and Microsoft and the difficulty in customer switching.

Industries such as telecommunications, broadcasting, and public services that heavily rely on cloud computing could be impacted by these practices. Acknowledging the potential implications on the UK's digital economy, Ofcom has referred these concerns to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for a more detailed investigation.

The CMA investigation, led by Sarah Cardell, echoes similar probes into public sector cloud services in the EU. The responses from AWS and Microsoft to the findings have varied. While Microsoft has pledged commitment to competition, AWS disputed the findings and claimed no separate fees for switching providers.

These investigations underscore the essential role of cloud services in businesses and potential competitive harm. The outcome of this probe will decide whether action should be taken against these dominant players in the market.

Further, it is interesting to see that 20 per cent of the respondents prefer switching to online platforms from offline modes, with the top reason for 43 per cent of this segment being the availability of the latest devices,” said Research Director Tarun Pathak.

In its market study, Ofcom identified a number of features in the supply of cloud services that make it more difficult for customers to switch and use multiple cloud suppliers.

Ofcom has estimated that the market for cloud services in the UK was worth up to 7.5 billion pounds in 2022.

“We welcome Ofcom’s referral of public cloud infrastructure services to us for in-depth scrutiny. This is a 7.5 billion pounds market that underpins a whole host of online services -- from social media to AI foundation models,” said Sarah Cardell, CEO of the CMA.

The features which Ofcom is most concerned about are charges that cloud customers must pay to move their data out of the cloud.

The media regulator is also concerned about discounts which may incentivise customers to use only one cloud provider and technical barriers to switching, which may prevent customers from being able to switch between different clouds or use more than one provider.

The Ofcom study found that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft had a combined market share of supply by revenue in the UK public cloud infrastructure services market of 70-80 per cent in 2022.

“The CMA’s independent inquiry group will now carry out an investigation to determine whether competition in this market is working well and if not, what action should be taken to address any issues it finds,” said Cardell.

The CMA has appointed independent panel members to an inquiry group, who will act as the decision makers on this investigation.

The CMA will conclude its investigation by April 2025.

The probe, led by CMA CEO Sarah Cardell, was sparked on Thursday, following a year-long investigation by Ofcom that highlighted potential threats to competition in the £7.5 billion (GBP1 = USD1.2139) market.

Ofcom's investigation identified challenges faced by businesses attempting to switch suppliers in the cloud services market, which serves as a critical infrastructure for online services. The regulator voiced concerns over 'hyperscalers' Amazon and Microsoft, who held a combined market share of 70-80% in 2022.

In response to these findings, Ofcom referred the sector to the CMA. Sarah Cardell emphasized the market's pivotal role in the UK economy and underscored the necessity for interventions to prevent power concentration. The focus of the CMA probe will be to assess potential adverse effects on competition and ensure maximum benefits through robust competition.

The move is seen as a strategic initiative to enhance user value, differentiate the company from competitors, reduce customer churn, and boost pricing power.

The new service includes 70% of The New York Times bestseller list and is expected to increase user engagement and gross margins, according to Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ). A high-end subscription tier aims to augment revenue, positioning Spotify against tech giants like Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).

Following the announcement on Wednesday, Spotify's shares increased by 2.5%, trading at $157.37, 1.85% higher than before. According to InvestingPro Data, Spotify's market cap stands at 31.04B USD and it has a P/E ratio of -30.32.

The impact on Spotify's 2022 gross margin due to the introduction of this service was already incorporated into its guidance for this year and long-term plans. The company also plans to extend this feature to Family and Duo plan managers with purchasable 10-hour top-ups, and to future U.S. users.

Despite paying $44 billion for Twitter (now X) last year, he has maintained his wealth. This has been helped by a five-fold increase in the value of his rocket company SpaceX, which is now worth $150 billion after four years.

Nine of the top 20 are worth $100 billion or more, the most ever, and up from just four last year.

While Ellison ranked three with an estimated fortune of $158 billion, Forbes said that no one in America has become wealthier this year than him, who is $57 billion richer because of the generative AI craze boosting shares of his software company.

Google (NASDAQ: )'s co-founder Larry Page, who ranked fifth, got $21 billion richer this year due to a 26 per cent jump in the shares of its parent company Alphabet. His wealth is now estimated at $114 billion.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder Bill Gates, who was once the world's richest man, now sits at the sixth spot on America's list with an estimated fortune of $111 billion, while Page's Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, comes in at number seven with a fortune of $110 billion.

According to the report by Redseer Strategy Consultants, there is likely to bea 6 to 8-fold growth in 3PL shipments between 2022 and 2030 -- from 2 billion in 2022 to an estimated 13-17 billion in 2030.

The greater adoption of e-commerce in Tier-2 and beyond cities, increasing ‘mass’ consumers, along with increased 3PL serviceability is propelling shipment volumes.

As a result, shipment volumes are expected to grow disproportionately relative to gross merchandise value (GMV) growth, said the report.

“3PL has emerged as an indispensable enabler for mass-focused horizontals, large verticals and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) brands. Collaborating with 3PL for logistics requirements expedites market entry, drives growth, and addresses the challenges of lumpy demand, thereby optimizing logistics investments per shipped unit,” explained Mohit Rana, partner at Redseer.

As the 3PL scales, the cost per shipment is projected to decrease by 23 per cent, dropping from Rs 60 in 2022 to Rs 47 by 2030.

If the competing retailers maintained the lower price, the algorithm would automatically revert Amazon’s to its normal price, the report mentioned.

The ‘Project Nessie’ allegedly helped Amazon increase its profits by artificially increasing its prices across different shopping categories.

The company reportedly stopped using the secret algorithm in 2019.

“We once again call on Amazon to move swiftly to remove the redactions and allow the American public to see the full scope of what we allege are their illegal monopolistic practices,” an FTC spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Lina Khan-led Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 state Attorneys General in the US last month sued Amazon, alleging that the online retail and technology company is a monopolist that uses a set of interlocking anti-competitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power.

The FTC and its state partners said that Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

""Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,"" said FTC Chair Khan.

""The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them,"" she added.

Despite a challenging year marked by rising interest rates and growing concerns about Federal Reserve policy, these tech giants have demonstrated resilience. Notably, shares of Nvidia have more than tripled since the beginning of the year, while Meta Platforms and Tesla shares have more than doubled. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google shares have risen roughly 50%, with Apple and Microsoft up more than a third.

This performance contrasts with last year's bear market when tech stocks led the declines. However, thanks to consistent earnings growth and the artificial intelligence revolution, tech stocks have become some of the market's biggest gainers this year, despite soaring interest rates.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their research note that the divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors. They anticipate an additional boost for these tech giants during the Q3 earnings period, as profit upgrades are expected to outnumber downgrades.

Despite this optimistic outlook, not all analysts share Goldman Sachs' bullish stance. RBC Capital expects weakness in US stocks to continue, citing data from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed a steep drop in net bullishness since mid-August.

Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs remains confident about the prospects of the US stock market. The firm now expects the S&P 500 to end 2022 at around 4,500 points, implying a potential upside of approximately 5% compared to current levels. This optimistic forecast is partly driven by expectations of falling Treasury yields, which could provide a boost to these mega-cap tech stocks.

The bank believes that the introduction of video ads within Prime Video content will unlock substantial revenues and boost margins significantly.

UBS estimates that Prime Video ads in the U.S. alone could generate $6.2 billion in incremental revenue and increase earnings per share by $0.40 over time, potentially adding around 1.2% to North America retail margins.

Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists and rates strategists anticipate that yields will decrease to 4.3% in the fourth quarter but will reach a peak of 4.6% in the first half of 2024, eventually settling back to 4.3% by the end of that year. If yields remain contained in 2024 at these levels, it would imply that most of the de-rating has already occurred.

""The divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors: On a growth-adjusted basis, the mega caps trade at the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock in over six years,"" the strategists commented.

Further, historical patterns indicate that the upcoming third-quarter results could potentially trigger a shift in momentum for the largest tech stocks.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Rising content costs pressure streaming services to increase prices,https://in.investing.com/news/rising-content-costs-pressure-streaming-services-to-increase-prices-93CH-3832205,"Monday saw the rise of discontent among consumers due to the increasing prices of streaming services, with further price hikes anticipated. Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) recently raised the price of its Prime Instant Video service, adding ad breaks while offering users the option to pay more for an ad-free experience. Other media companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), are expected to follow this trend.

The Writers Guild of America secured an agreement earlier this week with studios to address concerns around compensation from streaming and the impact of artificial intelligence on their jobs. This significant victory for the writers signifies an impending increase in costs for studios and streaming services.

Simultaneously, sports rights fees, a key differentiator for many media companies' streaming services, are projected to rise from $19.8 billion in 2022 to $31.6 billion in 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts. As pay-TV distributors seem less willing to pay for sports networks, the cost of content continues to climb, putting pressure on media companies caught in a Catch-22 situation as consumers demand more high-quality content.

To keep pricing low, streaming services have introduced ad-supported tiers. While ad-free tier prices have increased, ad-supported tiers have largely remained the same. These tiers offer high long-term potential as they allow management to stabilize prices while increasing revenue per user by adjusting ad prices, user streaming minutes, or ads per minute of content.

However, ad prices dipped in 2022, with Netflix agreeing to lower prices with some advertisers in July and ad-supported streamers reducing their ad prices by 5% to 10% at this summer's Upfronts according to a Digiday report. These lower ad prices are exerting additional pressure on streamers' profits.

Investors have been urging media companies since last year to curb the losses incurred by their streaming services. With breakeven projections set for next year, price increases are seen as the quickest way to boost revenue without escalating costs. However, this may lead to customer cancellations and difficulties in acquiring new customers in a market already grappling with significant subscriber churn.

Streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix, which offer differentiated services, are expected to thrive despite these challenges. Amazon benefits from its Prime ecosystem, including its fast shipping service, while Netflix's wide-ranging content and superior technology appeal to a broad global audience.

However, smaller streaming companies might struggle and will need to find better ways to retain customers, possibly through bundling or reverting to more licensing revenue over direct-to-consumer approaches. For investors interested in streaming, the pricing power of a media company's streaming service is a crucial factor in their investment decision. Despite the challenges, Netflix remains one of the most appealing streaming service stocks as it manages costs and capitalizes on scale.

2022-10-01, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3831542,"Investing.com -- With an eleventh-hour deal reached to avert a U.S. government shutdown investors will be focusing on U.S. jobs data and speeches by Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in the week ahead. Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Meta AI wows analysts, Micron forecasts a big loss, Amazon is sued by the FTC, Apple dealing with scorching iPhone temps.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Analysts cheered by Meta's freshest AI innovations

Wall Street analysts are positive on Meta (NASDAQ: ) after the company unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) features and showcased its latest range of head-worn devices at its annual “Connect” developers conference this past week.

The new products include AI-enabled Ray-Ban smart glasses that can livestream what a user is seeing directly to Facebook and Instagram, as well as a newly updated virtual-reality headset. The company also presented a new AI chatbot and a studio for developers to create brand-specific chatbots.

Analysts are particularly optimistic about the AI potential.

Oppenheimer wrote that the updates show that the company ""understands investors want more focus on AI vs. the Metaverse,"" reiterating its Outperform rating on the company, and Evercore analysts said of the smart glasses: ""All in, this is a solid update, and we believe an important step towards mass adoption of AR/VR technology.""

UBS said it was ""positively surprised by the level of innovation going on at Meta, the series of products likely to boost engagement, and a clear path to medium-term monetization potential of genAI products.""

And Bank of America (NYSE: ) said the event ""offered early signs on how Meta will use AI to help drive user engagement (chat and image creation) and new business services,"" adding, ""We expect a number of AI based advertiser tools to help with ad creation and campaign management as well.”

Meta shares gained 1.6% for the week to $300.21.

Amazon accused of wielding 'monopoly power' by FTC in new antitrust lawsuit; invests in ChatGPT rival

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) took a fall Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant, but some analysts have maintained their positive outlook on the company.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of the lawsuit.

CFRA likewise maintained its Buy rating on Amazon and said it believes the lawsuit ""will be a lengthy and uphill battle for the FTC."" Along with Wedbush, it believes major structural changes in the company are unlikely. Wedbush added, ""Consistent with our view ahead of the lawsuit’s filing, we would be buyers of the pullback in shares.""

Amazon ultimately recovered some of its Tuesday losses and ended down 1.8% for the week to $127.12.

Separately, Amazon also announced in the past week that it is aiming to invest up to $4B in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, rival to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, aiming to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon says an initial investment of $1.25B could expand to $4B depending on certain conditions. Anthropic will then have access to Amazon's cloud computing platform to help optimize its AI systems, known as large language models.





Micron loses ground on shaky outlook

Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported Wednesday better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter , but a mixed picture on the outlook for the first quarter amid a challenging backdrop as the chip supply glut continued to keep a lid on demand.

Micron reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 a share, $0.08 better than anticipated, on above-par revenue of $4.01 billion.

For the fiscal first quarter, however, the company guided for a loss in a range of $1 to $1.14 a share versus consensus for $0.92 in the red, and revenue of $4.2B to $4.6B that comes in well below the $4.22B consensus.

JPMorgan raised the price target by $5 to $80 per share on MU, maintaining its Overweight rating, citing the beginning of an ""upturn"" in the memory industry and saying it believes Micron shares will rise through the rest of the year and into next ""as the market continues to discount improving revenue/pricing/margin/earnings power.""

Goldman Sachs commented in a similar manner:

""Despite what now appears to be a slower than previously expected recovery in gross margins and EPS, our constructive thesis on the stock predicated on improving demand and supply discipline (i.e. reduction in Wafer Fab Equipment spending and wafer starts) remains unchanged and, as such, we would view any pullback in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.""

Shares lost 4.4% on Thursday after the report, but clawed back those losses on Friday and ended down just fractionally for the week to $68.03.

Apple iPhones overheating: report

The new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The concerns, which echo similar ones for iPhone14 Pro, have been raised in consumer social media posts as well as reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ - the latter of which showed the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging, and up to 112 degrees (44C), when charging coincides with processor-intensive activities such as gaming.

Apple may need to address these overheating issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

Companies like Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) and Maplebear 's Instacart (NASDAQ: ) have faced difficulties in maintaining their initial stock price surges due to investor caution. Despite raising $18 billion this year, a significant drop from $300 billion in 2021, these companies are grappling with the current financial conditions.

The influence of smartphones on Arm's revenue was highlighted as a significant factor in their performance.

Instacart's projected full-year revenue stands at $2.95 billion. The company, like many others in the industry, is navigating through this downturn in IPO activity, which is largely driven by macroeconomic factors beyond individual company control. The analysts' insights underscore the complex interplay of factors affecting the IPO market currently.

""The divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors: On a growth-adjusted basis, the mega caps trade at the largest discount to the median S&P 500 stock in over six years,"" the strategists commented.

Further, historical patterns indicate that the upcoming third-quarter results could potentially trigger a shift in momentum for the largest tech stocks. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, these mega-cap stocks have exceeded consensus sales growth expectations in 81% of instances and have outperformed during about two-thirds of earnings seasons, typically by a margin of 3 percentage points."

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Rising content costs pressure streaming services to increase prices,https://in.investing.com/news/rising-content-costs-pressure-streaming-services-to-increase-prices-93CH-3832205,"Monday saw the rise of discontent among consumers due to the increasing prices of streaming services, with further price hikes anticipated. Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) recently raised the price of its Prime Instant Video service, adding ad breaks while offering users the option to pay more for an ad-free experience. Other media companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), are expected to follow this trend.

The Writers Guild of America secured an agreement earlier this week with studios to address concerns around compensation from streaming and the impact of artificial intelligence on their jobs. This significant victory for the writers signifies an impending increase in costs for studios and streaming services.

Simultaneously, sports rights fees, a key differentiator for many media companies' streaming services, are projected to rise from $19.8 billion in 2022 to $31.6 billion in 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts. As pay-TV distributors seem less willing to pay for sports networks, the cost of content continues to climb, putting pressure on media companies caught in a Catch-22 situation as consumers demand more high-quality content.

To keep pricing low, streaming services have introduced ad-supported tiers. While ad-free tier prices have increased, ad-supported tiers have largely remained the same. These tiers offer high long-term potential as they allow management to stabilize prices while increasing revenue per user by adjusting ad prices, user streaming minutes, or ads per minute of content.

However, ad prices dipped in 2022, with Netflix agreeing to lower prices with some advertisers in July and ad-supported streamers reducing their ad prices by 5% to 10% at this summer's Upfronts according to a Digiday report. These lower ad prices are exerting additional pressure on streamers' profits.

Investors have been urging media companies since last year to curb the losses incurred by their streaming services. With breakeven projections set for next year, price increases are seen as the quickest way to boost revenue without escalating costs. However, this may lead to customer cancellations and difficulties in acquiring new customers in a market already grappling with significant subscriber churn.

Streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix, which offer differentiated services, are expected to thrive despite these challenges. Amazon benefits from its Prime ecosystem, including its fast shipping service, while Netflix's wide-ranging content and superior technology appeal to a broad global audience.

However, smaller streaming companies might struggle and will need to find better ways to retain customers, possibly through bundling or reverting to more licensing revenue over direct-to-consumer approaches. For investors interested in streaming, the pricing power of a media company's streaming service is a crucial factor in their investment decision. Despite the challenges, Netflix remains one of the most appealing streaming service stocks as it manages costs and capitalizes on scale.

2022-10-01, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3831542,"Investing.com -- With an eleventh-hour deal reached to avert a U.S. government shutdown investors will be focusing on U.S. jobs data and speeches by Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in the week ahead. Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Meta AI wows analysts, Micron forecasts a big loss, Amazon is sued by the FTC, Apple dealing with scorching iPhone temps.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Analysts cheered by Meta's freshest AI innovations

Wall Street analysts are positive on Meta (NASDAQ: ) after the company unveiled new artificial intelligence (AI) features and showcased its latest range of head-worn devices at its annual “Connect” developers conference this past week.

The new products include AI-enabled Ray-Ban smart glasses that can livestream what a user is seeing directly to Facebook and Instagram, as well as a newly updated virtual-reality headset. The company also presented a new AI chatbot and a studio for developers to create brand-specific chatbots.

Analysts are particularly optimistic about the AI potential.

Oppenheimer wrote that the updates show that the company ""understands investors want more focus on AI vs. the Metaverse,"" reiterating its Outperform rating on the company, and Evercore analysts said of the smart glasses: ""All in, this is a solid update, and we believe an important step towards mass adoption of AR/VR technology.""

UBS said it was ""positively surprised by the level of innovation going on at Meta, the series of products likely to boost engagement, and a clear path to medium-term monetization potential of genAI products.""

And Bank of America (NYSE: ) said the event ""offered early signs on how Meta will use AI to help drive user engagement (chat and image creation) and new business services,"" adding, ""We expect a number of AI based advertiser tools to help with ad creation and campaign management as well.”

Meta shares gained 1.6% for the week to $300.21.

Amazon accused of wielding 'monopoly power' by FTC in new antitrust lawsuit; invests in ChatGPT rival

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) took a fall Tuesday after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission launched a landmark anti-trust lawsuit against the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant, but some analysts have maintained their positive outlook on the company.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of the lawsuit.

CFRA likewise maintained its Buy rating on Amazon and said it believes the lawsuit ""will be a lengthy and uphill battle for the FTC."" Along with Wedbush, it believes major structural changes in the company are unlikely. Wedbush added, ""Consistent with our view ahead of the lawsuit’s filing, we would be buyers of the pullback in shares.""

Amazon ultimately recovered some of its Tuesday losses and ended down 1.8% for the week to $127.12.

Separately, Amazon also announced in the past week that it is aiming to invest up to $4B in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, rival to ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, aiming to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology.

Under the terms of the agreement, Amazon says an initial investment of $1.25B could expand to $4B depending on certain conditions. Anthropic will then have access to Amazon's cloud computing platform to help optimize its AI systems, known as large language models.





Micron loses ground on shaky outlook

Micron (NASDAQ: ) reported Wednesday better-than-feared fiscal fourth-quarter , but a mixed picture on the outlook for the first quarter amid a challenging backdrop as the chip supply glut continued to keep a lid on demand.

Micron reported an adjusted loss of $1.07 a share, $0.08 better than anticipated, on above-par revenue of $4.01 billion.

For the fiscal first quarter, however, the company guided for a loss in a range of $1 to $1.14 a share versus consensus for $0.92 in the red, and revenue of $4.2B to $4.6B that comes in well below the $4.22B consensus.

JPMorgan raised the price target by $5 to $80 per share on MU, maintaining its Overweight rating, citing the beginning of an ""upturn"" in the memory industry and saying it believes Micron shares will rise through the rest of the year and into next ""as the market continues to discount improving revenue/pricing/margin/earnings power.""

Goldman Sachs commented in a similar manner:

""Despite what now appears to be a slower than previously expected recovery in gross margins and EPS, our constructive thesis on the stock predicated on improving demand and supply discipline (i.e. reduction in Wafer Fab Equipment spending and wafer starts) remains unchanged and, as such, we would view any pullback in the stock as an opportunity to add to positions.""

Shares lost 4.4% on Thursday after the report, but clawed back those losses on Friday and ended down just fractionally for the week to $68.03.

Apple iPhones overheating: report

The new Apple (NASDAQ: ) iPhone 15, particularly the high-end models, is facing overheating issues, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

The concerns, which echo similar ones for iPhone14 Pro, have been raised in consumer social media posts as well as reviews and tests conducted by the WSJ - the latter of which showed the iPhone 15 Pro Max reached temperatures as high as 106 degrees Fahrenheit (41C) while charging, and up to 112 degrees (44C), when charging coincides with processor-intensive activities such as gaming.

Apple may need to address these overheating issues through software updates, potentially impacting device performance.

Premium iPhones have traditionally been a significant source of revenue for Apple, especially as global smartphone demand has seen a decline. The company is pinning hopes on the iPhone 15, particularly its Pro variants, to rejuvenate its business and drive growth.

2022-10-01, IANS,"AI-generated ripoffs of original books being sold on Amazon, authors cry",https://in.investing.com/news/aigenerated-ripoffs-of-original-books-being-sold-on-amazon-authors-cry-3831397,"London, Oct 1 (IANS) Several authors have been left shocked after seeing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ripoffs of their books being sold on e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ). Writer-journalist Rory Cellan-Jones recently saw a memoir on Amazon he wrote with a ""naively designed cover by someone he had never heard of,"" reports The Guardian.

""I thought: 'This is strange -- who's writing a biography of me?'"" Cellan-Jones was quoted as saying.

It was revealed that his memoir had text apparently generated by AI, as ChatGPT has enabled people to generate pages of text without them writing those.

The biography and other titles by the pseudonymous author were removed by Amazon but ""plenty more get through the filters intended to weed out low-quality books,"" the report said.

Fifteen AI-generated books by someone known as 'Steven Walryn' were published in one day but removed by Amazon months later.

In August, author Jane Friedman, who writes about publishing, forced Amazon to remove five bogus titles in her name that were AI-generated.

""Amazon is clearly facing significant challenges with the influx of AI-generated products in its stores, and it appears to be playing catchup,"" Nicola Solomon, the chief executive of the Society of Authors (SoA), was quoted as saying in the report.

Authors such as Margaret Atwood, Viet Thanh Nguyen and Philip Pullman are also concerned their work is being used in large language models to train AI without their consent, compensation or credit.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company invests significant time and resources to ""ensure our guidelines are followed and remove books that do not adhere to them"".

""While we allow AI-generated content, we don't allow AI-generated content that violates our content guidelines, including content that creates a disappointing customer experience,"" the company added.

Last month, The Authors' Guild and 17 well-known authors like Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin, and Jodi Picoult filed a fresh lawsuit in the Southern district of New York against OpenAI.

According to the complaint, OpenAI ""copied plaintiffs' works wholesale, without permission or consideration"" and fed the copyrighted materials into large language models.

In the same month, authors Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, Rachel Louise Snyder and Ayelet Waldman alleged in a lawsuit that OpenAI benefits and profits from the ""unauthorised and illegal use"" of their copyrighted content.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,"Tech wreck temporary as earnings season, Fed cuts will spur rebound, Wedbush says",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-wreck-temporary-as-earnings-season-fed-cuts-will-spur-rebound-wedbush-says-3827167,"Investing.com – Tech stocks have suffered a bumpy ride in September as the road to higher rates for longer has rejuvenated the bears, but Wedbush argues, this weakness will prove to be a temporary joyride as the upcoming earnings season for big tech and fed cuts next year will trigger a rebound in growth across tech.

“Our bullish stance on tech is unchanged despite market fears,” Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, a tech bull, said in a note Wednesday, highlighting various positive factors for the industry including the growth of artificial intelligence, cloud, and a rebound in ad-spending.

Market 'obsession' with rates soon in rearview mirror as Fed cuts on horizon

Tech (NYSE: ), which is down about 5% over the past month, has been pressured by the hawkish Federal Reserve meeting earlier in September that has pushed Treasury yields to levels not seen since the global financial crisis in 2007. Rising rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

But the current rate scare, and the “obsession” with the will dissipate as the Federal Reserve cuts rates in 2024, leading to a soft a landing, Wedbush added.

The Fed's latest projections on the path of interest rates, released last week, showed the Fed members revised the number of rate cuts for next year to two from four previously. As well as the fewer rate cuts, the Fed maintained its outlook for another rate hike for this year, forcing markets to reprice in a higher for longer interest rate environment.

The fundamentals for tech, meanwhile, are yet to be priced in, Wedbush argues, pointing to “transformational growth” of artificial intelligence, cloud, cyber security, and rebound in the digital advertising market.

'Generational' AI growth set to drive tech spending

Wedbush believes the upcoming earnings season from big tech will not only be positive but also serve as “sneak peak” for what’s to come in 2024. Central to that theme, is AI, which will continue to spur a massive of wave of enterprise spending on hyperscale, or AI-related data center infrastructure – used to power AI models like ChatGPT – benefitting Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

""While this 3Q tech earnings cycle will not in itself turn the negative bearish sentiment away, we expect a positive earnings season for Big Tech which we view as a sneak preview for a major rebound in growth across the tech sector in 2024 with a soft landing backdrop,"" Wedbush added.

Wedbush is not alone in talking up the promise of AI. JPMorgan believes the AI hype is real and it’s here to stay.

“They’ve come off the boil since July, but there’s still a lot of optimism regarding AI’s impact on growth, profits and productivity,” {{0|JPMorgan said in its published outlook on Sept. 26, referring to the recent weakness in AI-related stocks."

2022-09-27, Investing.com,Amazon faces FTC lawsuit over monopolistic behavior allegations,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-faces-ftc-lawsuit-over-monopolistic-behavior-allegations-93CH-3826731,"In a significant development this Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), under the leadership of Lina Khan, is in a legal confrontation with e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ). The FTC has accused Amazon of monopolistic behavior and unfair strategies aimed at maintaining its dominance in the market.

Khan, known for her critical analysis of Amazon's business tactics in a Yale Law Journal paper, is now leading the charge against the company. This case echoes the government's past legal pursuit against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and could potentially bring about profound changes to Silicon Valley's competitive landscape.

Despite stepping down as CEO, Jeff Bezos continues to exert considerable influence as Amazon's executive chair and chief shareholder. The company currently boasts 1.5 million employees, 300 million customers, and a valuation of $1.3 trillion. According to InvestingPro, Amazon's market cap stands at an adjusted $1.28 trillion. It has also faced criticism in Wall Street Journal editorials.

The context of this lawsuit also brings into focus the historical significance of antitrust law during the Progressive Era and New Deal, as well as the current consumer welfare standard. It highlights Amazon's substantial lobbying efforts, with expenditures reaching up to $10 million. In terms of financial performance, InvestingPro data shows a revenue growth of 10.73% in the last twelve months leading up to the second quarter of 2022, indicating the company's accelerating income.

Khan's unique background as the daughter of Pakistani immigrants adds another layer to this story, emphasizing the diversity and changing face of leadership within regulatory bodies.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,Some analysts maintain Amazon ratings in the wake of landmark FTC lawsuit,https://in.investing.com/news/some-analysts-maintain-amazon-ratings-in-the-wake-of-landmark-ftc-lawsuit-3826347,"Investing.com -- Some analysts have kept their outlook for the future prospects of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) shares unchanged despite the $1.3 trillion e-commerce giant facing a landmark anti-trust lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

The FTC's long-awaited complaint alleges that Amazon is a monopoly that maintains its power by employing anticompetitive and unfair practices. In particular, the FTC accused the company of harnessing its dominant market position to fight efforts by sellers on its online marketplace to charge cheaper prices on rival platforms.

A federal court in Seattle, where Amazon is based, was asked by the FTC to consider ""any preliminary or permanent equitable relief, including but not limited to structural relief, necessary to restore fair competition.""

""Structural relief"" could refer to a possible splitting of Amazon into smaller parts, according to media reports. FTC Chair Lina Khan, who has long advocated for a sweeping crackdown on Big Tech firms, declined to discuss a possible break-up of Amazon in a press briefing on Tuesday. Instead, she said, the focus is on ""liability.""

Amazon General Counsel David Zapolsky, meanwhile, argued that the practices targeted by the FTC have actually produced ""greater selection, lower prices, and faster delivery speeds"" for customers and ""greater opportunity"" for businesses.

“The FTC’s complaint grossly mischaracterizes the retail industry and the dynamic competition that consumers benefit from every day,"" Zapolsky said in a blog post. ""Consumers today still buy over 80% of all retail products in physical stores. And as any shopper knows, you can buy the same products at any number of different retailers that compete vigorously with each other, including brick-and-mortar stores, online stores, and quickly growing hybrid models like buy-online-pick-up-in-store.""

Considering the case, analysts at Telsey Advisory Group said that while they ""understand"" the FTC is concerned about the costs Amazon extracts from sellers, they believe it could be ""hard to argue"" with the tech group's response that sellers have multiple options to transact. The analysts maintained their outperform rating of the stock, adding that they expect it to still be a ""share gainer.""

Analysts at Bank of America (NYSE: ) and Citi also reiterated their respective buy ratings, arguing that Amazon's core operations could help offset fears around the outcome of lawsuit."
2022-10-01, IANS,"AI-generated ripoffs of original books being sold on Amazon, authors cry",https://in.investing.com/news/aigenerated-ripoffs-of-original-books-being-sold-on-amazon-authors-cry-3831397,"London, Oct 1 (IANS) Several authors have been left shocked after seeing artificial intelligence (AI)-generated ripoffs of their books being sold on e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ). Writer-journalist Rory Cellan-Jones recently saw a memoir on Amazon he wrote with a ""naively designed cover by someone he had never heard of,"" reports The Guardian.

""I thought: 'This is strange -- who's writing a biography of me?'"" Cellan-Jones was quoted as saying.

It was revealed that his memoir had text apparently generated by AI, as ChatGPT has enabled people to generate pages of text without them writing those.

The biography and other titles by the pseudonymous author were removed by Amazon but ""plenty more get through the filters intended to weed out low-quality books,"" the report said.

Fifteen AI-generated books by someone known as 'Steven Walryn' were published in one day but removed by Amazon months later.

In August, author Jane Friedman, who writes about publishing, forced Amazon to remove five bogus titles in her name that were AI-generated.

""Amazon is clearly facing significant challenges with the influx of AI-generated products in its stores, and it appears to be playing catchup,"" Nicola Solomon, the chief executive of the Society of Authors (SoA), was quoted as saying in the report.

Authors such as Margaret Atwood, Viet Thanh Nguyen and Philip Pullman are also concerned their work is being used in large language models to train AI without their consent, compensation or credit.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the company invests significant time and resources to ""ensure our guidelines are followed and remove books that do not adhere to them"".

""While we allow AI-generated content, we don't allow AI-generated content that violates our content guidelines, including content that creates a disappointing customer experience,"" the company added.

Last month, The Authors' Guild and 17 well-known authors like Jonathan Franzen, John Grisham, George R.R. Martin, and Jodi Picoult filed a fresh lawsuit in the Southern district of New York against OpenAI.

According to the complaint, OpenAI ""copied plaintiffs' works wholesale, without permission or consideration"" and fed the copyrighted materials into large language models.

In the same month, authors Michael Chabon, David Henry Hwang, Rachel Louise Snyder and Ayelet Waldman alleged in a lawsuit that OpenAI benefits and profits from the ""unauthorised and illegal use"" of their copyrighted content.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,"Tech wreck temporary as earnings season, Fed cuts will spur rebound, Wedbush says",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-wreck-temporary-as-earnings-season-fed-cuts-will-spur-rebound-wedbush-says-3827167,"Investing.com – Tech stocks have suffered a bumpy ride in September as the road to higher rates for longer has rejuvenated the bears, but Wedbush argues, this weakness will prove to be a temporary joyride as the upcoming earnings season for big tech and fed cuts next year will trigger a rebound in growth across tech.

“Our bullish stance on tech is unchanged despite market fears,” Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, a tech bull, said in a note Wednesday, highlighting various positive factors for the industry including the growth of artificial intelligence, cloud, and a rebound in ad-spending.

Market 'obsession' with rates soon in rearview mirror as Fed cuts on horizon

Tech (NYSE: ), which is down about 5% over the past month, has been pressured by the hawkish Federal Reserve meeting earlier in September that has pushed Treasury yields to levels not seen since the global financial crisis in 2007. Rising rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

But the current rate scare, and the “obsession” with the will dissipate as the Federal Reserve cuts rates in 2024, leading to a soft a landing, Wedbush added.

The Fed's latest projections on the path of interest rates, released last week, showed the Fed members revised the number of rate cuts for next year to two from four previously. As well as the fewer rate cuts, the Fed maintained its outlook for another rate hike for this year, forcing markets to reprice in a higher for longer interest rate environment.

The fundamentals for tech, meanwhile, are yet to be priced in, Wedbush argues, pointing to “transformational growth” of artificial intelligence, cloud, cyber security, and rebound in the digital advertising market.

'Generational' AI growth set to drive tech spending

Wedbush believes the upcoming earnings season from big tech will not only be positive but also serve as “sneak peak” for what’s to come in 2024. Central to that theme, is AI, which will continue to spur a massive of wave of enterprise spending on hyperscale, or AI-related data center infrastructure – used to power AI models like ChatGPT – benefitting Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

""While this 3Q tech earnings cycle will not in itself turn the negative bearish sentiment away, we expect a positive earnings season for Big Tech which we view as a sneak preview for a major rebound in growth across the tech sector in 2024 with a soft landing backdrop,"" Wedbush added.

Wedbush is not alone in talking up the promise of AI. JPMorgan believes the AI hype is real and it’s here to stay.

“They’ve come off the boil since July, but there’s still a lot of optimism regarding AI’s impact on growth, profits and productivity,” {{0|JPMorgan said in its published outlook on Sept. 26, referring to the recent weakness in AI-related stocks."

The usage of the pay later option has grown by 50% in 2022 compared to last year.

Amazon's survey findings suggest positive customer sentiment ahead of the festive season. Over 80% of respondents intend to shop during this year's festive sales, and more than half plan to increase their spending. This is in line with Amazon's robust revenue growth of 10.73% in the last twelve months (LTM2022.Q2), as reported by InvestingPro. Furthermore, 80% of the Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card holders in Maharashtra have used their cards at least once in 2022.

The FTC has accused Amazon of monopolistic behavior and unfair strategies aimed at maintaining its dominance in the market.

Khan, known for her critical analysis of Amazon's business tactics in a Yale Law Journal paper, is now leading the charge against the company. This case echoes the government's past legal pursuit against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and could potentially bring about profound changes to Silicon Valley's competitive landscape.

The company currently boasts 1.5 million employees, 300 million customers, and a valuation of $1.3 trillion. According to InvestingPro, Amazon's market cap stands at an adjusted $1.28 trillion.

These strategies allegedly position the company as a dominant marketplace landlord, seller, and delivery business, thus creating an unfair competitive environment.

In response to the lawsuit, Amazon has defended its practices. The tech giant argues that its operational methods are designed to prevent higher prices for consumers and slower delivery times. This rebuttal suggests that without such practices in place, consumers could face increased costs and delayed deliveries.

The FTC's legal action against Amazon forms part of an ongoing examination of the company's market dominance. The outcome of this lawsuit could potentially reshape the dynamics of the e-commerce sector in the United States.

The case was brought to light on Tuesday, accusing the e-commerce giant of unlawfully dominating broad sections of online retail.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of implementing restrictive practices that have allegedly led to price hikes and negatively impacted consumer shopping experiences. Among these practices, Amazon is accused of prohibiting merchants on its platform from offering lower prices elsewhere. Furthermore, the company is alleged to force vendors to use its logistics service for deliveries if they wish their products to be included in the Prime subscription bundle.

The FTC and the 17 states involved in the lawsuit argue these practices have not only caused prices to increase but also worsened the overall shopping experience for consumers. The outcome of this case could potentially bring about significant changes in the way American consumers shop online, especially considering Amazon's substantial presence in the online retail sector.

This legal challenge represents a substantial governmental effort to regulate the online retail space, particularly focusing on alleged monopolistic practices. The impact of this lawsuit on Amazon's operations and policies will be closely watched by other players in the industry, as it could set a precedent for future regulatory actions.

The complaint alleged that Amazon violates the law not because it is big, but because it engages in a course of exclusionary conduct that prevents current competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging.

Amazon’s ongoing pattern of illegal conduct blocks competition, allowing it to wield monopoly power to inflate prices, degrade quality, and stifle innovation for consumers and businesses

The Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general today sued Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Inc. alleging that the online retail and technology company is a monopolist that uses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The FTC and its state partners say Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

The complaint alleges that Amazon violates the law not because it is big, but because it engages in a course of exclusionary conduct that prevents current competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging. By stifling competition on price, product selection, quality, and by preventing its current or future rivals from attracting a critical mass of shoppers and sellers, Amazon ensures that no current or future rival can threaten its dominance. Amazon’s far-reaching schemes impact hundreds of billions of dollars in retail sales every year, touch hundreds of thousands of products sold by businesses big and small and affect over a hundred million shoppers.

“Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them. Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Amazon to account for these monopolistic practices and restore the lost promise of free and fair competition.”

“We’re bringing this case because Amazon’s illegal conduct has stifled competition across a huge swath of the online economy. Amazon is a monopolist that uses its power to hike prices on American shoppers and charge sky-high fees on hundreds of thousands of online sellers,” said John Newman, Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Seldom in the history of U.S. antitrust law has one case had the potential to do so much good for so many people.”

The FTC and states allege Amazon’s anticompetitive conduct occurs in two markets—the online superstore market that serves shoppers and the market for online marketplace services purchased by sellers. These tactics include:

Anti-discounting measures that punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering prices lower than Amazon, keeping prices higher for products across the internet. For example, if Amazon discovers that a seller is offering lower-priced goods elsewhere, Amazon can bury discounting sellers so far down in Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible.

Conditioning sellers’ ability to obtain “Prime” eligibility for their products—a virtual necessity for doing business on Amazon—on sellers using Amazon’s costly fulfillment service, which has made it substantially more expensive for sellers on Amazon to also offer their products on other platforms. This unlawful coercion has in turn limited competitors’ ability to effectively compete against Amazon.

Amazon’s illegal, exclusionary conduct makes it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold. With its amassed power across both the online superstore market and online marketplace services market, Amazon extracts enormous monopoly rents from everyone within its reach. This includes:

Degrading the customer experience by replacing relevant, organic search results with paid advertisements—and deliberately increasing junk ads that worsen search quality and frustrate both shoppers seeking products and sellers who are promised a return on their advertising purchase.

Biasing Amazon’s search results to preference Amazon’s own products over ones that Amazon knows are of better quality.

Charging costly fees on the hundreds of thousands of sellers that currently have no choice but to rely on Amazon to stay in business. These fees range from a monthly fee sellers must pay for each item sold, to advertising fees that have become virtually necessary for sellers to do business. Combined, all of these fees force many sellers to pay close to 50% of their total revenues to Amazon. These fees harm not only sellers but also shoppers, who pay increased prices for thousands of products sold on or off Amazon.

The FTC, along with its state partners, are seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that would prohibit Amazon from engaging in its unlawful conduct and pry loose Amazon’s monopolistic control to restore competition.

Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin joined the Commission’s lawsuit. The Commission vote to authorize staff to file for a permanent injunction and other equitable relief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was 3-0.

NOTE: The Commission issues a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest."

2022-09-26, Investing.com,"U.S. futures dip, Moody's flags government shutdown impact - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-futures-dip-moodys-flags-government-shutdown-impact--whats-moving-markets-3824063,"Investing.com -- Stock futures inch down, hinting a possible reversal from a positive session on Monday, as Wall Street's main indices are on pace to post losses in September. Meanwhile, investors gauge developments in an ongoing budgetary stand-off in Washington, as Moody's (NYSE: ) warns that a potential government shutdown caused by the fight will be ""negative"" for the U.S.'s rating. Elsewhere, President Biden prepares to visit Michigan to show his backing for striking auto workers.

1. Stock futures edge lower

U.S. stock futures moved down on Tuesday, pointing to a pullback from gains in the previous session, with the major indices on Wall Street on track to end September lower.

At 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT), the contract shed 117 points or 0.3%, lost 18 points or 0.4%, and fell by 72 points or 0.5%.

Along with the fallout from the Federal Reserve's hawkish policy update last week, investors began the final trading week of the month eyeing an ongoing budgetary stand-off in Washington that threatens to culminate in a potential government shutdown.

On Monday, the benchmark , tech-heavy , and 30-stock climbed, snapping four-day losing streaks. Sentiment was supported by an uptick in shares in e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which announced plans to invest in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, adding more fuel to the hype around emerging AI technology.

But all of the indices are still on course to finish September in the red, with the S&P 500 in particular heading for its worst month since December.

2. U.S. House to consider spending bills as possible government shutdown looms

The U.S. House of Representatives is set to consider four conservative-backed spending bills for the upcoming fiscal year on Tuesday, although they are not widely expected to become law and may force a possible government shutdown as early as October 1.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a top Republican leader in Washington, has attempted to appease some members of his party by advancing the pieces of legislation, which include restrictions on abortion access and cuts to expenditures on climate initiatives. In return, McCarthy hopes to secure enough support from far-right GOP lawmakers to pass a stopgap funding bill that would temporarily avert a shutdown.

However, hardline Republicans, many of whom were displeased with a prior spending agreement forged by McCarthy and President Joe Biden earlier this year, have expressed reservations about backing a stopgap measure.

Moody's, a credit rating agency, warned on Monday that a shutdown would ""underscore the weakness"" of U.S. institutions and governance compared to other countries with a similar top-notch triple-A rating.

3. Biden to visit Michigan amid auto workers' strike

President Biden will head to Michigan on Tuesday, with the famously pro-union leader tipped to show his support for the United Auto Workers union's ongoing strike against Detroit carmakers.

Biden's visit comes as Ford Motor (NYSE: ) has flagged that ""significant gaps"" remain in its negotiations with the UAW despite recently improving its offer. Ford, along with General Motors (NYSE: ) and Jeep-manufacturer Stellantis (NYSE: ), have proposed pay rises, although the union has said differences remain around issues like pension benefits and working conditions.

The UAW's walkouts, which began on September 15 at assembly plants owned by these so-called Detroit Three firms, have led to tens of thousands of workers taking to the picket lines.

Biden, who is preparing to run for re-election next year, has yet to receive a formal endorsement from the UAW. He has called on car companies to ""go further"" to share corporate profits with the union's members.

Meanwhile, former president Donald Trump plans to hold a rally for auto workers in Detroit on Wednesday, as he attempts to regain the support of many blue-collar voters ahead of his own 2024 election bid.

4. Evergrande shares slip for second-straight day

Shares in China Evergrande Group (HK: ) slumped for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after the indebted developer announced that one its main domestic units had missed an onshore bond payment.

Evergrande's Hengda Real Estate Group announced in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing that it had not paid the principal and interest on a 4 billion yuan bond that was due by September 25.

Shares in Evergrande subsequently fell by 8.14%.

It marked the latest setback for Evergrande, the embattled property group that has been at the center of a real estate crisis weighing on the wider Chinese economy. On Monday, the company's stock tumbled by more than 20% after it announced that it was unable to issue new debt because of an investigation into Hengda.

5. Oil prices decline on fuel demand fears

Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, as traders gauged how fuel demand may be impacted by key central banks suggesting that they could keep interest rates higher for longer to combat inflation.

Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank both restated their commitment to corraling price gains, hinting that policy may remain tighter for a longer-than-anticipated period of time. Such a tactic would likely hit economic activity, which in turn could dampen oil demand.

Elsewhere, Evergrande's woes this week have renewed stress over economic growth in China -- the world's largest crude importer -- over the rest of the year.

Partly offsetting these demand concerns are supplies, which are still largely tight after Russia and Saudi Arabia extended output cuts until the end of 2022.

By 04:49 ET, the futures traded 1.1% lower at $88.74 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.0% to $90.95."

Panay is likely to run Amazon’s division for its Alexa and Echo speakers.

Blue Origin won a $3.4 billion NASA contract earlier this year to build a lunar lander for the US space agency’s astronauts.

Under Smith’s leadership, Blue Origin has grown to several billion dollars in sales orders, “with a substantial backlog for our vehicles and engines"", Bezos wrote in his email.

“Our team has increased from 850 people when Bob joined to more than 10,000 today. We’ve expanded from one office in Kent to building a launch pad at LC-36 and five million square feet of facilities across seven states,” he added.

Wall Street indices suffer weak month

The main indices on Wall Street look set to enter the final week of September on a negative note, with the indication from the U.S. central bank that interest rates will remain elevated for longer than expected weighing heavily.

The tech sector has been hardest hit, with the on track to slump 5.9% this month, potentially its biggest monthly loss since December. The broad-based is set to drop 4.2% this month, while the blue-chip has shed 2.2%.

Budget stand-off continues

Also weighing on sentiment is Congress' ongoing budget stand-off, with the federal government set to run out of funding for its operations at the start of October unless lawmakers can hammer out a deal.

Over the weekend, Democrats and Republicans in Congress both warned that there is a chance a deal will not be reached. Even a plan to create a 45-day extension to government funding to give legislators more time coming up against strong resistance by a handful of GOP holdouts in the House.

Washington's latest budgetary showdown comes only a few months after a battle over the U.S. debt limit almost brought the world's largest economy to the brink of a damaging default.

Amazon seeks to boost AI position

In corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said on Monday that it is aiming to invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, as the tech giant looks to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology. Amazon shares were up 1.1%.

Oil prices edged higher Monday, rebounding after their first negative week in four as traders returned their focus to the prospect of tighter supplies going forward.

Both contracts fell last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve stance raised concerns of a hit to economic activity and thus oil demand in the largest consumer in the world.

2022-09-25, Investing.com,Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in AI firm Anthropic for minority stake,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-ai-firm-anthropic-for-minority-stake-432SI-3822472,"Amazon (AMZN) and Anthropic today announced a strategic collaboration that will bring together their respective industry-leading technology and expertise in safer generative artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the development of Anthropic’s future foundation models and make them widely accessible to AWS customers. As part of the expanded collaboration:

Anthropic will use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS. The two companies will also collaborate in the development of future Trainium and Inferentia technology.

AWS will become Anthropic’s primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads, including safety research and future foundation model development. Anthropic plans to run the majority of its workloads on AWS, further providing Anthropic with the advanced technology of the world’s leading cloud provider.

Anthropic makes a long-term commitment to provide AWS customers around the world with access to future generations of its foundation models via Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed service that provides secure access to the industry’s top foundation models. In addition, Anthropic will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic and have a minority ownership position in the company.

Amazon developers and engineers will be able to build with Anthropic models via Amazon Bedrock so they can incorporate generative AI capabilities into their work, enhance existing applications, and create net-new customer experiences across Amazon’s businesses.

“We have tremendous respect for Anthropic’s team and foundation models, and believe we can help improve many customer experiences, short and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Customers are quite excited about Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s new managed service that enables companies to use various foundation models to build generative AI applications on top of, as well as AWS Trainium, AWS’s AI training chip, and our collaboration with Anthropic should help customers get even more value from these two capabilities.”

“We are excited to use AWS’s Trainium chips to develop future foundation models,” said Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic. “Since announcing our support of Amazon Bedrock in April, Claude has seen significant organic adoption from AWS customers. By significantly expanding our partnership, we can unlock new possibilities for organizations of all sizes, as they deploy Anthropic’s safe, state-of-the-art AI systems together with AWS’s leading cloud technology.”

An AWS customer since 2021, Anthropic has grown quickly into one of the world’s leading foundation model providers and a leading advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. Their foundation model, Claude, excels at a wide range of tasks, from sophisticated dialogue and creative content generation to complex reasoning and detailed instruction, while maintaining a high degree of reliability and predictability. Its industry-leading 100,000 token context window can securely process extensive amounts of information across all industries, from manufacturing and aerospace to agriculture and consumer goods, as well as technical, domain-specific documents for industries such as finance, legal, and healthcare. Customers report that Claude is much less likely to produce harmful outputs, easier to converse with, and more steerable compared to other foundation models, so developers can get their desired output with less effort. Anthropic’s state-of-the-art model, Claude 2, scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Today’s news is the latest AWS generative AI announcement as the company continues to expand its unique offering at all three layers of the generative AI stack. At the bottom layer, AWS continues to offer compute instances from NVIDIA as well as AWS’s own custom silicon chips, AWS Trainium for AI training and AWS Inferentia for AI inference. At the middle layer, AWS is focused on providing customers with the broadest selection of foundation models from multiple leading providers where customers can then customize those models, keep their own data private and secure, and seamlessly integrate with the rest of their AWS workloads—all of this is offered through AWS’s new service, Amazon Bedrock. With today’s announcement, customers will have early access to features for customizing Anthropic models, using their own proprietary data to create their own private models, and will be able to utilize fine-tuning capabilities via a self-service feature within Amazon Bedrock. At the top layer, AWS offers generative AI applications and services for customers like Amazon CodeWhisperer, a powerful AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code.

As part of this deeper collaboration, AWS and Anthropic are committing meaningful resources that are helping customers get started with Claude and Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, including through the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where teams of AI experts will help customers of all sizes to develop new generative AI-powered applications to transform their organizations.

Customers accessing Anthropic’s current models via Amazon Bedrock are building generative AI-powered applications that help automate tasks such as producing market forecasts, developing research reports, enabling new drug discovery for healthcare, and personalizing education programs. Enterprises already taking advantage of this advanced technology include Lonely Planet, a premier travel media company celebrated for its decades of travel content; Bridgewater Associates, a premier asset management firm for global institutional investors; and LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a top-tier global provider of information and analytics serving customers in more than 150 countries.

“We are developing a generative AI solution on AWS to help customers plan epic trips and create life-changing experiences with personalized travel itineraries,” said Chris Whyde, senior vice president of Engineering and Data Science at Lonely Planet. “By building with Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, we reduced itinerary generation costs by nearly 80 percent when we quickly created a scalable, secure AI platform that organizes our book content in minutes to deliver cohesive, highly accurate travel recommendations. Now we can re-package and personalize our content in various ways on our digital platforms, based on customer preference, all while highlighting trusted local voices–just like Lonely Planet has done for 50 years.”

“At Bridgewater, we believe the global economic machine can be understood, so we strive to build a fundamental, cause-and-effect understanding of markets and economies powered by cutting-edge technology,” said Greg Jensen, co-CIO at Bridgewater Associates. “Working with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, we are using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude model to create a secure large language model-powered Investment Analyst Assistant that will be able to generate elaborate charts, compute financial indicators, and create summaries of the results, based on both minimal and complex instructions. This flexible solution will accelerate the more mundane, yet still involved, steps of our research process, enabling our analysts to spend more time on the difficult and differentiated aspects of understanding markets and economies.”

“We are working with AWS and Anthropic to host our custom, fine-tuned Anthropic Claude 2 model on Amazon Bedrock to support our strategy of rapidly delivering generative AI solutions at scale and with cutting-edge encryption, data privacy, and safe AI technology embedded in everything we do,” said Jeff Reihl, executive vice president and CTO at LexisNexis Legal & Professional. “Our new Lexis+ AI platform technology features conversational search, insightful summarization, and intelligent legal drafting capabilities, which enable lawyers to increase their efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity.”

Amazon and Anthropic are each engaged across a number of organizations to promote the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) AI working groups, the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), the Partnership on AI, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Responsible AI Institute. In July, both Amazon and Anthropic joined President Biden and other industry leaders at the White House to show their support for a set of voluntary commitments to foster the safe, secure, responsible, and effective development of AI technology. These commitments are a continuation of work that both Amazon and Anthropic have been doing to support the safety, security, and responsible development and deployment of AI and will continue through this expanded collaboration."

The FTC accuses Amazon of maintaining an illegal monopoly that negatively impacts retailers including Walmart (NYSE: ) and Macy's (NYSE: ).

Amazon, acknowledged by Insider Intelligence as holding a 38% market share, is charged with employing ""interlocking anticompetitive strategies"". These strategies allegedly position the company as a dominant marketplace landlord, seller, and delivery business, thus creating an unfair competitive environment.

In response to the lawsuit, Amazon has defended its practices. The tech giant argues that its operational methods are designed to prevent higher prices for consumers and slower delivery times. This rebuttal suggests that without such practices in place, consumers could face increased costs and delayed deliveries.

The FTC's legal action against Amazon forms part of an ongoing examination of the company's market dominance. The outcome of this lawsuit could potentially reshape the dynamics of the e-commerce sector in the United States.

Lawmakers in scramble to avert government shutdown

Lawmakers in Washington appear to be stepping up the pace to avert a government shutdown by the Oct. 1 deadline that would force the federal government to stop non-essential operations.

The Senate plans Tuesday to vote on a bill to extend government funding for 45 days, which if passed, would then proceed to the House for Republican House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy to decide whether to bring it up for a vote.

But there isn’t a guarantee that it will pass the House as a group of conservative lawmakers are opposed to short-term funding extension."

""Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,"" said FTC Chair Khan.

""The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them,"" she added.

The complaint alleged that Amazon violates the law not because it is big, but because it engages in a course of exclusionary conduct that prevents current competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging. By stifling competition on price, product selection, quality, and by preventing its current or future rivals from attracting a critical mass of shoppers and sellers, Amazon ensures that no current or future rival can threaten its dominance.

Amazon’s far-reaching schemes impact hundreds of billions of dollars in retail sales every year, touch hundreds of thousands of products sold by businesses big and small and affect over a hundred million shoppers, said the FTC.

Amazon’s ongoing pattern of illegal conduct blocks competition, allowing it to wield monopoly power to inflate prices, degrade quality, and stifle innovation for consumers and businesses

The Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general today sued Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Inc. alleging that the online retail and technology company is a monopolist that uses a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The FTC and its state partners say Amazon’s actions allow it to stop rivals and sellers from lowering prices, degrade quality for shoppers, overcharge sellers, stifle innovation, and prevent rivals from fairly competing against Amazon.

The complaint alleges that Amazon violates the law not because it is big, but because it engages in a course of exclusionary conduct that prevents current competitors from growing and new competitors from emerging. By stifling competition on price, product selection, quality, and by preventing its current or future rivals from attracting a critical mass of shoppers and sellers, Amazon ensures that no current or future rival can threaten its dominance. Amazon’s far-reaching schemes impact hundreds of billions of dollars in retail sales every year, touch hundreds of thousands of products sold by businesses big and small and affect over a hundred million shoppers.

“Our complaint lays out how Amazon has used a set of punitive and coercive tactics to unlawfully maintain its monopolies,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The complaint sets forth detailed allegations noting how Amazon is now exploiting its monopoly power to enrich itself while raising prices and degrading service for the tens of millions of American families who shop on its platform and the hundreds of thousands of businesses that rely on Amazon to reach them. Today’s lawsuit seeks to hold Amazon to account for these monopolistic practices and restore the lost promise of free and fair competition.”

“We’re bringing this case because Amazon’s illegal conduct has stifled competition across a huge swath of the online economy. Amazon is a monopolist that uses its power to hike prices on American shoppers and charge sky-high fees on hundreds of thousands of online sellers,” said John Newman, Deputy Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition. “Seldom in the history of U.S. antitrust law has one case had the potential to do so much good for so many people.”

The FTC and states allege Amazon’s anticompetitive conduct occurs in two markets—the online superstore market that serves shoppers and the market for online marketplace services purchased by sellers. These tactics include:

Anti-discounting measures that punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering prices lower than Amazon, keeping prices higher for products across the internet. For example, if Amazon discovers that a seller is offering lower-priced goods elsewhere, Amazon can bury discounting sellers so far down in Amazon’s search results that they become effectively invisible.

Conditioning sellers’ ability to obtain “Prime” eligibility for their products—a virtual necessity for doing business on Amazon—on sellers using Amazon’s costly fulfillment service, which has made it substantially more expensive for sellers on Amazon to also offer their products on other platforms. This unlawful coercion has in turn limited competitors’ ability to effectively compete against Amazon.

Amazon’s illegal, exclusionary conduct makes it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold. With its amassed power across both the online superstore market and online marketplace services market, Amazon extracts enormous monopoly rents from everyone within its reach. This includes:

Degrading the customer experience by replacing relevant, organic search results with paid advertisements—and deliberately increasing junk ads that worsen search quality and frustrate both shoppers seeking products and sellers who are promised a return on their advertising purchase.

Biasing Amazon’s search results to preference Amazon’s own products over ones that Amazon knows are of better quality.

Charging costly fees on the hundreds of thousands of sellers that currently have no choice but to rely on Amazon to stay in business. These fees range from a monthly fee sellers must pay for each item sold, to advertising fees that have become virtually necessary for sellers to do business. Combined, all of these fees force many sellers to pay close to 50% of their total revenues to Amazon. These fees harm not only sellers but also shoppers, who pay increased prices for thousands of products sold on or off Amazon.

The FTC, along with its state partners, are seeking a permanent injunction in federal court that would prohibit Amazon from engaging in its unlawful conduct and pry loose Amazon’s monopolistic control to restore competition.

Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin joined the Commission’s lawsuit. The Commission vote to authorize staff to file for a permanent injunction and other equitable relief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington was 3-0.

NOTE: The Commission issues a complaint when it has “reason to believe” that the law has been or is being violated, and it appears to the Commission that a proceeding is in the public interest."

2022-09-26, Investing.com,"U.S. futures dip, Moody's flags government shutdown impact - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-futures-dip-moodys-flags-government-shutdown-impact--whats-moving-markets-3824063,"Investing.com -- Stock futures inch down, hinting a possible reversal from a positive session on Monday, as Wall Street's main indices are on pace to post losses in September. Meanwhile, investors gauge developments in an ongoing budgetary stand-off in Washington, as Moody's (NYSE: ) warns that a potential government shutdown caused by the fight will be ""negative"" for the U.S.'s rating. Elsewhere, President Biden prepares to visit Michigan to show his backing for striking auto workers.

1. Stock futures edge lower

U.S. stock futures moved down on Tuesday, pointing to a pullback from gains in the previous session, with the major indices on Wall Street on track to end September lower.

At 04:49 ET (08:49 GMT), the contract shed 117 points or 0.3%, lost 18 points or 0.4%, and fell by 72 points or 0.5%.

Along with the fallout from the Federal Reserve's hawkish policy update last week, investors began the final trading week of the month eyeing an ongoing budgetary stand-off in Washington that threatens to culminate in a potential government shutdown.

On Monday, the benchmark , tech-heavy , and 30-stock climbed, snapping four-day losing streaks. Sentiment was supported by an uptick in shares in e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which announced plans to invest in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic, adding more fuel to the hype around emerging AI technology.

But all of the indices are still on course to finish September in the red, with the S&P 500 in particular heading for its worst month since December.

2. U.S. House to consider spending bills as possible government shutdown looms

The U.S. House of Representatives is set to consider four conservative-backed spending bills for the upcoming fiscal year on Tuesday, although they are not widely expected to become law and may force a possible government shutdown as early as October 1.

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a top Republican leader in Washington, has attempted to appease some members of his party by advancing the pieces of legislation, which include restrictions on abortion access and cuts to expenditures on climate initiatives. In return, McCarthy hopes to secure enough support from far-right GOP lawmakers to pass a stopgap funding bill that would temporarily avert a shutdown.

However, hardline Republicans, many of whom were displeased with a prior spending agreement forged by McCarthy and President Joe Biden earlier this year, have expressed reservations about backing a stopgap measure.

Moody's, a credit rating agency, warned on Monday that a shutdown would ""underscore the weakness"" of U.S. institutions and governance compared to other countries with a similar top-notch triple-A rating.

3. Biden to visit Michigan amid auto workers' strike

President Biden will head to Michigan on Tuesday, with the famously pro-union leader tipped to show his support for the United Auto Workers union's ongoing strike against Detroit carmakers.

Biden's visit comes as Ford Motor (NYSE: ) has flagged that ""significant gaps"" remain in its negotiations with the UAW despite recently improving its offer. Ford, along with General Motors (NYSE: ) and Jeep-manufacturer Stellantis (NYSE: ), have proposed pay rises, although the union has said differences remain around issues like pension benefits and working conditions.

The UAW's walkouts, which began on September 15 at assembly plants owned by these so-called Detroit Three firms, have led to tens of thousands of workers taking to the picket lines.

Biden, who is preparing to run for re-election next year, has yet to receive a formal endorsement from the UAW. He has called on car companies to ""go further"" to share corporate profits with the union's members.

Meanwhile, former president Donald Trump plans to hold a rally for auto workers in Detroit on Wednesday, as he attempts to regain the support of many blue-collar voters ahead of his own 2024 election bid.

4. Evergrande shares slip for second-straight day

Shares in China Evergrande Group (HK: ) slumped for a second consecutive day on Tuesday after the indebted developer announced that one its main domestic units had missed an onshore bond payment.

Evergrande's Hengda Real Estate Group announced in a Hong Kong stock exchange filing that it had not paid the principal and interest on a 4 billion yuan bond that was due by September 25.

Shares in Evergrande subsequently fell by 8.14%.

It marked the latest setback for Evergrande, the embattled property group that has been at the center of a real estate crisis weighing on the wider Chinese economy. On Monday, the company's stock tumbled by more than 20% after it announced that it was unable to issue new debt because of an investigation into Hengda.

5. Oil prices decline on fuel demand fears

Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, as traders gauged how fuel demand may be impacted by key central banks suggesting that they could keep interest rates higher for longer to combat inflation.

Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank both restated their commitment to corraling price gains, hinting that policy may remain tighter for a longer-than-anticipated period of time. Such a tactic would likely hit economic activity, which in turn could dampen oil demand.

Elsewhere, Evergrande's woes this week have renewed stress over economic growth in China -- the world's largest crude importer -- over the rest of the year.

Partly offsetting these demand concerns are supplies, which are still largely tight after Russia and Saudi Arabia extended output cuts until the end of 2022.

By 04:49 ET, the futures traded 1.1% lower at $88.74 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.0% to $90.95."

Limp joins Blue Origin at a key phase of the company’s multiple space projects.

In a statement to CNBC, a Blue Origin spokesperson praised Limp as “a proven innovator with a customer-first mindset” who has “extensive experience in the high-tech industry and growing highly complex organisations”.

Limp, head of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) devices and services who has been with the company for nearly 14 years, confirmed in August that he was stepping down.

Panos Panay, Microsoft’s former Windows and Surface chief, is reportedly joining Amazon to oversee its hardware business.

Panay is likely to run Amazon’s division for its Alexa and Echo speakers.

Blue Origin won a $3.4 billion NASA contract earlier this year to build a lunar lander for the US space agency’s astronauts.

Under Smith’s leadership, Blue Origin has grown to several billion dollars in sales orders, “with a substantial backlog for our vehicles and engines"", Bezos wrote in his email.

“Our team has increased from 850 people when Bob joined to more than 10,000 today. We’ve expanded from one office in Kent to building a launch pad at LC-36 and five million square feet of facilities across seven states,” he added.

Wall Street indices suffer weak month

The main indices on Wall Street look set to enter the final week of September on a negative note, with the indication from the U.S. central bank that interest rates will remain elevated for longer than expected weighing heavily.

The tech sector has been hardest hit, with the on track to slump 5.9% this month, potentially its biggest monthly loss since December. The broad-based is set to drop 4.2% this month, while the blue-chip has shed 2.2%.

The held rates steady last week, but signaled it might raise them one more time this year. It also pointed to only two rate cuts next year, half the number they anticipated in their last round of forecasts in June.

There are a number of U.S. central bank officials scheduled to speak this week, starting with Minneapolis Fed President later Monday. Their comments will be studied carefully for clues of future policy moves, particularly with key i due for release at the end of the week.

Budget stand-off continues

Also weighing on sentiment is Congress' ongoing budget stand-off, with the federal government set to run out of funding for its operations at the start of October unless lawmakers can hammer out a deal.

Over the weekend, Democrats and Republicans in Congress both warned that there is a chance a deal will not be reached. Even a plan to create a 45-day extension to government funding to give legislators more time coming up against strong resistance by a handful of GOP holdouts in the House.

Washington's latest budgetary showdown comes only a few months after a battle over the U.S. debt limit almost brought the world's largest economy to the brink of a damaging default.

Amazon seeks to boost AI position

In corporate news, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said on Monday that it is aiming to invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence group Anthropic, as the tech giant looks to bolster its position in the corporate arms race over nascent AI technology. Amazon shares were up 1.1%.

Additionally, the entertainment sector could benefit from Sunday’s news that the union representing Hollywood writers reached a preliminary agreement with major studios and streaming companies on a new contract that could end their months-long strike.

rebounds from losing week

Oil prices edged higher Monday, rebounding after their first negative week in four as traders returned their focus to the prospect of tighter supplies going forward.

Both contracts fell last week after a hawkish Federal Reserve stance raised concerns of a hit to economic activity and thus oil demand in the largest consumer in the world.

However, prices remain near their highest levels since November last year on forecasts of a wide crude supply deficit in the fourth quarter in the wake of Saudi Arabia and Russia extending additional supply cuts to the end of the year.

As part of the expanded collaboration:

Anthropic will use AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS. The two companies will also collaborate in the development of future Trainium and Inferentia technology.

AWS will become Anthropic’s primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads, including safety research and future foundation model development. Anthropic plans to run the majority of its workloads on AWS, further providing Anthropic with the advanced technology of the world’s leading cloud provider.

Anthropic makes a long-term commitment to provide AWS customers around the world with access to future generations of its foundation models via Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s fully managed service that provides secure access to the industry’s top foundation models. In addition, Anthropic will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.

Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic and have a minority ownership position in the company.

Amazon developers and engineers will be able to build with Anthropic models via Amazon Bedrock so they can incorporate generative AI capabilities into their work, enhance existing applications, and create net-new customer experiences across Amazon’s businesses.

“We have tremendous respect for Anthropic’s team and foundation models, and believe we can help improve many customer experiences, short and long-term, through our deeper collaboration,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “Customers are quite excited about Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s new managed service that enables companies to use various foundation models to build generative AI applications on top of, as well as AWS Trainium, AWS’s AI training chip, and our collaboration with Anthropic should help customers get even more value from these two capabilities.”

“We are excited to use AWS’s Trainium chips to develop future foundation models,” said Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of Anthropic. “Since announcing our support of Amazon Bedrock in April, Claude has seen significant organic adoption from AWS customers. By significantly expanding our partnership, we can unlock new possibilities for organizations of all sizes, as they deploy Anthropic’s safe, state-of-the-art AI systems together with AWS’s leading cloud technology.”

An AWS customer since 2021, Anthropic has grown quickly into one of the world’s leading foundation model providers and a leading advocate for the responsible deployment of generative AI. Their foundation model, Claude, excels at a wide range of tasks, from sophisticated dialogue and creative content generation to complex reasoning and detailed instruction, while maintaining a high degree of reliability and predictability. Its industry-leading 100,000 token context window can securely process extensive amounts of information across all industries, from manufacturing and aerospace to agriculture and consumer goods, as well as technical, domain-specific documents for industries such as finance, legal, and healthcare. Customers report that Claude is much less likely to produce harmful outputs, easier to converse with, and more steerable compared to other foundation models, so developers can get their desired output with less effort. Anthropic’s state-of-the-art model, Claude 2, scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Today’s news is the latest AWS generative AI announcement as the company continues to expand its unique offering at all three layers of the generative AI stack. At the bottom layer, AWS continues to offer compute instances from NVIDIA as well as AWS’s own custom silicon chips, AWS Trainium for AI training and AWS Inferentia for AI inference. At the middle layer, AWS is focused on providing customers with the broadest selection of foundation models from multiple leading providers where customers can then customize those models, keep their own data private and secure, and seamlessly integrate with the rest of their AWS workloads—all of this is offered through AWS’s new service, Amazon Bedrock. With today’s announcement, customers will have early access to features for customizing Anthropic models, using their own proprietary data to create their own private models, and will be able to utilize fine-tuning capabilities via a self-service feature within Amazon Bedrock. At the top layer, AWS offers generative AI applications and services for customers like Amazon CodeWhisperer, a powerful AI-powered coding companion, which recommends code snippets directly in the code editor, accelerating developer productivity as they code.

As part of this deeper collaboration, AWS and Anthropic are committing meaningful resources that are helping customers get started with Claude and Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, including through the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, where teams of AI experts will help customers of all sizes to develop new generative AI-powered applications to transform their organizations.

Customers accessing Anthropic’s current models via Amazon Bedrock are building generative AI-powered applications that help automate tasks such as producing market forecasts, developing research reports, enabling new drug discovery for healthcare, and personalizing education programs. Enterprises already taking advantage of this advanced technology include Lonely Planet, a premier travel media company celebrated for its decades of travel content; Bridgewater Associates, a premier asset management firm for global institutional investors; and LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a top-tier global provider of information and analytics serving customers in more than 150 countries.

“We are developing a generative AI solution on AWS to help customers plan epic trips and create life-changing experiences with personalized travel itineraries,” said Chris Whyde, senior vice president of Engineering and Data Science at Lonely Planet. “By building with Claude 2 on Amazon Bedrock, we reduced itinerary generation costs by nearly 80 percent when we quickly created a scalable, secure AI platform that organizes our book content in minutes to deliver cohesive, highly accurate travel recommendations. Now we can re-package and personalize our content in various ways on our digital platforms, based on customer preference, all while highlighting trusted local voices–just like Lonely Planet has done for 50 years.”

“At Bridgewater, we believe the global economic machine can be understood, so we strive to build a fundamental, cause-and-effect understanding of markets and economies powered by cutting-edge technology,” said Greg Jensen, co-CIO at Bridgewater Associates. “Working with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, we are using Amazon Bedrock and Anthropic’s Claude model to create a secure large language model-powered Investment Analyst Assistant that will be able to generate elaborate charts, compute financial indicators, and create summaries of the results, based on both minimal and complex instructions.

These commitments are a continuation of work that both Amazon and Anthropic have been doing to support the safety, security, and responsible development and deployment of AI and will continue through this expanded collaboration."

The investment comes on the heels of Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s extensive multi-year financial commitment to OpenAI. Google (NASDAQ: ), another significant player in the AI race, has also invested in Anthropic. These investments underscore the escalating interest and competition in the AI sector among technology giants.

As part of the deal, Amazon will acquire a minority stake in Anthropic. The startup plans to use Amazon Web Services' (AWS) proprietary chips to develop, train, and deploy its AI software. AWS will become Anthropic's primary cloud provider under this agreement.

In addition to providing infrastructure support, Amazon will offer its cloud customers early access to Anthropic’s technology via Amazon Bedrock, the firm's AI platform for businesses. This strategic move underlines Amazon's determination not to fall behind its competitors in this rapidly expanding sector.

The investment signifies a significant commitment from Amazon to advance its position in the AI race against other tech behemoths.

2022-09-25, IANS,Amazon to invest up to $4 bn in AI startup Anthropic in GenAI era,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-bn-in-ai-startup-anthropic-in-genai-era-3822319,"New Delhi, Sep 25 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic with a minority ownership position in the company, as competition grows in the growing generative AI market ruled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS.

The two companies will also collaborate in the development of future Trainium and Inferentia technology.

“Customers are quite excited about Amazon Bedrock, AWS’s new managed service that enables companies to use various foundation models to build generative AI applications on top of, as well as AWS Trainium, AWS’s AI training chip, and our collaboration with Anthropic should help customers get even more value from these two capabilities,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO.

2022-09-25, IANS,"Global experts converge at MASCRADE 2022 to unveil hidden links between smuggling, crime and terrorism",https://in.investing.com/news/global-experts-converge-at-mascrade-2022-to-unveil-hidden-links-between-smuggling-crime-and-terrorism-3822276,"New Delhi, Sep 25 (IANS) FICCI’s Committee Against Smuggling and Counterfeiting Destroying the Economy (CASCADE) is organising its annual flagship international conference - the ‘9th edition of MASCRADE (Movement Against Smuggled and Counterfeit Trade).The two-day conference, themed ‘Tackling Illicit Trade: Socio-Economic Perspectives and Way Forward’ is scheduled on September 28- 29 in Delhi.

MASCRADE 2022 aims to facilitate substantive discussions among the stakeholders, analysing the detrimental socio-economic consequences of illicit trade.

The conclave, with an objective to foster widespread awareness on the subject, will have plenary sessions on ‘Exposing the lethal linkages of Illicit Trade and Terror Financing’, ‘Multilateral Approach to Intelligence Sharing and Strengthening Investigations’, ‘Harnessing the Power of New Age & Emerging Technologies in Preventing Illicit Trade’, ‘Detecting and Disrupting the Daunting Impact of Organised Crime, Terror Financing, and Illicit Trade’, ‘The Power of Judicial Intervention’s among others.

The International conference will see a galaxy of distinguished national and international experts who will not only deliberate and delve deep into the connections between smuggling, organised crime, and terror financing, but will also share their recommendations on the strategies, collaboration, and the implementation of state-of-the-art technologies to combat this threat, which is adversely impacting our society and economy.

Over the years the conference has witnessed notable representatives from various global institutions like WIPO, UNODC, OECD, INTERPOL, WCO, UKIPO, USPTO, US Department of Homeland Security, Australian Border Force, among others who have collaborated with this initiative, demonstrating their commitment to address this global challenge.

MASCRADE which is now being held for over a decade now has garnered significant delegate interest, extensive media coverage, and featured a diverse lineup of eminent speakers from across the globe. The ensuing reports and recommendations are also shared with policymakers at the highest levels.

MASCRADE 2022 is set to feature an impressive lineup of distinguished speakers from renowned global organisations, including WCO, WIPO, UNODC, INCB-UN, INTERPOL and JETRO.

It will also have addresses by Indian policy makers and senior government officials from Department of Revenue, Directorate of Enforcement, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, and Financial Intelligence Unit.

Moreover, subject matter experts from several countries, including Denmark, Italy, France, and Belgium, and eminent professionals in areas such as cyber law, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce, will contribute their valuable insights during the conference.

Additionally, Prominent corporations such as ITC, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Kenvue, and RealNetworks India will also actively participate in the event.

At the conference, FICCI CASCADE and the Thought Arbitrage Research Institute (TARI) will unveil a comprehensive report titled 'Hidden Streams: Linkages between Illicit Markets, Financial Flows, Organised Crime, and Terrorism.'

This report will examine and reveal the concealed connections between smuggling and the funding of criminal activities and terrorism. It will also address the repercussions on the socio-economic structure of nations and present a roadmap for the future to tackle the issue.

Anil Rajput, Chairman, FICCI CASCADE said: “The intricate interplay between illicit markets, financial flows, organised crime and terrorism weaves a complex web that presents a formidable challenge to the socio-economic stability of nations worldwide. During the 90th INTERPOL General Assembly held in India last year, our Prime Minister had said that money from illicit sources such as smuggling gets pushed into evil activities and becomes one of the major sources of terror funding. The theme of MASCRADE 2022 is inspired by his focus to eliminate such traffickers, smugglers, terrorists, or organised crime to protect our communities and economies. We are looking forward to an engaging and insightful event this year with an aim to create a comprehensive and actionable plan to combat illicit trade and its linkages to organised crime.”

A 2022 FICCI CASCADE study titled 'Illicit Markets: A Threat to Our National Interests' revealed a staggering 163 per cent increase in tax losses due to smuggling in India from 2010 to 2020. The government faced a substantial financial impact, with losses reaching Rs 58,521 crore, compared to Rs 22,230 crore, spanning crucial sectors such as alcoholic beverages, mobile phones, FMCG-household and personal goods, FMCG-packaged foods, and tobacco products. These industries collectively suffered an astounding 340 per cent surge in sales losses, escalating from Rs 59,046 crore in 2010 to Rs 2,60,094 crore in 2020, highlighting the gravity of the illicit trade issue.

Smuggling and counterfeiting threaten India's path to a 5 trillion-dollar economy, causing harm to industries, hampering job creation and impeding economic growth. Illicit trade presents a dual challenge - it not only deprives the government of tax revenue but also requires increased resource allocation for enforcement to curb such activities.

Like previous years, FICCI CASCADE will organise an Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Smuggling Awards and Felicitation Ceremony at MASCRADE 2022 to honour select enforcement officers, school children and journalists for their efforts towards countering illicit trade.

Boston Fed president Susan Collins, meanwhile, also said additional rate hikes are ""not off the table.""

Treasury yields gave up some gains, but remained at multiyear highs following huge swings higher earlier this week after the Fed skipped a rate hike on Wednesday, but reduced the number of rate cuts to two from four next year, suggesting rates will remain higher for even longer than many had expected.

2022-09-22, Investing.com,Amazon to host another Prime Big Deal Days in October after successful sales in previous quarters,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-to-host-another-prime-big-deal-days-in-october-after-successful-sales-in-previous-quarters-93CH-3820818,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is set to host a two-day shopping event, ""Prime Big Deal Days"", starting October 10, 2022. This announcement comes a little over two months after its last Prime Day sale and over a month before the Black Friday weekend. The event is a continuation of Amazon's commitment to providing member-exclusive shopping events with significant discounts.

The upcoming event follows the company's previous ""Prime Early Access Sale"", which was held in October last year. During these events, new deals appear as often as every five minutes at certain times, and members are encouraged to register for exclusive lists that offer special deals on selected products.

These Prime Day events have historically driven sales growth for Amazon. The inaugural ""Prime Early Access Sale"", held on October 11 and 12, 2022, marked an improvement in inventory conditions and showcased innovative approaches to discounting products to stimulate sales.

Last year's Prime Early Access Sale surpassed management's expectations, as highlighted by Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky during their fourth-quarter earnings call. Moreover, Amazon's Prime Day event in July was noted for its record-breaking first-day sales.

The e-commerce giant has been experiencing a gradual acceleration in revenue growth over recent quarters. Following an 8.5% year-over-year increase in Q4 2022, revenue rose by 9.4% in Q1 2022 and 10.8% in Q2 2022. This upward trend was largely driven by the company's e-commerce segment, where sales growth improved from 2% in Q4 2022 to 3% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 2022, respectively.

Analysts forecast this growth momentum will continue into the second half of the year, predicting an average revenue increase of 11.4% in Q3 and 11.6% in Q4. Given Amazon's track record with sales events, these estimates may prove to be conservative, particularly considering the company's current trend of accelerating growth.

While the upcoming shopping event is not expected to significantly alter Amazon's long-term stock performance, it remains a crucial factor in driving the company's accelerating revenue trends. As such, investors should consider the stock's value independently of the event but also recognize the potential boost that Prime Big Deal Days could provide to Amazon's top-line growth.

Initially, the ad integration will be introduced in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada, with France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia following later in the year. The move comes as part of Amazon's strategy to sustain investment in high-quality content amid intense competition among streaming platforms.

Prime subscribers in the U.S. will be given the choice to maintain an ad-free service for an additional $2.99 per month. The pricing for ad-free programming in countries outside the U.S. will be disclosed at a later date. Amazon has confirmed that there are no plans to change the price of Prime membership next year.

The decision by Amazon follows a trend set by other streaming platforms diversifying their subscription levels to balance fresh content generation and subscriber retention against potential losses due to price increases. For instance, Disney intends to launch a $13.99 monthly subscription for its ad-free Disney+ service starting mid-October in the U.S., a 75% increase from its ad-supported tier. Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s ad-free plan is currently priced at $15.49 per month, over double the cost of its ad-inclusive subscription.

Before introducing advertisements into its programming, Amazon plans to notify U.S. Prime members several weeks in advance via email, offering information on how to opt for the ad-free service if desired.

Despite these changes, live events on Amazon Prime, such as sports already feature advertising. The limited advertisements during shows and movies starting next year are part of a broader strategy to facilitate continued investment in high-quality content.

The rollout is set to begin in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada in early 2024, with additional countries like France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia getting ads later in the year.

Amazon shares rose 1.3% in early Friday trade.

Previously, Prime Video viewers experienced ads during exclusive broadcasts of Thursday Night Football. Now, these commercial breaks will expand to non-sports content on the platform.

Amazon has stated that the ad load will be ""limited,” which suggests that Amazon is cautious about not overwhelming viewers with advertising within its streaming service.

“We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers,” the company said in a blog post.

Amazon Prime members who have enjoyed ad-free access to Prime Video content as part of their membership will face an additional fee starting next year. The new fee, set at $2.99 per month in the U.S., will be required for Prime members who wish to continue watching Prime Video content without ads.

Meanwhile, the monthly Prime membership cost will remain unchanged for those who are willing to watch content with ads.

2022-09-22, Investing.com,Overstock faces challenges following Bed Bath & Beyond rebranding,https://in.investing.com/news/overstock-faces-challenges-following-bed-bath--beyond-rebranding-93CH-3819557,"Overstock.com (NASDAQ: ), the online furniture liquidator, is experiencing a significant drop in stock value following its rebranding to Bed Bath & Beyond (OTC: ), despite initial investor enthusiasm. The company purchased Bed Bath & Beyond's brand and intellectual property for $21.5 million in June 2022 and officially implemented the name change on August 1.

Following the acquisition announcement, Overstock's stock surged 76% due to positive investor sentiment. However, this enthusiasm has since waned, with the stock plummeting 52% from August 1 to Thursday. A September 6 update on the company's corporate identity transition revealed smaller than anticipated improvements in web traffic and active customer numbers, contributing to the decline.

Despite Bed Bath & Beyond's brand carrying advantages such as higher brand awareness and a stronger association with home goods, it also has drawbacks. The brand has experienced a period of decline which may have negatively impacted its value. Additionally, Overstock now faces stiff competition from retail giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), and Target who offer services like same-day delivery or in-store pickup options that Overstock does not provide.

These competitors also have the capacity to undercut Overstock’s prices. While Bed Bath’s prices are currently competitive, this could be affecting profit margins as the company attempts to reposition itself in a saturated market.

In an attempt to regain customer loyalty, Overstock initiated a promotional campaign. The company estimates that Bed Bath had nearly 20 million active customers in its last year of operation, half of whom made at least one online purchase in the past year. At its peak, Bed Bath had nearly 40 million shoppers.

However, these efforts might weigh on profitability in the short term. There are concerns that customer acquisition will be slower than Overstock anticipates, potentially extending the investment phase beyond the expected few quarters.

Despite these challenges, Overstock's strong balance sheet and solid cash reserves may help it weather the storm. The company is expected to become more efficient with its marketing expenses over time. While Overstock has inherited a well-known brand that could drive long-term growth, it has also inherited some of Bed Bath & Beyond's significant challenges. Only time will reveal how these factors will balance out.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Oracle reasserts $65 billion revenue forecast for 2026 despite recent setbacks,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-reasserts-65-billion-revenue-forecast-for-2026-despite-recent-setbacks-93CH-3819242,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ). has reaffirmed its yearly revenue projection of $65 billion by the fiscal year 2026, a forecast initially shared with investors a year ago. This reassertion comes despite recent quarterly results that left some investors disappointed. Oracle's Executive Vice President, Doug Kehring, restated these projections at the company's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday. He expressed confidence in reaching the stated revenue goal, maintaining a 45% operating margin by fiscal 2026, and achieving an over 10% annual increase in earnings per share.

The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its cloud-computing rental business, an area where it has historically lagged behind competitors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.’s Google. However, investor optimism has been growing as Oracle's cloud services are believed to have the potential to grow rapidly and meet the high-demand computing needs of artificial intelligence products.

Kehring emphasized that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which generated $5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending May 2022, is targeting Google. However, this revenue represented only about 10% of Oracle's total income.

Investor enthusiasm was dampened last week when Oracle reported a 30% increase in cloud sales for the quarter, compared to a 54% surge in the previous period. This announcement led to a nearly 14% drop in Oracle's shares, marking the largest single-day decline in over two decades and pulling them down from an all-time peak.

Ahead of Thursday's event, many analysts anticipated that Oracle would maintain its outlook. To reach its target, the company needs to sustain an average annual sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the next three fiscal years.

However, given the recent slowdown in Oracle's electronic health records division Cerner (NASDAQ: ), which it acquired last year, and the ongoing shift to cloud services, some analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana, believe this to be a challenging endeavor.

On Thursday, Oracle's shares fell by 2.8% to $109.65 at 3:13 p.m. in New York. Despite last week's drop, the stock had risen by 38% this year through Wednesday's close.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Amazon's planned merchant fee to be scrapped - Bloomberg,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-planned-merchant-fee-to-be-scrapped--bloomberg-432SI-3818664,"Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) planned fee on merchants that don't use its shipping services will be discarded, according to a report by Bloomberg on Thursday.

The publication said it had seen documents confirming the move. The U-turn from the e-commerce giant suggests it is being more cautious about the amount of money it tries to pull from online sellers as it battles an escalating antitrust investigation.

In August, Amazon announced the 2% fee on merchants, stating it would take effect on October 1, although it was met with discontent from Amazon merchants and consultants. It was also seen as a ""brazen move since the US government is poised to file an antitrust lawsuit against the e-commerce giant,"" said Bloomberg.

They explained that the federal case is predicted to focus partly on Amazon's alleged efforts to push merchants into using its logistics services.

Bloomberg said an Amazon spokesperson emailed them, stating the 2% Seller Fulfilled Prime fee was intended to cover the company's costs, ""but after careful consideration,"" they've made the decision ""not to implement this program fee to ensure seller sentiment related to the fee does not impact program participation."""
2022-09-21, Investing.com,Tether invests $420M in GPU chips amid AI tech sector growth,https://in.investing.com/news/tether-invests-420m-in-gpu-chips-amid-ai-tech-sector-growth-93CH-3818566,"Renowned cryptocurrency firm Holdings has made a substantial strategic investment in the artificial intelligence (AI) tech sector, purchasing 10,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) H100 GPUs for $420 million. The acquisition was made through an Irish shell company, Damoon, on behalf of Northern Data, a German miner. This investment grants Tether a 20% stake in Northern Data, according to Forbes' report published earlier this week.

The transaction was necessitated by a chip scarcity that prevented Northern Data from directly securing the GPUs, which are highly sought after for their data processing capabilities essential in AI applications. Nvidia's GPUs are widely used in data centers and cloud computing applications, contributing to the company's market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion.

This move aligns with an ongoing trend among Bitcoin mining companies diversifying their revenue streams by venturing into the burgeoning AI industry. Companies like Coreweave have successfully transitioned from crypto mining to providing GPU-specialized cloud services, as acknowledged by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

The deal could potentially position Northern Data as one of Europe's largest cloud GPU operators, rivaling cloud computing giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). The company plans to rent out the GPUs to AI startups.

Despite the strategic investment, both Tether and Northern Data have faced controversies in the past. In 2022, Tether incurred a $21 million fine for misleading claims about its financials. On the other hand, Northern Data faced challenges with timely financial reporting and even had a criminal complaint filed by German regulators over inaccurate revenue reports.

Nevertheless, both companies continue to make significant strides in their respective sectors. Tether recently reported over $1 billion in profits for the last quarter and announced a $115 million share buyback. Meanwhile, Northern Data continues its pivot towards AI technology through this partnership with Tether.

With Adaptive Content, Echo Hub uses infrared technology to detect when someone is nearby, and naturally transitions from a home screen with a beautiful clock, to the smart home control screen, the company said.

The Echo Frames and Carrera Smart Glasses introduce seven new frame styles, reimagined audio design, long-lasting battery, and hands-free access to Alexa, and start at $269.99.

Amazon also introduced enhanced conversational voice search with generative AI, upgrades to the Fire TV Ambient Experience, and the most powerful Fire TV Sticks yet -- the all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max, now with the Fire TV Ambient Experience, and Fire TV Stick 4K.

Despite the gains, investor sentiment remained cautious due to concerns over the potential economic fallout of rates staying higher for longer. This follows Tuesday's selloff, which was fueled by uncertainty around the rates trajectory and concerns over the U.S. economy.

Gabriele Foà, Portfolio Manager at Algebris Investments, noted that the Fed's updated projections are likely to show one more hike in 2022, with an aim to stabilize inflation amidst higher growth in 2022/24. Recent economic data has suggested an easing in core inflation, fueling bets of a likely peak in interest rates. However, surging oil prices have impacted headline inflation figures, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to project higher-for-longer rates.

In response to these developments, financial markets have priced a 99% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged and a near 71% likelihood of standing pat in November, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, marketing automation company Klaviyo made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The Boston-based company had secured a valuation of $9.2 billion in its initial public offering after pricing shares above their indicated range.

In other market movements, Instacart's shares lost 5.0% following their debut on Tuesday, while Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a decrease of 0.9%. Dollar General (NYSE: ) fell by 1.3% after J.P. Morgan downgraded the discount store operator to ""underweight"".

U.S. Treasury yields retreated from their 2007 highs ahead of Wednesday's announcement by the Federal Reserve. This helped megacap growth stocks such as Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) notch gains, rising between 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively.

AWS will become Anthropic’s primary cloud provider for mission critical workloads, including safety research and future foundation model development.

Anthropic plans to run the majority of its workloads on AWS, further providing Anthropic with the advanced technology of the world’s leading cloud provider.

Amazon developers and engineers will be able to build with Anthropic models via Amazon Bedrock so they can incorporate generative AI capabilities into their work, enhance existing applications, and create net-new customer experiences across Amazon’s businesses, the companies said in a statement.

MASCRADE 2022 aims to facilitate substantive discussions among the stakeholders, analysing the detrimental socio-economic consequences of illicit trade.

The conclave, with an objective to foster widespread awareness on the subject, will have plenary sessions on ‘Exposing the lethal linkages of Illicit Trade and Terror Financing’, ‘Multilateral Approach to Intelligence Sharing and Strengthening Investigations’, ‘Harnessing the Power of New Age & Emerging Technologies in Preventing Illicit Trade’, ‘Detecting and Disrupting the Daunting Impact of Organised Crime, Terror Financing, and Illicit Trade’, ‘The Power of Judicial Intervention’s among others.

The International conference will see a galaxy of distinguished national and international experts who will not only deliberate and delve deep into the connections between smuggling, organised crime, and terror financing, but will also share their recommendations on the strategies, collaboration, and the implementation of state-of-the-art technologies to combat this threat, which is adversely impacting our society and economy.

Over the years the conference has witnessed notable representatives from various global institutions like WIPO, UNODC, OECD, INTERPOL, WCO, UKIPO, USPTO, US Department of Homeland Security, Australian Border Force, among others who have collaborated with this initiative, demonstrating their commitment to address this global challenge.

MASCRADE which is now being held for over a decade now has garnered significant delegate interest, extensive media coverage, and featured a diverse lineup of eminent speakers from across the globe. The ensuing reports and recommendations are also shared with policymakers at the highest levels.

MASCRADE 2022 is set to feature an impressive lineup of distinguished speakers from renowned global organisations, including WCO, WIPO, UNODC, INCB-UN, INTERPOL and JETRO.

It will also have addresses by Indian policy makers and senior government officials from Department of Revenue, Directorate of Enforcement, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, and Financial Intelligence Unit.

Moreover, subject matter experts from several countries, including Denmark, Italy, France, and Belgium, and eminent professionals in areas such as cyber law, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce, will contribute their valuable insights during the conference.

Additionally, Prominent corporations such as ITC, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Kenvue, and RealNetworks India will also actively participate in the event.

At the conference, FICCI CASCADE and the Thought Arbitrage Research Institute (TARI) will unveil a comprehensive report titled 'Hidden Streams: Linkages between Illicit Markets, Financial Flows, Organised Crime, and Terrorism.'

This report will examine and reveal the concealed connections between smuggling and the funding of criminal activities and terrorism. It will also address the repercussions on the socio-economic structure of nations and present a roadmap for the future to tackle the issue.

Anil Rajput, Chairman, FICCI CASCADE said: “The intricate interplay between illicit markets, financial flows, organised crime and terrorism weaves a complex web that presents a formidable challenge to the socio-economic stability of nations worldwide. During the 90th INTERPOL General Assembly held in India last year, our Prime Minister had said that money from illicit sources such as smuggling gets pushed into evil activities and becomes one of the major sources of terror funding. The theme of MASCRADE 2022 is inspired by his focus to eliminate such traffickers, smugglers, terrorists, or organised crime to protect our communities and economies. We are looking forward to an engaging and insightful event this year with an aim to create a comprehensive and actionable plan to combat illicit trade and its linkages to organised crime.”

A 2022 FICCI CASCADE study titled 'Illicit Markets: A Threat to Our National Interests' revealed a staggering 163 per cent increase in tax losses due to smuggling in India from 2010 to 2020. The government faced a substantial financial impact, with losses reaching Rs 58,521 crore, compared to Rs 22,230 crore, spanning crucial sectors such as alcoholic beverages, mobile phones, FMCG-household and personal goods, FMCG-packaged foods, and tobacco products. These industries collectively suffered an astounding 340 per cent surge in sales losses, escalating from Rs 59,046 crore in 2010 to Rs 2,60,094 crore in 2020, highlighting the gravity of the illicit trade issue.

Smuggling and counterfeiting threaten India's path to a 5 trillion-dollar economy, causing harm to industries, hampering job creation and impeding economic growth. Illicit trade presents a dual challenge - it not only deprives the government of tax revenue but also requires increased resource allocation for enforcement to curb such activities.

Like previous years, FICCI CASCADE will organise an Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Smuggling Awards and Felicitation Ceremony at MASCRADE 2022 to honour select enforcement officers, school children and journalists for their efforts towards countering illicit trade.

2022-09-22, Investing.com,Amazon to host another Prime Big Deal Days in October after successful sales in previous quarters,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-to-host-another-prime-big-deal-days-in-october-after-successful-sales-in-previous-quarters-93CH-3820818,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is set to host a two-day shopping event, ""Prime Big Deal Days"", starting October 10, 2022. This announcement comes a little over two months after its last Prime Day sale and over a month before the Black Friday weekend. The event is a continuation of Amazon's commitment to providing member-exclusive shopping events with significant discounts.

The upcoming event follows the company's previous ""Prime Early Access Sale"", which was held in October last year. During these events, new deals appear as often as every five minutes at certain times, and members are encouraged to register for exclusive lists that offer special deals on selected products.

These Prime Day events have historically driven sales growth for Amazon. The inaugural ""Prime Early Access Sale"", held on October 11 and 12, 2022, marked an improvement in inventory conditions and showcased innovative approaches to discounting products to stimulate sales.

Last year's Prime Early Access Sale surpassed management's expectations, as highlighted by Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky during their fourth-quarter earnings call. Moreover, Amazon's Prime Day event in July was noted for its record-breaking first-day sales.

The e-commerce giant has been experiencing a gradual acceleration in revenue growth over recent quarters. Following an 8.5% year-over-year increase in Q4 2022, revenue rose by 9.4% in Q1 2022 and 10.8% in Q2 2022. This upward trend was largely driven by the company's e-commerce segment, where sales growth improved from 2% in Q4 2022 to 3% and 5% in Q1 and Q2 2022, respectively.

Analysts forecast this growth momentum will continue into the second half of the year, predicting an average revenue increase of 11.4% in Q3 and 11.6% in Q4. Given Amazon's track record with sales events, these estimates may prove to be conservative, particularly considering the company's current trend of accelerating growth.

While the upcoming shopping event is not expected to significantly alter Amazon's long-term stock performance, it remains a crucial factor in driving the company's accelerating revenue trends. As such, investors should consider the stock's value independently of the event but also recognize the potential boost that Prime Big Deal Days could provide to Amazon's top-line growth.

Initially, the ad integration will be introduced in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada, with France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia following later in the year. The move comes as part of Amazon's strategy to sustain investment in high-quality content amid intense competition among streaming platforms.

Prime subscribers in the U.S. will be given the choice to maintain an ad-free service for an additional $2.99 per month. The pricing for ad-free programming in countries outside the U.S. will be disclosed at a later date. Amazon has confirmed that there are no plans to change the price of Prime membership next year.

The decision by Amazon follows a trend set by other streaming platforms diversifying their subscription levels to balance fresh content generation and subscriber retention against potential losses due to price increases. For instance, Disney intends to launch a $13.99 monthly subscription for its ad-free Disney+ service starting mid-October in the U.S., a 75% increase from its ad-supported tier. Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s ad-free plan is currently priced at $15.49 per month, over double the cost of its ad-inclusive subscription.

Before introducing advertisements into its programming, Amazon plans to notify U.S. Prime members several weeks in advance via email, offering information on how to opt for the ad-free service if desired.

Despite these changes, live events on Amazon Prime, such as sports already feature advertising. The limited advertisements during shows and movies starting next year are part of a broader strategy to facilitate continued investment in high-quality content.

(NASDAQ: ) revealed its intention on Friday to incorporate advertising into its Prime Video streaming service in 2024, a strategy that aligns with the industry's trend of leveraging ads for additional revenue. The company announced that the advertising would be initially introduced in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada, with other markets to follow in due course.

The tech giant also plans to offer an ad-free option for U.S. Prime members at an additional cost of $2.99 per month. The pricing structure for other countries will be defined at a later date.

According to Amazon's statement, the number of advertisements on its platform will be significantly fewer than those on linear TV and other online streaming providers. The ad-supported Prime Video in the U.S. will cost $14.99 per month or $139 annually, which includes the standard Prime membership fee, plus an extra $2.99 per month for ad-free streaming. This price is exclusive of any discount offers.

In comparison, Netflix Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) subscription plans include a $6.99 per month ad-supported plan, a $15.49 ad-free standard plan, and a premium plan priced at $19.99 that provides more simultaneous streams and improved video quality.

In August, Disney+ announced plans for an ad-supported service, while Netflix launched its ""basic with ads"" streaming plan last year. Prime members in the UK, the US, Germany and Canada will begin seeing advertisements early next year unless they pay an additional fee for an ""ad-free"" option.

""We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required for Prime members.

2022-09-22, Investing.com,Ads are coming to Amazon Prime Video next year; stock pops,https://in.investing.com/news/ads-are-coming-to-amazon-prime-video-next-year-stock-pops-432SI-3820112,"Ads will be introduced to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video's entertainment content, including movies and series, in several countries, the company announced today.

The rollout is set to begin in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Canada in early 2024, with additional countries like France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Australia getting ads later in the year.

Amazon shares rose 1.3% in early Friday trade.

Previously, Prime Video viewers experienced ads during exclusive broadcasts of Thursday Night Football. Now, these commercial breaks will expand to non-sports content on the platform.

Amazon has stated that the ad load will be ""limited,” which suggests that Amazon is cautious about not overwhelming viewers with advertising within its streaming service.

“We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers,” the company said in a blog post.

Amazon Prime members who have enjoyed ad-free access to Prime Video content as part of their membership will face an additional fee starting next year. The new fee, set at $2.99 per month in the U.S., will be required for Prime members who wish to continue watching Prime Video content without ads.

Meanwhile, the monthly Prime membership cost will remain unchanged for those who are willing to watch content with ads.

Amazon states that introducing ads to Prime Video will enable the company to continue investing in content and potentially increase its content investments over time."
2022-09-22, Investing.com,Overstock faces challenges following Bed Bath & Beyond rebranding,https://in.investing.com/news/overstock-faces-challenges-following-bed-bath--beyond-rebranding-93CH-3819557,"Overstock.com (NASDAQ: ), the online furniture liquidator, is experiencing a significant drop in stock value following its rebranding to Bed Bath & Beyond (OTC: ), despite initial investor enthusiasm. The company purchased Bed Bath & Beyond's brand and intellectual property for $21.5 million in June 2022 and officially implemented the name change on August 1.

Following the acquisition announcement, Overstock's stock surged 76% due to positive investor sentiment. However, this enthusiasm has since waned, with the stock plummeting 52% from August 1 to Thursday. A September 6 update on the company's corporate identity transition revealed smaller than anticipated improvements in web traffic and active customer numbers, contributing to the decline.

Despite Bed Bath & Beyond's brand carrying advantages such as higher brand awareness and a stronger association with home goods, it also has drawbacks. The brand has experienced a period of decline which may have negatively impacted its value. Additionally, Overstock now faces stiff competition from retail giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Walmart (NYSE: ), and Target who offer services like same-day delivery or in-store pickup options that Overstock does not provide.

These competitors also have the capacity to undercut Overstock’s prices. While Bed Bath’s prices are currently competitive, this could be affecting profit margins as the company attempts to reposition itself in a saturated market.

In an attempt to regain customer loyalty, Overstock initiated a promotional campaign. The company estimates that Bed Bath had nearly 20 million active customers in its last year of operation, half of whom made at least one online purchase in the past year. At its peak, Bed Bath had nearly 40 million shoppers.

However, these efforts might weigh on profitability in the short term. There are concerns that customer acquisition will be slower than Overstock anticipates, potentially extending the investment phase beyond the expected few quarters.

Despite these challenges, Overstock's strong balance sheet and solid cash reserves may help it weather the storm. The company is expected to become more efficient with its marketing expenses over time. While Overstock has inherited a well-known brand that could drive long-term growth, it has also inherited some of Bed Bath & Beyond's significant challenges. Only time will reveal how these factors will balance out.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Oracle reasserts $65 billion revenue forecast for 2026 despite recent setbacks,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-reasserts-65-billion-revenue-forecast-for-2026-despite-recent-setbacks-93CH-3819242,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ). has reaffirmed its yearly revenue projection of $65 billion by the fiscal year 2026, a forecast initially shared with investors a year ago. This reassertion comes despite recent quarterly results that left some investors disappointed. Oracle's Executive Vice President, Doug Kehring, restated these projections at the company's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday. He expressed confidence in reaching the stated revenue goal, maintaining a 45% operating margin by fiscal 2026, and achieving an over 10% annual increase in earnings per share.

The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its cloud-computing rental business, an area where it has historically lagged behind competitors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.’s Google. However, investor optimism has been growing as Oracle's cloud services are believed to have the potential to grow rapidly and meet the high-demand computing needs of artificial intelligence products.

Kehring emphasized that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which generated $5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending May 2022, is targeting Google. However, this revenue represented only about 10% of Oracle's total income.

Investor enthusiasm was dampened last week when Oracle reported a 30% increase in cloud sales for the quarter, compared to a 54% surge in the previous period. This announcement led to a nearly 14% drop in Oracle's shares, marking the largest single-day decline in over two decades and pulling them down from an all-time peak.

Ahead of Thursday's event, many analysts anticipated that Oracle would maintain its outlook. To reach its target, the company needs to sustain an average annual sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the next three fiscal years.

However, given the recent slowdown in Oracle's electronic health records division Cerner (NASDAQ: ), which it acquired last year, and the ongoing shift to cloud services, some analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana, believe this to be a challenging endeavor.

On Thursday, Oracle's shares fell by 2.8% to $109.65 at 3:13 p.m. in New York. Despite last week's drop, the stock had risen by 38% this year through Wednesday's close.

The publication said it had seen documents confirming the move. The U-turn from the e-commerce giant suggests it is being more cautious about the amount of money it tries to pull from online sellers as it battles an escalating antitrust investigation.

In August, Amazon announced the 2% fee on merchants, stating it would take effect on October 1, although it was met with discontent from Amazon merchants and consultants. It was also seen as a ""brazen move since the US government is poised to file an antitrust lawsuit against the e-commerce giant,"" said Bloomberg.

They explained that the federal case is predicted to focus partly on Amazon's alleged efforts to push merchants into using its logistics services.

Bloomberg said an Amazon spokesperson emailed them, stating the 2% Seller Fulfilled Prime fee was intended to cover the company's costs, ""but after careful consideration,"" they've made the decision ""not to implement this program fee to ensure seller sentiment related to the fee does not impact program participation."""
2022-09-21, Investing.com,Tether invests $420M in GPU chips amid AI tech sector growth,https://in.investing.com/news/tether-invests-420m-in-gpu-chips-amid-ai-tech-sector-growth-93CH-3818566,"Renowned cryptocurrency firm Holdings has made a substantial strategic investment in the artificial intelligence (AI) tech sector, purchasing 10,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) H100 GPUs for $420 million. The acquisition was made through an Irish shell company, Damoon, on behalf of Northern Data, a German miner. This investment grants Tether a 20% stake in Northern Data, according to Forbes' report published earlier this week.

The transaction was necessitated by a chip scarcity that prevented Northern Data from directly securing the GPUs, which are highly sought after for their data processing capabilities essential in AI applications. Nvidia's GPUs are widely used in data centers and cloud computing applications, contributing to the company's market capitalization exceeding $1 trillion.

This move aligns with an ongoing trend among Bitcoin mining companies diversifying their revenue streams by venturing into the burgeoning AI industry. Companies like Coreweave have successfully transitioned from crypto mining to providing GPU-specialized cloud services, as acknowledged by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

The deal could potentially position Northern Data as one of Europe's largest cloud GPU operators, rivaling cloud computing giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Oracle (NYSE: ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). The company plans to rent out the GPUs to AI startups.

Despite the strategic investment, both Tether and Northern Data have faced controversies in the past. In 2022, Tether incurred a $21 million fine for misleading claims about its financials. On the other hand, Northern Data faced challenges with timely financial reporting and even had a criminal complaint filed by German regulators over inaccurate revenue reports.

Nevertheless, both companies continue to make significant strides in their respective sectors. Tether recently reported over $1 billion in profits for the last quarter and announced a $115 million share buyback. Meanwhile, Northern Data continues its pivot towards AI technology through this partnership with Tether.

Despite the gains, investor sentiment remained cautious due to concerns over the potential economic fallout of rates staying higher for longer. This follows Tuesday's selloff, which was fueled by uncertainty around the rates trajectory and concerns over the U.S. economy.

Gabriele Foà, Portfolio Manager at Algebris Investments, noted that the Fed's updated projections are likely to show one more hike in 2022, with an aim to stabilize inflation amidst higher growth in 2022/24. Recent economic data has suggested an easing in core inflation, fueling bets of a likely peak in interest rates. However, surging oil prices have impacted headline inflation figures, paving the way for the Federal Reserve to project higher-for-longer rates.

In response to these developments, financial markets have priced a 99% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged and a near 71% likelihood of standing pat in November, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

Meanwhile, marketing automation company Klaviyo made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The Boston-based company had secured a valuation of $9.2 billion in its initial public offering after pricing shares above their indicated range.

2022-09-20, Investing.com,"Amazon Unveils Next Generation Echo Show 8, All-New Echo Hub, and New Echo Frames",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-unveils-next-generation-echo-show-8-allnew-echo-hub-and-new-echo-frames-432SI-3817126,"(AMZN)—Amazon today introduced a range of new Echo devices designed for even more personalized, proactive, and intuitive Alexa experiences at home and on-the-go—the next-generation Echo Show 8, all-new Echo Hub, and new Echo Frames. In addition, Amazon collaborated with Safilo, one of the world’s leading eyewear manufacturers, to blend the power of Alexa with iconic Carrera designs.

“Engagement with Echo devices is at an all-time high,” said Daniel Rausch, vice president of Alexa and Fire TV. “Customers rely on Alexa for so much, including managing their smart homes, keeping up with the latest news, setting birthday reminders, and keeping their homes stocked with essentials. These new Echo devices give customers more ways to experience the world’s best personal AI—and the growing generative AI capabilities that will be coming to Alexa soon—at home and on the go.”

Echo Show 8—New Design, Spatial Audio, and Built-in Smart Home Hub—$149.99

The new Echo Show 8 has been upgraded inside and out. A new industrial design includes edge-to-edge glass and soft curvatures, while an improved processor delivers even faster display responses than the previous generation. It also runs a new model enabling Alexa to process common smart home requests locally for 40% faster responses to common requests, such as turning on a smart light, switch, or plug. An enhanced audio experience provides improved clarity and bass, with room adaptation technology and spatial audio processing for optimal, room-filling sound. Video calls are even better with a centered 13-megapixel camera, plus an enhanced audio pipeline which minimizes background noise from around the home. Additionally, a built-in smart home hub includes support for Zigbee, Sidewalk, Thread, Bluetooth, and Matter, enabling easy control of compatible lights, locks, and sensors.

All-new home screen experience with Adaptive Content

Echo Show 8 also features Adaptive Content—a new home screen experience that uses on-device computer vision technology to adjust on-screen content based on a customer’s proximity to the device. With this experience, a customer positioned across the room will see content that is easily viewed from a distance—such as a simplified news headline or recipe inspiration—with the screen automatically transitioning to a more detailed view as they approach the device. If the customer is enrolled in visual ID, the content will also be personalized to them, highlighting things like a recent playlist or additional news articles from their preferred provider. The new adaptive home screen also includes shortcut icons that make it easy to access their most used widgets, which can be opened with just a tap. Adaptive Content will be available on Echo Show 8 2nd and 3rd generation next month and roll out to other Echo Show devices early next year.

New Echo Show 8 Photos Edition enables customers to make personal photos the primary home screen content

Also coming this fall is Echo Show 8 Photos Edition, which unlocks a photo-forward mode on Echo Show 8’s high-resolution screen. The Photos Edition experience makes customer-selected personal photos the primary rotating content on the ambient screen. Photos rotate every 30-seconds and customers receive 25 GB of storage from Amazon Photos. Prime Members already receive free, unlimited high-resolution photo storage and can use this additional storage to back-up videos as well. The all-new Echo Show 8 Photos Edition is available for $159.99 and includes a six-month PhotosPlus subscription which will renew after six months for $1.99 per month, and can be cancelled at any time.

Echo Hub—Wall-Mountable Smart Home Control Panel—Just $179.99

The all-new Echo Hub is an Alexa-enabled smart home control panel, purpose-built to give customers a simple and intuitive way to manage smart home devices. It’s easy to install, and features a thin, eight-inch, touch-enabled display with a customizable smart home dashboard that makes it simple for customers to group and manage smart devices, arm a security system, start a Routine, organize widgets, and view multiple camera feeds. With Adaptive Content, Echo Hub uses infrared technology to detect when someone is nearby, and naturally transitions from a home screen with a beautiful clock, to the smart home control screen.

Easy to install, and includes built-in smart home hub

Echo Hub can be mounted on a wall or placed on a counter with a stand accessory, includes a built-in smart home hub with support for Zigbee, Sidewalk, Thread, Bluetooth, and Matter—and it’s compatible with more than 140,000 connected cameras, lights, locks, plugs, thermostats, speakers, and more. Echo Hub can connect to the internet wirelessly, or via ethernet with a compatible power-over-ethernet (PoE) adapter.

Echo Frames—Fashion-Forward Designs, Extended Battery Life, and Improved Audio—Starting at $269.99

The next-generation Echo Frames combine high-end fashion with Alexa on-the-go, with five new styles including sunglass, prescription-ready, or blue light lens options available. All frame styles have been designed with premium materials to be lightweight, with 15% slimmer temples for comfortable all-day wear, and improved battery life that delivers up to six hours of continuous media playback or talk time on a full charge. A redesigned audio architecture and new custom-built speakers deliver three-times more bass than the previous generation, and more accurately direct sound to customers’ ears, while minimizing outside noise. Plus, Echo Frames are built with upgraded speech processing technology that improves Alexa’s performance, with up to ten-times better recognition in loud or windy conditions than the previous generation. Now, customers can do more on-the-go, like calling a loved one, listening to a favorite playlist or podcast, or controlling smart home devices—all hands free.

Carrera Smart Glasses—the smarts of Alexa on the go, styled by Carrera Eyewear

Launching alongside the new Echo Frames are Carrera Smart Glasses—a completely new line of smart eyewear that combines Alexa with fashion-forward frame styles designed by Carrera Eyewear. The collection includes two new frame designs—Carrera Cruiser and Carrera Sprinter—blending the iconic Carrera style with the power of Alexa, allowing customers to stay connected and get help with daily tasks, with technology that blends seamlessly into their lifestyle when not in use.

Built with Privacy in Mind

Echo devices are designed with customer privacy in mind and include multiple layers of privacy controls. Echo devices include built-in camera shutters, a microphone on/off button and the microphones on Echo Frames and Carrera Smart Glasses can be muted with the double-press of a button. Customers have full control over their voice recordings and can view, hear, or delete them at any time.

This decision comes in the wake of indicators suggesting a decline in core inflation from recent economic data. However, rising oil prices have impacted headline inflation figures, leading to speculation that the Fed may predict sustained higher rates.

The updated forecasts from the Fed are anticipated to include an additional rate increase in 2022 and improved growth for 2022/24. The aim is to stabilize inflation, but these predictions have created uncertainty regarding the trajectory of rates and potential economic impacts. This led to a market selloff on Tuesday, which was further exacerbated by a spike in Canada's inflation rate due to elevated gasoline prices and a larger-than-expected decrease in U.S. housing starts.

Financial markets have factored in a 99% likelihood that the Fed will keep rates steady and a 69% probability of no change in November, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.

In related market movements, were up by 48 points (0.14%), were up by 6.5 points (0.14%), and were up by 22.75 points (0.15%) as of early Wednesday morning.

A pullback in U.S. Treasury yields from their 2007 highs has helped megacap growth stocks record gains. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) saw increases ranging from 0.2% to 0.3%. On the other hand, Dollar General (NYSE: ) shares fell by 2.2% following J.P.Morgan's downgrade from ""neutral"" to ""underweight"".

In other financial news unrelated to the Federal Reserve or market movements, Klaviyo, a marketing automation company, is expected to make its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This follows the firm's successful initial public offering (IPO), pricing its share sale above the indicated range and achieving a valuation of $9.2 billion. Meanwhile, Instacart shares fell by 3.9% in premarket trading after a 12% rise in their debut on Tuesday. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) also experienced a decrease, with a 1.4% loss in value.

A diverse range of roles—from packing and picking to sorting and shipping—are available to applicants from all backgrounds and experience levels. The flexibility of jobs available come with a wide range of hours—full- and part-time—and excellent pay and benefits. Interested candidates can see hiring locations and open positions at amazon.com/apply.

“The holiday season is always a special time at Amazon and we’re excited to hire 250,000 additional people this year to help serve customers across the country,” said John Felton, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. “Whether someone is looking for a short-term way to make extra money, or is hoping to take their first step toward a fulfilling and rewarding career at Amazon, there’s a role available for them. A fulfillment or transportation employee who starts with us today will see a 13% increase in pay over the next three years—likely more, including our annual wage investments—and that’s on top of offerings like pre-paid college tuition with Career Choice and heath care benefits on day one.”

Jobs in Amazon’s operations network include stowing, picking, packing, sorting, shipping customer orders, and more, and are available in hundreds of cities and towns across America. These roles can be the start of a long-term career inside or outside the company.

“I applied for a seasonal role and really enjoyed the culture and community, so I moved into a full-time position in operations,” explained Samantha Wolfe, Amazon employee based in the Inland Empire. “I was accepted into Amazon’s apprenticeship program, where I graduated and now have a career in marketing. My experience is a testament to the company's investment in its employees—and I am so thankful for the opportunities Amazon has given me.”

In 2022, Amazon has added many new benefits, including a new emergency savings program and a financial assistance pilot program that has helped save hourly employees nearly $20 million—all available from day one of employment. This week, Amazon also shared its latest investment and economic impact data for California from its 2022 Economic Impact Report provided by Keystone Strategy, a third-party consultancy.

Key findings from the report show that since 2010:

Amazon has invested $142 billion in California, including infrastructure and compensation to employees.

The company has created more than 160,000 direct jobs in California.

These investments support an additional 311,000 indirect jobs across the state, in fields like construction and professional services.

Amazon has contributed $135 billion to the state GDP, on top of the company’s direct investments.

“We’re proud to see how our investments are able to unlock new economic opportunity for millions of people across the U.S.,” said Holly Sullivan, vice president of Worldwide Economic Development at Amazon. “We’re providing jobs with competitive pay and great benefits, including free upskilling opportunities. We see every day how our investments have positive downstream effects for so many local economies, from big cities to small towns. Whether it’s at a fulfillment center, delivery station, corporate office, or retail store, every job created is an example of Amazon’s economic engine at work.”

Amazon has opened over 50 new fulfillment centers, delivery stations, and same-day delivery sites in the U.S. this year, resulting in hundreds or thousands of new job opportunities per site, depending on the size and location.

Amazon provides career advancement opportunities, earned pay access, health, vision, and dental insurance from the first day on the job; a 401(k) with company match; up to 20 weeks paid parental leave with 6 weeks for supporting parents; and Amazon’s Resources for Living program, a free benefit offering mental health and financial services and support for employees, their families, and their households."
2022-09-19, Investing.com,'Tech stocks rip higher into year-end' say Wedbush analysts,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-stocks-rip-higher-into-yearend-say-wedbush-analysts-432SI-3815066,"Wedbush analysts said in a note Tuesday that the firm expects a tech rally to gain legs into the year-end despite Federal Reserve/10-year fears.

The analysts believe that the Street is ""now starting to get a better grasp on what appears to be a stable and slightly improving IT spending environment"" heading into year-end and 2024.

""Our recent incrementally positive enterprise IT checks in the field reinforce our thesis that a modestly improving IT spending environment in 3Q on the heels of this '1995-like AI Revolution' creates a bullish set up for tech stocks into year-end and 2024,"" they wrote.

As a result, the analysts said the firm believes ""tech stocks rip higher into year-end,"" with a new tech bull market here despite the near-term focus on the Fed. In addition, Wedbush thinks the Fed is ""starting to finally wave the white flag,"" with rate cuts on the horizon in 2024.

The firm is focusing on tech growth led by AI. However, while they don't see Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), among others, experiencing growth like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) in this quarter, they do feel the ""rocket ship-like trajectory of AI-driven growth"" will hit the shores of the tech industry over the next 12 to 18 months."
2022-09-19, Investing.com,"China's economic recovery impact on S&P 500 limited, investors remain cautious",https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-economic-recovery-impact-on-sp-500-limited-investors-remain-cautious-93CH-3814598,"The ongoing economic recovery in China may not significantly impact the , despite its sluggish pace. This was reported on Monday, suggesting that Chinese operations contribute to merely 5% of the total revenue of companies listed in the S&P 500, according to Scott Chronert from Citi.

Chronert further pointed out that a total loss of revenue from China would result in about a 7% decrease in the S&P 500 earnings, a substantial but not disastrous scenario. A 5% reduction in revenue from China would lead to a slight 0.3% decline in earnings-per-share (EPS) for the index. If half of all revenue from China were eliminated, the S&P 500 EPS would drop by approximately 3.4%.

However, investors are advised to stay vigilant as a slowdown in China could potentially cause future problems. This is particularly relevant for companies with significant weightings in the index, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). These seven major companies earn more than 10% of their revenue from China. Therefore, while the overall risk to the index is relatively minor, there might be pockets of risk and volatility if there's a significant slowdown in China.

Certain industries like tech, autos, household products, and pharma have a higher-than-average exposure to China which could lead to an unstable profit outlook. Furthermore, some U.S. businesses are at an even greater risk as they derive over 30% of their revenue from China. These include Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: ), Aptiv (NYSE: ), Estée Lauder, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ: )., Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ).

Despite recent positive news about Chinese retail sales and industrial production, investors remain cautious. In August alone, foreign investors withdrew nearly $15 billion from Chinese stocks. While U.S. stocks have so far avoided the volatility experienced by offshore Chinese counterparts this year due to hopes of economic recovery, companies with substantial China exposure may continue to be viewed as less attractive by some investors.

The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain rates at 5.25% to 5.5% during its meeting on Wednesday, with nearly a 70% likelihood for another pause in November according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) strategists noted a clear distinction between European rate hikes and an anticipated pause from the Federal Reserve that aligns with earlier decisions made by Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia. They highlighted a common message across central banks guiding towards a 'high for long' pause.

In other news, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) suggested a portfolio of defensive growth is suitable for a ""late cycle"" trading market. Russell 'Rusty' Delroy, founder and investment manager of boutique Cottesloe firm Nero Resources Fund, expressed confidence in the oil and gas sector, citing a severe misalignment between company valuations, investor sentiment, and actual supply-demand metrics.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Instacart achieves $9.9 billion valuation in successful IPO,https://in.investing.com/news/instacart-achieves-99-billion-valuation-in-successful-ipo-93CH-3814498,"Grocery delivery app Instacart, owned by Maplebear Inc, has successfully priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its indicated range, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $9.9 billion. The shares are set to start trading on NASDAQ on Tuesday. The IPO raised $660 million, with the company pricing it at $30 per share following strong investor demand.

This valuation is notably lower than the $39 billion valuation that investors assigned to Instacart during a private fundraising round in March 2021, amidst the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic-induced surge in demand for grocery delivery services tapering off, Instacart has proven its profitability. The company reported a net income of $242 million for the six months ended June 30, compared to a loss of $74 million in the same period last year.

Investors such as Norges Bank Investment Management and entities affiliated with venture capital firms TCV, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and Valiant Capital Management have agreed to buy up to $400 million worth of shares sold in Instacart's IPO. Beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) also agreed to purchase $175 million in preferred convertible stock.

Despite facing competition from retail giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Target, and Walmart (NYSE: ), Instacart continues to generate revenue by delivering groceries from various chains including Kroger (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ), and Wegmans. The company has also expanded its delivery business to non-grocery goods from sellers such as beauty product retailer Sephora, convenience store 7-Eleven and pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE: ).

The company's successful IPO is seen as another sign of the U.S. IPO market's rebound after a dry spell throughout most of this year and 2022. This follows SoftBank (TYO: ) Group Corp's chip designer Arm floating on last week at a $54.5 billion fully diluted valuation, which has since risen to $62 billion after three days of trading.

2022-09-19, IANS,Microsoft’s Panos Panay ‘heading’ to Amazon to run its hardware business,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-panos-panay-heading-to-amazon-to-run-its-hardware-business-3814368,"San Francisco, Sep 19 (IANS) Panos Panay, Microsoft’s former Windows and Surface chief, is reportedly joining Amazon (NASDAQ: ) to oversee its hardware business.Panay is taking over from Dave Limp, Amazon’s outgoing head of Amazon devices and services who has been with the company for nearly 14 years, reports said on Tuesday.

Last month, Limp confirmed he is stepping down. Under his leadership, Amazon became one of the world’s leading innovators in building devices and underlying services that customers love.

His departure came amid reports that Amazon’s costly bet on smart home devices has not paid off well.

“From Kindle readers to Fire TV to Alexa and Echo, over the past decade and a half we’ve been able to invent and keep improving experiences that help make our customers’ lives better every day,” according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.

Panay is likely to run Amazon’s division for its Alexa and Echo speakers.

He joined Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in 2004 as a group programme manager and became the company’s chief product officer in 2018, where he led the development of Windows 11.

In 2021, Panay was promoted to executive vice president as part of the top leadership team under Microsoft Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella.

Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of modern life, search, and devices, will take his place as the head of the Windows and Surface businesses.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Leading U.S. banks set to launch 'Paze', a mobile wallet in response to tech giants",https://in.investing.com/news/leading-us-banks-set-to-launch-paze-a-mobile-wallet-in-response-to-tech-giants-93CH-3813153,"In the latest development in the ongoing competition between traditional banking institutions and tech giants, major American banks are preparing to introduce a mobile wallet, Paze, which will connect directly with the credit and debit card accounts of 150 million customers. The app, scheduled for launch next year, is a collective effort by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), and others. Early Warning Services, which operates the payment app Zelle, will manage Paze.

This move marks a significant shift in strategy for these banking giants. Previously, they believed they could individually compete against Big Tech and emerging fintech startups. However, the rise of tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the financial services sector has led these banks to reconsider their approach.

Over recent years, JPMorgan Chase has partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple to expand their banking services. In a similar vein, Citi has inked a deal to finance Amazon's installment payment offering. This trend is not just confined to the United States. In Europe, Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) is exploring partnerships with fintech companies, while Orange's banking division in France has made deals with fintechs Younited and Mambu for digital lending and online banking platforms respectively.

Nevertheless, these collaborations have not been without regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential risks these partnerships could pose to banks and the wider U.S. banking system.

The mobile wallet market has become a key area of competition between banks and tech companies. Banks have traditionally dominated consumer payments but the rise of Apple Pay has challenged this dominance. While Apple does not disclose official usage statistics for its mobile wallet, it is reported that over 500 million users have adopted Apple Pay in just five years.

In hopes of emulating their success with Zelle - which since its 2017 launch has become the largest peer-to-peer payment app with transactions totaling $629 billion last year - banks are launching Paze. Yet, the handling of fraud cases involving Zelle has drawn criticism towards these banks.

The success of Paze will largely rely on banks' willingness to allow it to connect directly to customers' bank accounts, giving it a potential advantage over Apple Pay. The Paze team recently recruited Cameron Fowler, a top executive from BMO Financial Group, as its next CEO. However, details about Paze's functionality and whether users will be able to access their account information through the app remain limited.

With tech companies continuing to expand their financial services offerings and banks striving to maintain their market share, the future of the financial services industry remains uncertain.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: Arm's big debut, Apple's new iPhone, Qualcomm's Apple pact, Oracle's disappointment, and an AI-driven Tesla upgrade.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""

""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.

For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:

""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL? No. We continue to believe that the three legs of growth either still have much to go (SaaS), are at a very early stage (OCI), or are only just beginning (On Prem database migration to the Cloud). We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

2022-09-16, IANS,Amazon hires Spyglass and Universal Studios veteran to heads its MGM acquisition venture,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-hires-spyglass-and-universal-studios-veteran-to-heads-its-mgm-acquisition-venture-3812309,"Los Angeles, Sep 17 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) MGM Studios has grabbed veteran Peter Oillataguerre from Spyglass to make him its Head of Feature Film Production. Oillataguerre is taking on the newly created role of head of feature film production for Amazon MGM Studios, Hollywood Reporter reported.

The highly rated executive, who comes from Spyglass, will report to Dan Scharf, head of global business operations, and is expected to work closely with head of film, streaming and theatrical Courtenay Valenti and the company's film teams as the newly B2B home delivery to films ventures seeks to expand its footprint in the entertainment industry and Hollywood.

""Peter brings with him more than 20 years of industry experience. He is a veteran executive with tremendous expertise in the world of production. In his new Avatar, he will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the feature film production cycle for the Amazon MGM Studios film group,"" Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, wrote in an email to staff on Friday.

At Spyglass, Oillataguerre worked on films such as 'Scream', 'Hellraiser' and 'The Upside', and also worked on TV series 'Project Runway'. Prior to Spyglass, he worked at Universal Studios and MGM Studios, with projects, including James Bond features 'Skyfall' and 'No Time to Die', as well as 'Creed'.

Amazon gave Ben Affleck’s 'Air' a global theatrical release, considered significant as streamers had been reluctant to grant traditional releases to their properties previously. The studio has multiple titles due out later this year, including 'Totally Killer' streaming on October 6. It is giving Emerald Fennell's festival feature 'Saltburn' a limited release on November 24, Hollywood Reporter said.

Amazon acquired MGM Studios for a record $8.45 billion, making it its bold B2B deal and foray into the entertainment industry, thus turbocharging its streaming ambitions, considered its second biggest deal after it acquired Whole Foods grocery chain in the US. The deal is the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history, behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.

Amazon hopes to leverage MGM's storied filmmaking history and wide-ranging catalog of 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to help bolster Amazon Studios, its film and TV division. Prime Video watchers would now be able to watch a richer fare of movies and TV serials across the globe as Amazon expands its footprint in the show business, as it competes fiercely with HBO, Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney Hulu OTT platforms.

Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, had called the deal then clinched way back in 2021 as: ""It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.""

In a statement, MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich had then said: ""The opportunity to align MGM's storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.""

Amazon shares barely moved up on the merger announcement then in the New York Stock Exchange.

2022-09-20, Investing.com,Amazon Introduces Its Most Powerful Fire TV Sticks Ever and Unveils Generative AI Updates for Fire TV,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-introduces-its-most-powerful-fire-tv-sticks-ever-and-unveils-generative-ai-updates-for-fire-tv-432SI-3817129,"(AMZN)—Today, Amazon announced a range of updates to its popular Fire TV family, introducing enhanced conversational voice search with generative AI, upgrades to the Fire TV Ambient Experience, and the most powerful Fire TV Sticks yet—the all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max, now with the Fire TV Ambient Experience, and Fire TV Stick 4K. In addition, Amazon announced the all-new Fire TV Soundbar, enabling customers to enjoy their favorite TV shows, movies, and games with room-filling sound.

""With a world of content at your fingertips, sometimes the hardest thing to do is decide what to watch. Fire TV has always been great at search, but generative AI takes it to a whole new level,” said Tapas Roy, vice president of Fire TV. “We've leveraged our new large language model to create a much more natural and conversational way to find content using natural dialogue. Simply ask Alexa nuanced or even open-ended questions about anything from genres and actors, to storylines and scenes, and enter a conversation that will find you something new based on what you like—even if you don’t know what you’re looking for.”

All-New Fire TV Stick 4K Max—Now with the Fire TV Ambient Experience, more speed, support for Wi-Fi 6E, and 2x the storage, for $59.99

The new Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the first streaming media player to come with the Fire TV Ambient Experience, and features an upgraded 2.0 GHz quad-core processor, making it Amazon’s smartest and most powerful streaming stick yet. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is the industry’s first streaming stick to include support for Wi-Fi 6E, meaning customers with a compatible router can enjoy the smoothest streaming experience with lower latency, faster speeds, and less interference from other Wi-Fi-enabled devices in the home.

With ultra-cinematic, vibrant 4K Ultra HD, and support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HDR10+, and immersive Dolby Atmos audio, the new Fire TV Stick 4K Max delivers Fire TV Stick’s best visual and audio experience yet. Fire TV Stick 4K Max also features 16GB of storage, doubling the previous generation’s capacity, and enabling customers to store even more apps and games directly on the device.

Fire TV Ambient Experience—Now available on the all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and upgraded with hundreds of new pieces of free artwork

Previously only available on the Fire TV Omni QLED Series, the Fire TV Ambient Experience transforms the TV into a beautiful, always-smart display, and is now available to more customers on the all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max.

With a quick tap of the Alexa button—or simply by asking Alexa—customers can activate the Ambient Experience from the Shortcuts menu and replace blank TV screens with helpful information and beautiful artwork. With the Ambient Experience, customers can see glance-able information like their Calendars and Reminders; leave Sticky Notes for family members; control smart devices like a thermostat or Ring doorbell; play audio from services like Amazon Music, Spotify, and others; and much more.

The Ambient Experience can also turn the TV into an in-home art gallery, with no monthly subscription required. Today, Amazon added hundreds of new images to a growing collection of more than 2,000 free, gallery-quality pieces of artwork, and expanded the collection to include artists from France, Spain, Italy, Japan, and Australia with art from notable institutions including Musée d'Orsay in Paris, Museo del Prado in Madrid, and Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Florence. Customers can choose from motion graphics, landscape art, personalized and always-evolving dynamic art, and personal photos.

Customers can also create artwork using just their voice with AI Art. This free feature, which will begin rolling out to customers in the U.S. by the end of this year, allows customers to easily generate a personalized background by giving Alexa an imagination-driven prompt, such as, “Alexa, create an image of cherry blossoms in the snow,” and watch as that prompt is translated into a unique display on the Fire TV screen. Coming next year, customers will also be able to display a personal photo from Amazon Photos, and even transform the image into a popular art style, like sepia tone or a watercolor painting.

All-New Fire TV Stick 4K—Faster, more fluid 4K streaming for under $50

The new Fire TV Stick 4K delivers Fire TV Stick’s best performance yet for under $50. It introduces support for Wi-Fi 6 and features an updated 1.7 GHZ quad-core processor, making it nearly 30% more powerful than the previous generation. Customers can enjoy vibrant 4K Ultra HD picture quality and immersive Dolby Atmos audio with support for Dolby Vision, HDR, HLG, and HDR10+. Plus, with Alexa Home Theater, customers can wirelessly connect compatible Echo devices, for audio across multiple speakers and inputs.

Fire TV Experience Updates—A new, delightful, and conversational way to find and discover content with generative AI

The upgraded Fire TV experience materially enhances search, browse, and recommendations by combining generative AI with Fire TV's extensive entertainment content and app library—enabling customers to find and discover content in a natural, contextual, and conversational way. Customers will be able to ask Alexa nuanced or open-ended questions about TV shows and movies, helping them find what they’re looking for using natural and conversational language. Customers can ask Alexa to find content based on specific actors, directors, scenes, genres, or entitlements such as “action movies with car chases,” “comedies for a rainy day inside,” or “animated movies that are free to me.” Customers can also simply tell Alexa what they are in the mood to watch, and choose from a selection of recommendations personalized to their Fire TV profiles.

In addition to generative AI in voice search, a new “Continue Watching” row will include content from leading streaming entertainment providers including Amazon Freevee, Disney+, Hulu, Max, MGM+, Peacock, STARZ, and Tubi. The new row puts recently watched content front and center, with a focus on recency, making it easy for customers to find and stream their favorite content. Fire TV will continue to add content from streaming providers over time. The generative AI-powered voice search and new “Continue Watching” row will roll out to customers in the U.S. later this year.

New Fire TV Device Bundle—Access thousands of movies and original series with six months of MGM+, on Amazon

U.S. customers who purchase a new Fire TV streaming media player or smart TV on Amazon or in retail stores can enjoy a six-month subscription to MGM+ at no additional charge. With MGM+, customers can watch thousands of movies from MGM and other major Hollywood studios, including Top Gun: Maverick, No Time to Die, House of Gucci, plus original series, including the sci-fi horror hit FROM, Emmy-winning Godfather of Harlem, and the Western adventure Billy the Kid.

All-New Fire TV Soundbar—Bold sound, easy setup, and a compact design, for $119.99

Sustainable Design

The all-new Fire TV Stick 4K Max, Fire TV Stick 4K, and Fire TV Soundbar carry the Climate Pledge Friendly badge by achieving the Carbon Trust’s Reducing CO2 certifications.

A new industrial design includes edge-to-edge glass and soft curvatures, while an improved processor delivers even faster display responses than the previous generation. It also runs a new model enabling Alexa to process common smart home requests locally for 40% faster responses to common requests, such as turning on a smart light, switch, or plug. An enhanced audio experience provides improved clarity and bass, with room adaptation technology and spatial audio processing for optimal, room-filling sound. Video calls are even better with a centered 13-megapixel camera, plus an enhanced audio pipeline which minimizes background noise from around the home.

Easy to install, and includes built-in smart home hub

Echo Hub can be mounted on a wall or placed on a counter with a stand accessory, includes a built-in smart home hub with support for Zigbee, Sidewalk, Thread, Bluetooth, and Matter—and it’s compatible with more than 140,000 connected cameras, lights, locks, plugs, thermostats, speakers, and more.

This decision comes in the wake of indicators suggesting a decline in core inflation from recent economic data. However, rising oil prices have impacted headline inflation figures, leading to speculation that the Fed may predict sustained higher rates.

The updated forecasts from the Fed are anticipated to include an additional rate increase in 2022 and improved growth for 2022/24. The aim is to stabilize inflation, but these predictions have created uncertainty regarding the trajectory of rates and potential economic impacts. This led to a market selloff on Tuesday, which was further exacerbated by a spike in Canada's inflation rate due to elevated gasoline prices and a larger-than-expected decrease in U.S. housing starts.

Financial markets have factored in a 99% likelihood that the Fed will keep rates steady and a 69% probability of no change in November, according to the CME's FedWatch tool.

In related market movements, were up by 48 points (0.14%), were up by 6.5 points (0.14%), and were up by 22.75 points (0.15%) as of early Wednesday morning.

A pullback in U.S. Treasury yields from their 2007 highs has helped megacap growth stocks record gains. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) saw increases ranging from 0.2% to 0.3%. On the other hand, Dollar General (NYSE: ) shares fell by 2.2% following J.P.Morgan's downgrade from ""neutral"" to ""underweight"".

In other financial news unrelated to the Federal Reserve or market movements, Klaviyo, a marketing automation company, is expected to make its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This follows the firm's successful initial public offering (IPO), pricing its share sale above the indicated range and achieving a valuation of $9.2 billion. Meanwhile, Instacart shares fell by 3.9% in premarket trading after a 12% rise in their debut on Tuesday. Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) also experienced a decrease, with a 1.4% loss in value.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,"Amazon Hiring 250,000 Employees Throughout the US",https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/amazon-hiring-250000-employees-throughout-the-us-432SI-3815385,"Amazon (AMZN) today announced that it is hiring 250,000 employees throughout the U.S. in full-time, seasonal, and part-time roles across its operations network, and 30,000 of those will be across California. A diverse range of roles—from packing and picking to sorting and shipping—are available to applicants from all backgrounds and experience levels. The flexibility of jobs available come with a wide range of hours—full- and part-time—and excellent pay and benefits. Interested candidates can see hiring locations and open positions at amazon.com/apply.

“The holiday season is always a special time at Amazon and we’re excited to hire 250,000 additional people this year to help serve customers across the country,” said John Felton, Amazon’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations. “Whether someone is looking for a short-term way to make extra money, or is hoping to take their first step toward a fulfilling and rewarding career at Amazon, there’s a role available for them. A fulfillment or transportation employee who starts with us today will see a 13% increase in pay over the next three years—likely more, including our annual wage investments—and that’s on top of offerings like pre-paid college tuition with Career Choice and heath care benefits on day one.”

Jobs in Amazon’s operations network include stowing, picking, packing, sorting, shipping customer orders, and more, and are available in hundreds of cities and towns across America. These roles can be the start of a long-term career inside or outside the company.

“I applied for a seasonal role and really enjoyed the culture and community, so I moved into a full-time position in operations,” explained Samantha Wolfe, Amazon employee based in the Inland Empire. “I was accepted into Amazon’s apprenticeship program, where I graduated and now have a career in marketing. My experience is a testament to the company's investment in its employees—and I am so thankful for the opportunities Amazon has given me.”

In 2022, Amazon has added many new benefits, including a new emergency savings program and a financial assistance pilot program that has helped save hourly employees nearly $20 million—all available from day one of employment. This week, Amazon also shared its latest investment and economic impact data for California from its 2022 Economic Impact Report provided by Keystone Strategy, a third-party consultancy.

Key findings from the report show that since 2010:

Amazon has invested $142 billion in California, including infrastructure and compensation to employees.

The company has created more than 160,000 direct jobs in California.

These investments support an additional 311,000 indirect jobs across the state, in fields like construction and professional services.

Amazon has contributed $135 billion to the state GDP, on top of the company’s direct investments.

“We’re proud to see how our investments are able to unlock new economic opportunity for millions of people across the U.S.,” said Holly Sullivan, vice president of Worldwide Economic Development at Amazon. “We’re providing jobs with competitive pay and great benefits, including free upskilling opportunities. We see every day how our investments have positive downstream effects for so many local economies, from big cities to small towns. Whether it’s at a fulfillment center, delivery station, corporate office, or retail store, every job created is an example of Amazon’s economic engine at work.”

Amazon has opened over 50 new fulfillment centers, delivery stations, and same-day delivery sites in the U.S. this year, resulting in hundreds or thousands of new job opportunities per site, depending on the size and location.

Amazon provides career advancement opportunities, earned pay access, health, vision, and dental insurance from the first day on the job; a 401(k) with company match; up to 20 weeks paid parental leave with 6 weeks for supporting parents; and Amazon’s Resources for Living program, a free benefit offering mental health and financial services and support for employees, their families, and their households."
2022-09-19, Investing.com,'Tech stocks rip higher into year-end' say Wedbush analysts,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-stocks-rip-higher-into-yearend-say-wedbush-analysts-432SI-3815066,"Wedbush analysts said in a note Tuesday that the firm expects a tech rally to gain legs into the year-end despite Federal Reserve/10-year fears.

The analysts believe that the Street is ""now starting to get a better grasp on what appears to be a stable and slightly improving IT spending environment"" heading into year-end and 2024.

""Our recent incrementally positive enterprise IT checks in the field reinforce our thesis that a modestly improving IT spending environment in 3Q on the heels of this '1995-like AI Revolution' creates a bullish set up for tech stocks into year-end and 2024,"" they wrote.

As a result, the analysts said the firm believes ""tech stocks rip higher into year-end,"" with a new tech bull market here despite the near-term focus on the Fed. In addition, Wedbush thinks the Fed is ""starting to finally wave the white flag,"" with rate cuts on the horizon in 2024.

The firm is focusing on tech growth led by AI. However, while they don't see Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), among others, experiencing growth like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) in this quarter, they do feel the ""rocket ship-like trajectory of AI-driven growth"" will hit the shores of the tech industry over the next 12 to 18 months."
2022-09-19, Investing.com,"China's economic recovery impact on S&P 500 limited, investors remain cautious",https://in.investing.com/news/chinas-economic-recovery-impact-on-sp-500-limited-investors-remain-cautious-93CH-3814598,"The ongoing economic recovery in China may not significantly impact the , despite its sluggish pace. This was reported on Monday, suggesting that Chinese operations contribute to merely 5% of the total revenue of companies listed in the S&P 500, according to Scott Chronert from Citi.

Chronert further pointed out that a total loss of revenue from China would result in about a 7% decrease in the S&P 500 earnings, a substantial but not disastrous scenario. A 5% reduction in revenue from China would lead to a slight 0.3% decline in earnings-per-share (EPS) for the index. If half of all revenue from China were eliminated, the S&P 500 EPS would drop by approximately 3.4%.

However, investors are advised to stay vigilant as a slowdown in China could potentially cause future problems. This is particularly relevant for companies with significant weightings in the index, such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). These seven major companies earn more than 10% of their revenue from China. Therefore, while the overall risk to the index is relatively minor, there might be pockets of risk and volatility if there's a significant slowdown in China.

Certain industries like tech, autos, household products, and pharma have a higher-than-average exposure to China which could lead to an unstable profit outlook. Furthermore, some U.S. businesses are at an even greater risk as they derive over 30% of their revenue from China. These include Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: ), Aptiv (NYSE: ), Estée Lauder, Lam Research Corp (NASDAQ: )., Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: ).

Despite recent positive news about Chinese retail sales and industrial production, investors remain cautious. In August alone, foreign investors withdrew nearly $15 billion from Chinese stocks. While U.S. stocks have so far avoided the volatility experienced by offshore Chinese counterparts this year due to hopes of economic recovery, companies with substantial China exposure may continue to be viewed as less attractive by some investors.

JPMorgan (NYSE: ) strategists noted a clear distinction between European rate hikes and an anticipated pause from the Federal Reserve that aligns with earlier decisions made by Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia. They highlighted a common message across central banks guiding towards a 'high for long' pause.

In other news, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) suggested a portfolio of defensive growth is suitable for a ""late cycle"" trading market.

2022-09-19, Investing.com,Instacart achieves $9.9 billion valuation in successful IPO,https://in.investing.com/news/instacart-achieves-99-billion-valuation-in-successful-ipo-93CH-3814498,"Grocery delivery app Instacart, owned by Maplebear Inc, has successfully priced its initial public offering (IPO) at the top of its indicated range, achieving a fully diluted valuation of $9.9 billion. The shares are set to start trading on NASDAQ on Tuesday. The IPO raised $660 million, with the company pricing it at $30 per share following strong investor demand.

This valuation is notably lower than the $39 billion valuation that investors assigned to Instacart during a private fundraising round in March 2021, amidst the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the pandemic-induced surge in demand for grocery delivery services tapering off, Instacart has proven its profitability. The company reported a net income of $242 million for the six months ended June 30, compared to a loss of $74 million in the same period last year.

Investors such as Norges Bank Investment Management and entities affiliated with venture capital firms TCV, Sequoia Capital, D1 Capital Partners and Valiant Capital Management have agreed to buy up to $400 million worth of shares sold in Instacart's IPO. Beverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) also agreed to purchase $175 million in preferred convertible stock.

Despite facing competition from retail giants like Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Target, and Walmart (NYSE: ), Instacart continues to generate revenue by delivering groceries from various chains including Kroger (NYSE: ), Costco (NASDAQ: ), and Wegmans. The company has also expanded its delivery business to non-grocery goods from sellers such as beauty product retailer Sephora, convenience store 7-Eleven and pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE: ).

The company's successful IPO is seen as another sign of the U.S. IPO market's rebound after a dry spell throughout most of this year and 2022. This follows SoftBank (TYO: ) Group Corp's chip designer Arm floating on last week at a $54.5 billion fully diluted valuation, which has since risen to $62 billion after three days of trading.

Last month, Limp confirmed he is stepping down. Under his leadership, Amazon became one of the world’s leading innovators in building devices and underlying services that customers love.

His departure came amid reports that Amazon’s costly bet on smart home devices has not paid off well.

“From Kindle readers to Fire TV to Alexa and Echo, over the past decade and a half we’ve been able to invent and keep improving experiences that help make our customers’ lives better every day,” according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.

Panay is likely to run Amazon’s division for its Alexa and Echo speakers.

He joined Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in 2004 as a group programme manager and became the company’s chief product officer in 2018, where he led the development of Windows 11.

In 2021, Panay was promoted to executive vice president as part of the top leadership team under Microsoft Chairman and CEO, Satya Nadella.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,"Leading U.S. banks set to launch 'Paze', a mobile wallet in response to tech giants",https://in.investing.com/news/leading-us-banks-set-to-launch-paze-a-mobile-wallet-in-response-to-tech-giants-93CH-3813153,"In the latest development in the ongoing competition between traditional banking institutions and tech giants, major American banks are preparing to introduce a mobile wallet, Paze, which will connect directly with the credit and debit card accounts of 150 million customers. The app, scheduled for launch next year, is a collective effort by JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), and others. Early Warning Services, which operates the payment app Zelle, will manage Paze.

This move marks a significant shift in strategy for these banking giants. Previously, they believed they could individually compete against Big Tech and emerging fintech startups. However, the rise of tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the financial services sector has led these banks to reconsider their approach.

Over recent years, JPMorgan Chase has partnered with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple to expand their banking services. In a similar vein, Citi has inked a deal to finance Amazon's installment payment offering. This trend is not just confined to the United States. In Europe, Lloyds Banking Group (LON: ) is exploring partnerships with fintech companies, while Orange's banking division in France has made deals with fintechs Younited and Mambu for digital lending and online banking platforms respectively.

Nevertheless, these collaborations have not been without regulatory scrutiny. Regulators are increasingly concerned about potential risks these partnerships could pose to banks and the wider U.S. banking system.

The mobile wallet market has become a key area of competition between banks and tech companies. Banks have traditionally dominated consumer payments but the rise of Apple Pay has challenged this dominance. While Apple does not disclose official usage statistics for its mobile wallet, it is reported that over 500 million users have adopted Apple Pay in just five years.

In hopes of emulating their success with Zelle - which since its 2017 launch has become the largest peer-to-peer payment app with transactions totaling $629 billion last year - banks are launching Paze. Yet, the handling of fraud cases involving Zelle has drawn criticism towards these banks.

The success of Paze will largely rely on banks' willingness to allow it to connect directly to customers' bank accounts, giving it a potential advantage over Apple Pay. The Paze team recently recruited Cameron Fowler, a top executive from BMO Financial Group, as its next CEO. However, details about Paze's functionality and whether users will be able to access their account information through the app remain limited.

With tech companies continuing to expand their financial services offerings and banks striving to maintain their market share, the future of the financial services industry remains uncertain.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

Goldman Sachs said the company's Q2 outlook ""fell short of lofty expectations.""

""While the print/guide is unlikely to dissuade bulls, we see the current risk/reward skew as balanced in lieu of upside to near-term expects given an already demanding valuation profile,"" Rangan wrote in a note.

For Guggenheim, however, the Oracle bullish thesis remains intact:

""We see little risk in achieving F2Q goals, especially given the $1.5B in bookings in the first week of the quarter. Do these results change our thesis on ORCL? No. We continue to believe that the three legs of growth either still have much to go (SaaS), are at a very early stage (OCI), or are only just beginning (On Prem database migration to the Cloud). We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

2022-09-16, IANS,Amazon hires Spyglass and Universal Studios veteran to heads its MGM acquisition venture,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-hires-spyglass-and-universal-studios-veteran-to-heads-its-mgm-acquisition-venture-3812309,"Los Angeles, Sep 17 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) MGM Studios has grabbed veteran Peter Oillataguerre from Spyglass to make him its Head of Feature Film Production. Oillataguerre is taking on the newly created role of head of feature film production for Amazon MGM Studios, Hollywood Reporter reported.

The highly rated executive, who comes from Spyglass, will report to Dan Scharf, head of global business operations, and is expected to work closely with head of film, streaming and theatrical Courtenay Valenti and the company's film teams as the newly B2B home delivery to films ventures seeks to expand its footprint in the entertainment industry and Hollywood.

""Peter brings with him more than 20 years of industry experience. He is a veteran executive with tremendous expertise in the world of production. In his new Avatar, he will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the feature film production cycle for the Amazon MGM Studios film group,"" Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios, wrote in an email to staff on Friday.

At Spyglass, Oillataguerre worked on films such as 'Scream', 'Hellraiser' and 'The Upside', and also worked on TV series 'Project Runway'. Prior to Spyglass, he worked at Universal Studios and MGM Studios, with projects, including James Bond features 'Skyfall' and 'No Time to Die', as well as 'Creed'.

Amazon gave Ben Affleck’s 'Air' a global theatrical release, considered significant as streamers had been reluctant to grant traditional releases to their properties previously. The studio has multiple titles due out later this year, including 'Totally Killer' streaming on October 6. It is giving Emerald Fennell's festival feature 'Saltburn' a limited release on November 24, Hollywood Reporter said.

Amazon acquired MGM Studios for a record $8.45 billion, making it its bold B2B deal and foray into the entertainment industry, thus turbocharging its streaming ambitions, considered its second biggest deal after it acquired Whole Foods grocery chain in the US. The deal is the second-largest acquisition in Amazon's history, behind its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in 2017.

Amazon hopes to leverage MGM's storied filmmaking history and wide-ranging catalog of 4,000 films and 17,000 TV shows to help bolster Amazon Studios, its film and TV division. Prime Video watchers would now be able to watch a richer fare of movies and TV serials across the globe as Amazon expands its footprint in the show business, as it competes fiercely with HBO, Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney Hulu OTT platforms.

Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, had called the deal then clinched way back in 2021 as: ""It's very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.""

In a statement, MGM Chairman Kevin Ulrich had then said: ""The opportunity to align MGM's storied history with Amazon is an inspiring combination.""

Amazon shares barely moved up on the merger announcement then in the New York Stock Exchange.

2022-09-15, Investing.com,Amazon's AWS and AI advancements fuel decade-long stock growth,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-aws-and-ai-advancements-fuel-decadelong-stock-growth-93CH-3811165,"Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) stock has been closely associated with its operating income, which has surged by a remarkable 2,700% over the past decade, largely due to the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud-computing platform. A decade-long analysis reveals a strong correlation between Amazon's stock price, which has risen approximately 800%, and its operating income.

In the first half of 2022, AWS accounted for nearly 17% of Amazon's total net sales, amounting to $43.5 billion. Even more significantly, AWS generated $10.5 billion in operating income during this period, representing 84% of Amazon's total operating income. The influence of AWS on Amazon's overall financial health is palpable, indicating that without this business unit, the returns on Amazon's stock would likely have been drastically different over the past decade.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning advancements are set to play a significant role in the future growth of AWS. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributes much of AWS's expansion to these technological trends. Despite AI being a relatively new term in investment circles, its potential for growth is substantial. The AI market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of over 37% through 2030, reaching a value of $1.8 trillion according to Grand View Research.

The potential impact of AI on AWS is further highlighted by the financial outlook for 2022. By the end of the second quarter, Amazon had $132.1 billion in remaining performance obligations, primarily related to AWS. These obligations represent the revenue Amazon expects to generate over the next few years from existing cloud-computing agreements.

The remaining performance obligations for AWS in Q2 showed an increase of $12 billion from the previous quarter and $32 billion from the same period in the previous year. This growth trajectory, combined with the projected expansion of the AI market, suggests a promising future for AWS and, by extension, Amazon's operating income and stock price.

In 2017, AWS India became the first global CSP in India to receive full empanelment for its cloud service offerings after the AWS Asia-Pacific (Mumbai) Region completed MeitY’s STQC (Standardization Testing and Quality Certification) audit.

“With both AWS Regions in India empaneled by MeitY, AWS is providing customers more choice to access resilient, secure, and low-latency cloud infrastructure, while offering more ability for AWS Partners to develop innovative solutions and address customer needs,” said Shalini Kapoor, director and chief technologist for the public sector with AWS India.

The empanelment affirms that AWS meets government standards of quality, availability, and security, and provides government organisations, public sector undertakings (PSUs), statutory bodies, and financial institutions mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) more scope to innovate with the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Government organisations can improve e-governance standards and enable on-demand digital services for citizens and businesses across the country, said the company.

Similarly, financial services organisations can benefit from agile, efficient, and security-compliant cloud solutions at scale, providing consumers faster and secure digital banking, insurance, and payment innovations.

AWS’s planned investment in cloud infrastructure in India by 2030 includes allocating more resources to data center infrastructure, which will create an estimated average of 131,700 full-time equivalent jobs across industries like construction, facility maintenance, and engineering roles, among others. AWS’s investments in cloud infrastructure is expected to contribute $23.3 billion to India’s total GDP by 2030.

2022-09-15, IANS,Amazon introduces 5 new ways for easy smartphone-based search & shop,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-introduces-5-new-ways-for-easy-smartphonebased-search--shop-3810721,"New Delhi, Sep 15 (IANS) E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has introduced 5 new ways to make it easier to search and shop for products on smartphones.New Delhi, Sep 15 (IANS) E-commerce giant Amazon has introduced 5 new ways to make it easier to search and shop for products on smartphones.

Now, to help customers find what they want when they don’t know what they are looking for, Amazon is offering the ability to tap the camera icon in the search bar and snap a picture.

“Our visual search algorithms will find the best possible matches across our vast selection,” said the company.

The company recently added a new feature to its visual search tool that enables users to add text to their visual search queries.

To make a purchase for home items, Amazon recently extended ‘View in Your Room’ feature -- which enables to see exactly how a piece of furniture or decor will look in the space -- to include tabletop items, such as lamps, home décor, and small appliances like toaster ovens and coffee makers.

“The new mobile experience uses augmented reality to place the products you’re searching for on a tabletop surface in your home,” said Amazon.

You can move the products from one surface to another to better evaluate how these products fit in the environment.

Amazon recently started showing sales trend data in search results and on product detail pages.

“Now, if you spot a product you like anywhere online, tap the ‘Share’ button, choose the Amazon Shopping app, and click ‘Find products on Amazon.’ You’ll be taken straight to the Amazon Shopping app, where you’ll see similar products,” the e-commerce giant added.

Since many shoppers search for previously purchased items, Amazon has now made it easier to find them.

“Once we recognise that you are searching for a previously purchased item, we’ll present the item at the top of search results with the date of the last purchase,” said the company.

In cases where it is a frequently reordered item, “we will also show a thumbnail image of the item in the search bar”.

The decision comes as part of the tech giant's ongoing strategy to slow hiring.

While a small number of employees will be affected by the layoffs, the majority of the team will remain in place to support crucial hiring needs. Alphabet has also committed to assisting affected employees in finding new roles both within and outside the organization.

Earlier this year, Alphabet, along with other tech giants such as Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), underwent significant downsizing in response to a slowing economy that brought an abrupt end to their pandemic-driven hiring sprees.

In January 2022, Alphabet reduced its workforce by approximately 6%, equating to around 12,000 positions. This move followed a period of rapid growth for the company, which added over 50,000 employees starting in 2021 due to surging demand for its services during the pandemic. However, fears of an economic downturn led advertisers to cut back their spending last year, slowing the growth of Alphabet's core digital ad business.

According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alphabet had 190,234 employees at the end of 2022. By the end of June 2022, this number had dropped to 181,798.

Alphabet's President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat stated in July that the company is focused on reorganizing expenses to make room for investments that yield the highest returns.

The layoffs have sparked reactions from affected employees on LinkedIn, many of whom expressed disappointment at their dream jobs coming to an end. However, they also acknowledged the need for Alphabet Inc. to mitigate losses and keep the business running effectively amidst economic challenges.

2022-09-13, IANS,Musk got upset with Bezos when not invited to Blue Origin's factory: Book,https://in.investing.com/news/musk-got-upset-with-bezos-when-not-invited-to-blue-origins-factory-book-3808010,"New Delhi, Sep 13 (IANS) Tesla (NASDAQ: ) & SpaceX CEO Elon Musk got upset when Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos did not invite him to visit Blue Origin's factory, Musk’s biography by American author-journalist Walter Isaacson has revealed.The new biography, titled ""Elon Musk"", highlights the early stages of his relationship with Bezos when he invited the Amazon founder to tour SpaceX in 2004, reports Insider.

Following the tour, Musk sent Bezos a ""curt"" email expressing his disappointment at not being invited to see Blue Origin's factory in return, according to Isaacson.

A surprised Bezos then responded to the email with an invitation.

According to the biography, after touring Blue Origin, the couple had dinner with their then wives, MacKenzie Scott and Justine Musk. Apparently, the dinner did not go over well due to Musk's seemingly unwanted advice to Bezos, as reported in this book and in Christian Davenport's book, ""The Space Barons"".

However, it's unclear what the advice was, the report mentioned.

Since that dinner, the two have traded digs publicly, sparred over their space ambitions, and traded places as the world's richest people.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Jeff Bezos is the world's third-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $165 billion, owing largely to his stake in e-commerce giant Amazon. Musk currently holds the top spot on the list, with a net worth of $242 billion.

Meanwhile, the biography also revealed that Musk and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates got into a verbal spat after the Tesla CEO confronted the Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder over shorting the electric-car company's shares last year. Isaacson wrote that in early 2022, Gates spoke to Musk and said he wanted to ""come see (him) and talk about philanthropy and climate"" at a meeting.

The meeting happened at Musk's Texas plant where the SpaceX owner confronted Gates over the decision to short Tesla stock.

Musk said in April 2022 that Gates had taken a half-billion dollar short position against Tesla. Gates apologised for the move but Musk was still upset and became ""super mean"" to the Microsoft founder.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Oracle faces slowing cloud sales growth despite AI optimism,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-faces-slowing-cloud-sales-growth-despite-ai-optimism-93CH-3806654,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ) faced a sharp decline in its stock price, falling as much as 13% on Tuesday, following lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and a below-estimate forecast for the second quarter. The company's earnings report, released on Monday, fell short of Wall Street's expectations, signaling that the anticipated boost from generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) might take longer to materialize than initially expected.

The company is known for its database software and has been trying to catch up with major cloud providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google Cloud. However, Oracle's cloud sales growth slowed down in Q1, with the company's cloud infrastructure revenue coming in at $1.5 billion, marking a 66% increase but still lower than the previous quarter's 76% growth.

Oracle's CEO Safra Catz also warned of near-term weakness in revenue growth at the Cerner (NASDAQ: ) health records business, which Oracle acquired for $28.3 billion last year. The company is transitioning customers in this unit to the cloud from license purchases that are recognized upfront.

Despite these challenges, Oracle continues to see growth in its infrastructure-as-a-service business, which grew by 66% year-over-year. Oracle's chief technology officer, executive chairman, and co-founder Larry Ellison noted during the company's earnings call that AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation2 Cloud.

However, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria expressed concerns about Oracle's growth prospects stating, “We continue to believe high single-digit growth might be unsustainable for Oracle given Cerner integration risks and formidable data center competition,” as he cut his price target on the stock to $105.

Despite these concerns, most analysts remain positive about Oracle. At least 14 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $133, nearly 5% higher than the company’s last closing price. Barclays (LON: ) analysts attributed the share price decline to Oracle’s rally in the run-up to earnings and highlighted strong deferred revenue, AI backlog commentary and some positive signs in the cloud business as positives.

Oracle currently has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.78, compared with the industry median of 15.42. The company's stock has risen 55% this year on optimism that the rise of generative AI would drive up cloud demand.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Amazon Announces Supply Chain by Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-announces-supply-chain-by-amazon-432SI-3806186,"This week at Accelerate, Amazon’s (AMZN) annual seller conference, the company announced Supply Chain by Amazon, an end-to-end, fully automated set of supply chain services that will provide sellers with a complete solution to quickly and reliably move products directly from their manufacturers to customers around the world. Supply Chain by Amazon enables sellers to benefit from Amazon’s advanced logistics, fulfillment, and transportation capabilities to keep products in stock, ship faster and more reliably, and significantly lower costs.

With Supply Chain by Amazon, Amazon will pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels, and deliver directly to customers. Sellers can now focus on building great products for their customers and growing their business, while Amazon handles the logistics, reduces costs, and improves delivery speed. Key benefits of Supply Chain by Amazon include:

Automatic cross-border discounts for Amazon Global Logistics (AGL) : Amazon’s new prices now reflect discounts up to 25% on all cross-border transportation that is bound for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD), further reducing costs for selling partners using Supply Chain by Amazon. AWD is Amazon’s low-cost storage service that provides sellers the ability to store their inventory in Amazon distribution centers and seamlessly distribute products in bulk.

Streamlined domestic inbound transportation to AWD with Partnered Carrier Program (PCP) : In addition to AGL for cross-border transportation, later this year sellers can use PCP to streamline domestic transportation into AWD centers.

A new Multi-Channel Distribution (MCD) capability : MCD moves sellers’ products in bulk from AWD to any sales channel (including online stores and physical store locations), allowing selling partners to replenish across all their sales and fulfillment channels, not just on Amazon, from a single inventory pool. MCD is currently in pilot with an initial set of sellers and is expected to be available to all sellers later this year.

MCD is currently in pilot with an initial set of sellers and is expected to be available to all sellers later this year. Automatic inventory replenishment with FBA: In addition to the cost savings through AWD, Amazon will now use its advanced machine learning and supply chain optimization capabilities to automatically replenish inventory into the optimal Amazon fulfillment centers to support expected customer demand, allowing sellers to benefit from even faster speeds from FBA and deliver customer orders for off-Amazon channels through Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF). Placing sellers’ products in the right quantities and the right locations to meet customer demand increases the potential for same-day and next-day delivery speeds, which in turn drives an average 15% increase in unit sales.

“Our vision has always been to make it as easy as possible for sellers to serve customers around the world, and providing our selling partners with a simple, fast, cost-effective solution to a challenge that has become increasingly unpredictable and complex is an important investment in sellers’ success,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon vice president of WW Selling Partner Services. “With Supply Chain by Amazon, Amazon will pick up sellers’ inventory directly from their factory, and manage the supply chain logistics through delivery to customers’ doorsteps. Sellers will be able to offload even more of the complexity of their supply chain logistics to Amazon, both for the products they sell in Amazon’s store and through other sales channels including online and physical store locations. We are excited to help sellers, both on and off Amazon, save more money, drive more business growth, and have more time to continue inventing amazing products for customers.”

Today, selling partners can simplify supply chain management, unlock faster delivery, and get significantly lower costs with Supply Chain by Amazon. The benefits and flexibility will become even greater later this year with the expansion of MCD and AWD storage reservations.

2022-09-15, Investing.com,Amazon's AWS and AI advancements fuel decade-long stock growth,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-aws-and-ai-advancements-fuel-decadelong-stock-growth-93CH-3811165,"Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) stock has been closely associated with its operating income, which has surged by a remarkable 2,700% over the past decade, largely due to the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud-computing platform. A decade-long analysis reveals a strong correlation between Amazon's stock price, which has risen approximately 800%, and its operating income.

In the first half of 2022, AWS accounted for nearly 17% of Amazon's total net sales, amounting to $43.5 billion. Even more significantly, AWS generated $10.5 billion in operating income during this period, representing 84% of Amazon's total operating income. The influence of AWS on Amazon's overall financial health is palpable, indicating that without this business unit, the returns on Amazon's stock would likely have been drastically different over the past decade.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning advancements are set to play a significant role in the future growth of AWS. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attributes much of AWS's expansion to these technological trends. Despite AI being a relatively new term in investment circles, its potential for growth is substantial. The AI market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of over 37% through 2030, reaching a value of $1.8 trillion according to Grand View Research.

The potential impact of AI on AWS is further highlighted by the financial outlook for 2022. By the end of the second quarter, Amazon had $132.1 billion in remaining performance obligations, primarily related to AWS. These obligations represent the revenue Amazon expects to generate over the next few years from existing cloud-computing agreements.

The remaining performance obligations for AWS in Q2 showed an increase of $12 billion from the previous quarter and $32 billion from the same period in the previous year. This growth trajectory, combined with the projected expansion of the AI market, suggests a promising future for AWS and, by extension, Amazon's operating income and stock price.

In 2017, AWS India became the first global CSP in India to receive full empanelment for its cloud service offerings after the AWS Asia-Pacific (Mumbai) Region completed MeitY’s STQC (Standardization Testing and Quality Certification) audit.

“With both AWS Regions in India empaneled by MeitY, AWS is providing customers more choice to access resilient, secure, and low-latency cloud infrastructure, while offering more ability for AWS Partners to develop innovative solutions and address customer needs,” said Shalini Kapoor, director and chief technologist for the public sector with AWS India.

The empanelment affirms that AWS meets government standards of quality, availability, and security, and provides government organisations, public sector undertakings (PSUs), statutory bodies, and financial institutions mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) more scope to innovate with the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

Government organisations can improve e-governance standards and enable on-demand digital services for citizens and businesses across the country, said the company.

Similarly, financial services organisations can benefit from agile, efficient, and security-compliant cloud solutions at scale, providing consumers faster and secure digital banking, insurance, and payment innovations.

AWS’s planned investment in cloud infrastructure in India by 2030 includes allocating more resources to data center infrastructure, which will create an estimated average of 131,700 full-time equivalent jobs across industries like construction, facility maintenance, and engineering roles, among others. AWS’s investments in cloud infrastructure is expected to contribute $23.3 billion to India’s total GDP by 2030.

2022-09-15, IANS,Amazon introduces 5 new ways for easy smartphone-based search & shop,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-introduces-5-new-ways-for-easy-smartphonebased-search--shop-3810721,"New Delhi, Sep 15 (IANS) E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has introduced 5 new ways to make it easier to search and shop for products on smartphones.New Delhi, Sep 15 (IANS) E-commerce giant Amazon has introduced 5 new ways to make it easier to search and shop for products on smartphones.

Now, to help customers find what they want when they don’t know what they are looking for, Amazon is offering the ability to tap the camera icon in the search bar and snap a picture.

“Our visual search algorithms will find the best possible matches across our vast selection,” said the company.

The company recently added a new feature to its visual search tool that enables users to add text to their visual search queries.

To make a purchase for home items, Amazon recently extended ‘View in Your Room’ feature -- which enables to see exactly how a piece of furniture or decor will look in the space -- to include tabletop items, such as lamps, home décor, and small appliances like toaster ovens and coffee makers.

“The new mobile experience uses augmented reality to place the products you’re searching for on a tabletop surface in your home,” said Amazon.

You can move the products from one surface to another to better evaluate how these products fit in the environment.

Amazon recently started showing sales trend data in search results and on product detail pages.

“Now, if you spot a product you like anywhere online, tap the ‘Share’ button, choose the Amazon Shopping app, and click ‘Find products on Amazon.’ You’ll be taken straight to the Amazon Shopping app, where you’ll see similar products,” the e-commerce giant added.

Since many shoppers search for previously purchased items, Amazon has now made it easier to find them.

“Once we recognise that you are searching for a previously purchased item, we’ll present the item at the top of search results with the date of the last purchase,” said the company.

In cases where it is a frequently reordered item, “we will also show a thumbnail image of the item in the search bar”.

The decision comes as part of the tech giant's ongoing strategy to slow hiring.

While a small number of employees will be affected by the layoffs, the majority of the team will remain in place to support crucial hiring needs. Alphabet has also committed to assisting affected employees in finding new roles both within and outside the organization.

Earlier this year, Alphabet, along with other tech giants such as Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), underwent significant downsizing in response to a slowing economy that brought an abrupt end to their pandemic-driven hiring sprees.

In January 2022, Alphabet reduced its workforce by approximately 6%, equating to around 12,000 positions. This move followed a period of rapid growth for the company, which added over 50,000 employees starting in 2021 due to surging demand for its services during the pandemic. However, fears of an economic downturn led advertisers to cut back their spending last year, slowing the growth of Alphabet's core digital ad business.

According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alphabet had 190,234 employees at the end of 2022. By the end of June 2022, this number had dropped to 181,798.

Alphabet's President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat stated in July that the company is focused on reorganizing expenses to make room for investments that yield the highest returns.

The layoffs have sparked reactions from affected employees on LinkedIn, many of whom expressed disappointment at their dream jobs coming to an end. However, they also acknowledged the need for Alphabet Inc. to mitigate losses and keep the business running effectively amidst economic challenges.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 0.5% the day after the tech giant revealed four new iPhone models at its annual hardware refresher, but refrained from launching major updates to the flagship device's design or software.

Ford (NYSE: ) stock rose 2.3% after the auto giant announced plans to double production of hybrid F-150 pickup trucks in 2024, accelerating the pivot toward gas-electric powertrains as a hedge against reluctance among U.S. truck buyers to go all-electric.

BP (LON: ) (NYSE: ) ADRs dipped 0.3% after CEO Bernard Looney resigned after less than four years in the oil major's top job for failing to fully disclose details of past personal relationships with colleagues, casting doubt on the company’s future policies.

Spirit Airlines (NYSE: ) stock fell 2.6% after the low-cost carrier lowered its third-quarter revenue outlook to account for increased fuel prices.

Moderna (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 3.1% after the drug maker announced it was scaling down manufacturing of its COVID-19 vaccine, an updated version of which was approved this week by U.S. regulators, to help it sooner hit its target of 75% to 80% gross margin growth.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 1.7% after India’s commerce minister said the EV manufacturer plans to source components worth $1.7-$1.9 billion from India this year, amid plans to set up a factory in the country.

Oracle (NYSE: ) stock rose 2.9% after JPMorgan (NYSE: ) downgraded its stance on the computer software company to ‘neutral’ from ‘overweight’, citing its soft second-quarter revenue guidance.

Nio (NYSE: ) ADRs fell 3.5%, Li Auto (NASDAQ: ) fell 0.1% and Xpeng (NYSE: ) dropped 1.8% after the European Commission announced an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese electric vehicles.

2022-09-13, IANS,Musk got upset with Bezos when not invited to Blue Origin's factory: Book,https://in.investing.com/news/musk-got-upset-with-bezos-when-not-invited-to-blue-origins-factory-book-3808010,"New Delhi, Sep 13 (IANS) Tesla (NASDAQ: ) & SpaceX CEO Elon Musk got upset when Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos did not invite him to visit Blue Origin's factory, Musk’s biography by American author-journalist Walter Isaacson has revealed.The new biography, titled ""Elon Musk"", highlights the early stages of his relationship with Bezos when he invited the Amazon founder to tour SpaceX in 2004, reports Insider.

Following the tour, Musk sent Bezos a ""curt"" email expressing his disappointment at not being invited to see Blue Origin's factory in return, according to Isaacson.

A surprised Bezos then responded to the email with an invitation.

According to the biography, after touring Blue Origin, the couple had dinner with their then wives, MacKenzie Scott and Justine Musk. Apparently, the dinner did not go over well due to Musk's seemingly unwanted advice to Bezos, as reported in this book and in Christian Davenport's book, ""The Space Barons"".

However, it's unclear what the advice was, the report mentioned.

Since that dinner, the two have traded digs publicly, sparred over their space ambitions, and traded places as the world's richest people.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Jeff Bezos is the world's third-wealthiest person, with a net worth of $165 billion, owing largely to his stake in e-commerce giant Amazon. Musk currently holds the top spot on the list, with a net worth of $242 billion.

Meanwhile, the biography also revealed that Musk and billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates got into a verbal spat after the Tesla CEO confronted the Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder over shorting the electric-car company's shares last year. Isaacson wrote that in early 2022, Gates spoke to Musk and said he wanted to ""come see (him) and talk about philanthropy and climate"" at a meeting.

The meeting happened at Musk's Texas plant where the SpaceX owner confronted Gates over the decision to short Tesla stock.

Musk said in April 2022 that Gates had taken a half-billion dollar short position against Tesla. Gates apologised for the move but Musk was still upset and became ""super mean"" to the Microsoft founder.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Oracle faces slowing cloud sales growth despite AI optimism,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-faces-slowing-cloud-sales-growth-despite-ai-optimism-93CH-3806654,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ) faced a sharp decline in its stock price, falling as much as 13% on Tuesday, following lower-than-expected revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and a below-estimate forecast for the second quarter. The company's earnings report, released on Monday, fell short of Wall Street's expectations, signaling that the anticipated boost from generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) might take longer to materialize than initially expected.

The company is known for its database software and has been trying to catch up with major cloud providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google Cloud. However, Oracle's cloud sales growth slowed down in Q1, with the company's cloud infrastructure revenue coming in at $1.5 billion, marking a 66% increase but still lower than the previous quarter's 76% growth.

Oracle's CEO Safra Catz also warned of near-term weakness in revenue growth at the Cerner (NASDAQ: ) health records business, which Oracle acquired for $28.3 billion last year. The company is transitioning customers in this unit to the cloud from license purchases that are recognized upfront.

Despite these challenges, Oracle continues to see growth in its infrastructure-as-a-service business, which grew by 66% year-over-year. Oracle's chief technology officer, executive chairman, and co-founder Larry Ellison noted during the company's earnings call that AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation2 Cloud.

However, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria expressed concerns about Oracle's growth prospects stating, “We continue to believe high single-digit growth might be unsustainable for Oracle given Cerner integration risks and formidable data center competition,” as he cut his price target on the stock to $105.

Despite these concerns, most analysts remain positive about Oracle. At least 14 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $133, nearly 5% higher than the company’s last closing price. Barclays (LON: ) analysts attributed the share price decline to Oracle’s rally in the run-up to earnings and highlighted strong deferred revenue, AI backlog commentary and some positive signs in the cloud business as positives.

Oracle currently has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.78, compared with the industry median of 15.42. The company's stock has risen 55% this year on optimism that the rise of generative AI would drive up cloud demand.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Amazon Announces Supply Chain by Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-announces-supply-chain-by-amazon-432SI-3806186,"This week at Accelerate, Amazon’s (AMZN) annual seller conference, the company announced Supply Chain by Amazon, an end-to-end, fully automated set of supply chain services that will provide sellers with a complete solution to quickly and reliably move products directly from their manufacturers to customers around the world. Supply Chain by Amazon enables sellers to benefit from Amazon’s advanced logistics, fulfillment, and transportation capabilities to keep products in stock, ship faster and more reliably, and significantly lower costs.

With Supply Chain by Amazon, Amazon will pick up inventory from manufacturing facilities around the world, ship it across borders, handle customs clearance and ground transportation, store inventory in bulk, manage replenishment across Amazon and other sales channels, and deliver directly to customers. Sellers can now focus on building great products for their customers and growing their business, while Amazon handles the logistics, reduces costs, and improves delivery speed. Key benefits of Supply Chain by Amazon include:

Automatic cross-border discounts for Amazon Global Logistics (AGL) : Amazon’s new prices now reflect discounts up to 25% on all cross-border transportation that is bound for Amazon Warehousing and Distribution (AWD), further reducing costs for selling partners using Supply Chain by Amazon. AWD is Amazon’s low-cost storage service that provides sellers the ability to store their inventory in Amazon distribution centers and seamlessly distribute products in bulk.

Streamlined domestic inbound transportation to AWD with Partnered Carrier Program (PCP) : In addition to AGL for cross-border transportation, later this year sellers can use PCP to streamline domestic transportation into AWD centers.

With no peak pricing during Q4, sellers can more efficiently manage inventory levels, even during the holiday season. Coming soon, sellers will also be able to reserve low-cost, long-term bulk storage months in advance at even deeper discounts.

A new Multi-Channel Distribution (MCD) capability : MCD moves sellers’ products in bulk from AWD to any sales channel (including online stores and physical store locations), allowing selling partners to replenish across all their sales and fulfillment channels, not just on Amazon, from a single inventory pool. MCD is currently in pilot with an initial set of sellers and is expected to be available to all sellers later this year.

MCD is currently in pilot with an initial set of sellers and is expected to be available to all sellers later this year. Automatic inventory replenishment with FBA: In addition to the cost savings through AWD, Amazon will now use its advanced machine learning and supply chain optimization capabilities to automatically replenish inventory into the optimal Amazon fulfillment centers to support expected customer demand, allowing sellers to benefit from even faster speeds from FBA and deliver customer orders for off-Amazon channels through Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF). Placing sellers’ products in the right quantities and the right locations to meet customer demand increases the potential for same-day and next-day delivery speeds, which in turn drives an average 15% increase in unit sales.

“Our vision has always been to make it as easy as possible for sellers to serve customers around the world, and providing our selling partners with a simple, fast, cost-effective solution to a challenge that has become increasingly unpredictable and complex is an important investment in sellers’ success,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon vice president of WW Selling Partner Services. “With Supply Chain by Amazon, Amazon will pick up sellers’ inventory directly from their factory, and manage the supply chain logistics through delivery to customers’ doorsteps. Sellers will be able to offload even more of the complexity of their supply chain logistics to Amazon, both for the products they sell in Amazon’s store and through other sales channels including online and physical store locations. We are excited to help sellers, both on and off Amazon, save more money, drive more business growth, and have more time to continue inventing amazing products for customers.”

Today, selling partners can simplify supply chain management, unlock faster delivery, and get significantly lower costs with Supply Chain by Amazon. The benefits and flexibility will become even greater later this year with the expansion of MCD and AWD storage reservations.

By the end of August, about 80 employees -- around 45 per cent of Grindr’s 180-person workforce -- had resigned from the company due to the mandate.

According to the labour group Communications Workers of America (CWA), Grindr informed its staff last month that they had two weeks to decide whether they would relocate to an office location and work on-site two days per week or terminate their employment.

Grindr provided a severance package to employees who were unable or unwilling to comply with the relocation requirement, which the union group described as an attempt ""to silence workers from speaking out about their working conditions"", the report mentioned.

""These decisions have left Grindr dangerously understaffed and raises questions about the safety, security and stability of the app for users,"" Erick Cortez, a member of Grindr United-CWA, was quoted as saying.

""It is clear Grindr wants workers to be silenced and deterred from exercising our right to organise, regardless of the expense,"" he added.

Grindr employees had announced their intention to unionise through CWA on July 20, but the labour drive has yet to be formalised.

On August 4, the company announced its mandate for employees to return to work, the report said.

Moreover, the CWA has filed a formal complaint regarding the company's actions with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of Grindr employees.

A Grindr spokesperson said the claims have ""no merit"".

""We have full confidence in our team and their ability to continue to drive the business forward and make the world and lives of our users freer, more tolerant, and more just,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

""We are looking forward to returning to the office in a hybrid model in October and further improving productivity and collaboration for our entire team,"" it added.

Meanwhile, several Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers have reportedly chosen to quit rather than relocate to various main work hubs.

According to a report from Insider, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy told employees who don’t want to return to the office that “it’s not going to work out for you”.

""It’s past the time to disagree and commit. If you can’t disagree and commit, it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon because we are going back to the office at least three days a week,"" he was quoted as saying.

2022-09-08, Investing.com,Bitcoin inclusion in balance sheets set to boost institutional adoption,https://in.investing.com/news/bitcoin-inclusion-in-balance-sheets-set-to-boost-institutional-adoption-93CH-3801457,"On Friday, experienced a minor rally, trading above the resistance level of US$26,000, after a week-long fluctuation between US$25,500 and US$26,000. This comes amid reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system. The bank is reportedly developing a digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements, pending approval from U.S. regulators.

Meanwhile on Thursday, a new accounting rule was announced that could see tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) reporting on Bitcoin and other altcoins in their balance sheets. The rule mandates companies to declare their crypto holdings at fair value. This development is expected to attract more institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. Companies can adopt this new standard as early as next year, although it will officially be effective after December 15, 2024.

Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at Cryptio, hailed this decision as a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He further explained that this proposal could assist large corporations that have been hesitant to hold crypto on their balance sheet due to technical complexities.

The new requirement demands that companies make a distinct entry for crypto assets in their balance sheet and ensure annual disclosure of changes in their crypto assets opening and closing balances. However, there are some exemptions such as the immediate conversion of Bitcoin to cash.

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's CEO, welcomed this change stating ""Fair value accounting is coming to Bitcoin. This upgrade to FASB accounting rules eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset.""

This move might also lead to heavyweight companies like Apple including crypto assets in their balance sheet. In 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed owning Bitcoin or when asked about it.

The market is also anticipating a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding BlackRock (NYSE: )'s application to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), submitted on June 15.

“Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,” they wrote in a report to clients.

Companies that integrate generative AI into their business practices can benefit from faster product and content introductions, leading to higher revenues and 20-30% lower costs, according to the analysts.

“In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, tech-enhanced competitors will put companies out of business that aren't equally tech-first, in our view. Using generative AI to drive higher ROICs in media and internet will become table stakes within 3-5 years, we estimate. Use it or lose it (via bankruptcy) is our key investment conclusion,” they added.

While the analysts say it’s hard to pick winners and losers now, they believe that clear winners could prove to be “the arms dealers that house large language models (LLMs).”

“Today, the 3 LLM front-runners are , and . We believe these 3 companies will grow their market caps to be larger than AAPL's $3T.”

The analysts argue that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is “not a core beneficiary of the trend toward generative AI because it is not an arms dealer.”

The annual subscriptions will not renew at the end of their terms.

“Please contact the publisher directly to cancel your Print Newsstand subscription,” the company said.

“People will want to know why, of course, and the answer is the expected one: Unfortunately Fantasy never reached a point of paying for itself, and with the Kindle Periodicals mess it’s just not sustainable,” it added.

Last March, Amazon announced it will stop all of its print and Kindle magazine and newspaper subscriptions from next year.

“Since that announcement, independent publishers have been scrambling to figure out how to make up for the loss in income that would ensue when many of their subscribers would suddenly disappear,” reports The Verge.

Weighing on global sentiment this week has been a sharp rise in oil prices after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia unexpectedly extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Although crude has slipped back Wednesday, with the contract down 0.2% at $86.47 a barrel and the contract down 0.4% to $89.64, investors are concerned that the jump in oil prices to their highest level this year with have an impact on inflation and thus how the Federal Reserve will move interest rates going forward.

Through its partnership with brands of all sizes, Amazon’s CCU constantly uncovers new approaches counterfeiters take to try to deceive customers and evade the law. The CCU uses that intelligence to equip law enforcement to pursue bad actors. In 2022, the CCU sued or referred for investigation over 1,300 criminals in the U.S., UK, EU, and China.

In this case, both Russell and Hawat attempted to use a “hidden links” scheme in which they posted links on their social media pages that directed their followers to seemingly generic product listing pages in the Amazon store. Russell and Hawat’s co-conspirators disguised the infringing nature of the products they were selling in order to avoid detection by Amazon and the brand, often by blurring the brand’s logo. Russell and Hawat’s social media posts then made it clear to their followers that if they purchased these seemingly non-infringing and non-branded products, they would actually receive counterfeit luxury products. These bad actors also urged their followers to buy these products before Amazon could take down the listings.

In social media posts from Hawat, she explicitly acknowledges Amazon’s efforts to remove the infringing products and demonstrates her awareness of the illicit nature of the hidden links scheme. In the post she writes in reference to a luxury beach bag, “[Amazon] will be taking down so quickly!! Ordering this now!!” In a similar post where Hawat lists multiple counterfeit items she was promoting, she notes “& that’s really it for Amazon! Links get taken down so fast! So far that’s all that’s back up!”

When Russell or Hawat’s followers used the posted links to purchase the counterfeit products, Russell and Hawat received a commission for that sale. Russell and Hawat not only attempted to profit off of the sale of fake goods that could damage the reputations of the multiple luxury brands they counterfeited, but their actions also negatively impact the thousands of legitimate content creators who have cultivated strong communities built upon trust.

Amazon strongly supports legitimate content creators who strive to help their followers discover new products and experiences, and the company will continue to pursue the small number of bad actors who would attempt to illicitly gain influence and profit by knowingly evading Amazon’s controls and promoting counterfeit products.

“These bad actors knew exactly what they were doing when they attempted to evade Amazon’s brand protection systems to sell counterfeit products that clearly infringed on brands’ intellectual property rights,” said Kebharu Smith, director of Amazon’s CCU. “Content creators serve an important role for consumers around the globe, and these lawsuits not only seek to protect Amazon and the affected brands, but also seek to hold accountable those who diminish the role of legitimate content creators.”

These lawsuits follow similar actions taken by the CCU, including a lawsuit against other bad actors who attempted to implement a hidden links scheme through social media channels. The lawsuit resulted in a 2021 settlement, and Amazon donated settlement payments to the International Trademark Association’s Unreal Campaign that educates 14 to 23 year olds on the importance of intellectual property rights. Amazon’s CCU also filed a joint lawsuit in June 2022 with luxury brand Cartier against an individual and eight associated businesses for a similar hidden links scheme.

The lawsuits were filed in the federal U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington under case numbers:

2022-09-06, Investing.com,EU labels six major tech groups as ,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-labels-six-major-tech-groups-as-gatekeepers-under-new-competition-rules-3798803,"Investing.com -- The European Union has listed six tech giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ), as so-called ""gatekeepers"" that must adhere to the bloc's strict digital regulations.

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

Google responded to the announcement in a blog post, saying it will continue to work closely with EU Commission and ""other stakeholders"" as it ""review[s] our designation decision and assess[es] its implications."""
2022-09-06, IANS,EU designates 6 Big Tech gatekeepers under DMA with provisions for hefty fines,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-designates-6-big-tech-gatekeepers-under-dma-with-provisions-for-hefty-fines-3798651,"London, Sep 6 (IANS) The European Commission on Wednesday designated, for the first time, six gatekeepers -- Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ: )'s parent company), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) -- under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with provisions for hefty penalties for non-compliance.In total, 22 core platform services provided by gatekeepers have been designated in the EU.

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

Rising oil prices weigh on sentiment

Weighing on global sentiment this week has been a sharp rise in oil prices after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia unexpectedly extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Although crude has slipped back Wednesday, with the WTI contract 0.3% lower at $86.42 a barrel and the contract down 0.5% to $89.61, investors are concerned that the jump in oil prices to their highest level this year with have an impact on inflation and thus how the Federal Reserve will move interest rates going forward.

Economic news from Europe and China has been disappointing this week, and that tone continued Wednesday with retail sales in the eurozone falling and German factory orders slumping in July.

Big tech in spotlight after EC ‘gatekeeper’ label

In corporate news, the tech sector will be in focus after the European Commission designated Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), along with China’s ByteDance, as “gatekeepers” under its new Digital Markets Act.

The recent meeting between the e-commerce giant's lawyers and agency officials failed to resolve the impasse. During the talks that took place last month, Amazon's legal team reportedly did not offer to make any concessions.

The FTC is now planning to file its lawsuit against Amazon later this month after conducting an investigation into various aspects of the company’s business practices, including concerns about whether the company gives preferential treatment to its own products on its platforms and how it treats external sellers on Amazon.com.

The incoming lawsuit is expected to target several of Amazon's business practices, including its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics program and the pricing strategies employed by third-party sellers on Amazon.com.

BofA analysts believe that a settlement is “unlikely”, however, they didn’t rule it out from happening.

“While we acknowledge the importance of Amazon’s 3P commission and advertising businesses (which potentially supplies 100%+ of Amazon’s retail profitability) and the potential headline risk due to a drawn out legal process, we think Street will see a tough road ahead for the FTC,” they wrote in a report commenting on the WSJ article.

“E-commerce giant’s lawyers offered no concessions in talks with agency officials last month,” the report mentioned.

The meeting was “a chance for the technology giant to make its case to the regulator to head off a possible lawsuit that officials have been working on for many months”.

The commission has been examining Amazon practices, including whether it favours its own products over competitors’ on its platforms and how it treats outside sellers on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

“The lawsuit will target a number of Amazon’s business practices, such as its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics programme and pricing on Amazon.com by third-party sellers,” the report said, citing people aware of the matter.

According to an earlier report in Politico, the lawsuit might lead to a court-ordered “restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire”.

“The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services,” said the report that came out in July.

On Amazon Prime, the FTC is concerned that the “bundle of services is used to illegally cement the company’s market power”.

The FTC in June sued the e-commerce giant Amazon over alleged 'deceptive' tactics to sign up customers for its Prime service.

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

An Amazon spokesperson had said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

By the end of August, about 80 employees -- around 45 per cent of Grindr’s 180-person workforce -- had resigned from the company due to the mandate.

According to the labour group Communications Workers of America (CWA), Grindr informed its staff last month that they had two weeks to decide whether they would relocate to an office location and work on-site two days per week or terminate their employment.

Grindr provided a severance package to employees who were unable or unwilling to comply with the relocation requirement, which the union group described as an attempt ""to silence workers from speaking out about their working conditions"", the report mentioned.

""These decisions have left Grindr dangerously understaffed and raises questions about the safety, security and stability of the app for users,"" Erick Cortez, a member of Grindr United-CWA, was quoted as saying.

""It is clear Grindr wants workers to be silenced and deterred from exercising our right to organise, regardless of the expense,"" he added.

Grindr employees had announced their intention to unionise through CWA on July 20, but the labour drive has yet to be formalised.

On August 4, the company announced its mandate for employees to return to work, the report said.

Moreover, the CWA has filed a formal complaint regarding the company's actions with the National Labor Relations Board on behalf of Grindr employees.

A Grindr spokesperson said the claims have ""no merit"".

""We have full confidence in our team and their ability to continue to drive the business forward and make the world and lives of our users freer, more tolerant, and more just,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

""We are looking forward to returning to the office in a hybrid model in October and further improving productivity and collaboration for our entire team,"" it added.

Meanwhile, several Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers have reportedly chosen to quit rather than relocate to various main work hubs.

According to a report from Insider, Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy told employees who don’t want to return to the office that “it’s not going to work out for you”.

""It’s past the time to disagree and commit. If you can’t disagree and commit, it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon because we are going back to the office at least three days a week,"" he was quoted as saying.

This comes amid reports that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: ), the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system. The bank is reportedly developing a digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements, pending approval from U.S. regulators.

Meanwhile on Thursday, a new accounting rule was announced that could see tech giants such as Google (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) reporting on Bitcoin and other altcoins in their balance sheets. The rule mandates companies to declare their crypto holdings at fair value. This development is expected to attract more institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin. Companies can adopt this new standard as early as next year, although it will officially be effective after December 15, 2024.

Jeff Rundlet, head of accounting strategy at Cryptio, hailed this decision as a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He further explained that this proposal could assist large corporations that have been hesitant to hold crypto on their balance sheet due to technical complexities.

The new requirement demands that companies make a distinct entry for crypto assets in their balance sheet and ensure annual disclosure of changes in their crypto assets opening and closing balances. However, there are some exemptions such as the immediate conversion of Bitcoin to cash.

Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy's CEO, welcomed this change stating ""Fair value accounting is coming to Bitcoin. This upgrade to FASB accounting rules eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of BTC as a treasury asset.""

This move might also lead to heavyweight companies like Apple including crypto assets in their balance sheet. In 2021, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed owning Bitcoin or when asked about it.

The market is also anticipating a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding BlackRock (NYSE: )'s application to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), submitted on June 15.

“Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,” they wrote in a report to clients.

Companies that integrate generative AI into their business practices can benefit from faster product and content introductions, leading to higher revenues and 20-30% lower costs, according to the analysts.

“In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, tech-enhanced competitors will put companies out of business that aren't equally tech-first, in our view. Using generative AI to drive higher ROICs in media and internet will become table stakes within 3-5 years, we estimate. Use it or lose it (via bankruptcy) is our key investment conclusion,” they added.

While the analysts say it’s hard to pick winners and losers now, they believe that clear winners could prove to be “the arms dealers that house large language models (LLMs).”

“Today, the 3 LLM front-runners are , and . We believe these 3 companies will grow their market caps to be larger than AAPL's $3T.”

The analysts argue that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is “not a core beneficiary of the trend toward generative AI because it is not an arms dealer.”

“We assume AAPL can protect its best-in-class ecosystem from defections, but we believe Android/GOOGL will grow to be a larger company driven by its Cloud business, generative AI capabilities, and best in class 1st-party global consumer data,” they concluded."

The annual subscriptions will not renew at the end of their terms.

“Please contact the publisher directly to cancel your Print Newsstand subscription,” the company said.

A recent editorial in the August issue of Fantasy Magazine read that it is with “real sadness that we have to announce that October 2022 will be our last issue”.

“People will want to know why, of course, and the answer is the expected one: Unfortunately Fantasy never reached a point of paying for itself, and with the Kindle Periodicals mess it’s just not sustainable,” it added.

Last March, Amazon announced it will stop all of its print and Kindle magazine and newspaper subscriptions from next year.

“Since that announcement, independent publishers have been scrambling to figure out how to make up for the loss in income that would ensue when many of their subscribers would suddenly disappear,” reports The Verge.

(AMZN) and its Counterfeit Crimes Unit (CCU) today announced the filing of two new lawsuits against Kamryn Russell, Ashley Hawat, and their co-conspirators who knowingly attempted to evade Amazon’s brand protection systems in an effort to promote, advertise, and facilitate the sale of counterfeit luxury fashion goods such as jewelry, handbags, and accessories.

Amazon works across the globe to fight counterfeiters, filing joint lawsuits with brands to eliminate the sale of counterfeits not only in Amazon's store but across the supply chain. Through its partnership with brands of all sizes, Amazon’s CCU constantly uncovers new approaches counterfeiters take to try to deceive customers and evade the law. The CCU uses that intelligence to equip law enforcement to pursue bad actors. In 2022, the CCU sued or referred for investigation over 1,300 criminals in the U.S., UK, EU, and China.

In this case, both Russell and Hawat attempted to use a “hidden links” scheme in which they posted links on their social media pages that directed their followers to seemingly generic product listing pages in the Amazon store. Russell and Hawat’s co-conspirators disguised the infringing nature of the products they were selling in order to avoid detection by Amazon and the brand, often by blurring the brand’s logo. Russell and Hawat’s social media posts then made it clear to their followers that if they purchased these seemingly non-infringing and non-branded products, they would actually receive counterfeit luxury products. These bad actors also urged their followers to buy these products before Amazon could take down the listings.

In social media posts from Hawat, she explicitly acknowledges Amazon’s efforts to remove the infringing products and demonstrates her awareness of the illicit nature of the hidden links scheme. In the post she writes in reference to a luxury beach bag, “[Amazon] will be taking down so quickly!! Ordering this now!!” In a similar post where Hawat lists multiple counterfeit items she was promoting, she notes “& that’s really it for Amazon! Links get taken down so fast! So far that’s all that’s back up!”

When Russell or Hawat’s followers used the posted links to purchase the counterfeit products, Russell and Hawat received a commission for that sale. Russell and Hawat not only attempted to profit off of the sale of fake goods that could damage the reputations of the multiple luxury brands they counterfeited, but their actions also negatively impact the thousands of legitimate content creators who have cultivated strong communities built upon trust.

Amazon strongly supports legitimate content creators who strive to help their followers discover new products and experiences, and the company will continue to pursue the small number of bad actors who would attempt to illicitly gain influence and profit by knowingly evading Amazon’s controls and promoting counterfeit products.

“These bad actors knew exactly what they were doing when they attempted to evade Amazon’s brand protection systems to sell counterfeit products that clearly infringed on brands’ intellectual property rights,” said Kebharu Smith, director of Amazon’s CCU. “Content creators serve an important role for consumers around the globe, and these lawsuits not only seek to protect Amazon and the affected brands, but also seek to hold accountable those who diminish the role of legitimate content creators.”

These lawsuits follow similar actions taken by the CCU, including a lawsuit against other bad actors who attempted to implement a hidden links scheme through social media channels. The lawsuit resulted in a 2021 settlement, and Amazon donated settlement payments to the International Trademark Association’s Unreal Campaign that educates 14 to 23 year olds on the importance of intellectual property rights. Amazon’s CCU also filed a joint lawsuit in June 2022 with luxury brand Cartier against an individual and eight associated businesses for a similar hidden links scheme.

The lawsuits were filed in the federal U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington under case numbers:

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

Google responded to the announcement in a blog post, saying it will continue to work closely with EU Commission and ""other stakeholders"" as it ""review[s] our designation decision and assess[es] its implications."""
2022-09-06, IANS,EU designates 6 Big Tech gatekeepers under DMA with provisions for hefty fines,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-designates-6-big-tech-gatekeepers-under-dma-with-provisions-for-hefty-fines-3798651,"London, Sep 6 (IANS) The European Commission on Wednesday designated, for the first time, six gatekeepers -- Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ: )'s parent company), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) -- under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with provisions for hefty penalties for non-compliance.In total, 22 core platform services provided by gatekeepers have been designated in the EU.

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

The blue-chip closed almost 200 points, or 0.6%, lower on Tuesday, the start of a holiday-shortened week, while the tech-heavy dropped 0.1% and the broad-based fell 0.4%.

Rising oil prices weigh on sentiment

Weighing on global sentiment this week has been a sharp rise in oil prices after major producers Saudi Arabia and Russia unexpectedly extended their voluntary supply cuts to the end of the year.

Although crude has slipped back Wednesday, with the WTI contract 0.3% lower at $86.42 a barrel and the contract down 0.5% to $89.61, investors are concerned that the jump in oil prices to their highest level this year with have an impact on inflation and thus how the Federal Reserve will move interest rates going forward.

The is widely seen as holding off on another interest rate increase in September, with Governor saying on Tuesday the latest round of economic data was giving the U.S. central bank space to see if it needs to raise interest rates again.

Fed’s Beige Book to illustrate economic backdrop

There is more data due Wednesday, including the Fed's survey of its 12 district banks which will provide investors with an on-the-ground glimpse at economic conditions around the country.

The is projected to come in at 52.5 in August, down from 52.7 in the prior month. This figure serves as a gauge of activity in the services industry, a crucial sector that accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economy.

Investors will also get the chance to hear from several Fed speakers during the coming week, with Dallas Fed President due later Wednesday.

Economic news from Europe and China has been disappointing this week, and that tone continued Wednesday with retail sales in the eurozone falling and German factory orders slumping in July.

Big tech in spotlight after EC ‘gatekeeper’ label

In corporate news, the tech sector will be in focus after the European Commission designated Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), along with China’s ByteDance, as “gatekeepers” under its new Digital Markets Act.

These companies will be required to make their messaging apps interoperate with rivals and let users decide which apps to pre-install on their devices. They will also not be allowed to favor their own services over rivals' or prevent users from removing pre-installed software or apps.

Elsewhere, GameStop (NYSE: ), ChargePoint (NYSE: ) and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: ) are among the companies slated to report earnings after the close.

Manchester United (NYSE: ) will also be in focus after the English soccer club’s stock fell 18% on Tuesday, the steepest one-day decline, following a report that its owners, the Glazer family, are going to take the club off the market, having failed to get close to their anticipated asking price.

The recent meeting between the e-commerce giant's lawyers and agency officials failed to resolve the impasse. During the talks that took place last month, Amazon's legal team reportedly did not offer to make any concessions.

The FTC is now planning to file its lawsuit against Amazon later this month after conducting an investigation into various aspects of the company’s business practices, including concerns about whether the company gives preferential treatment to its own products on its platforms and how it treats external sellers on Amazon.com.

The incoming lawsuit is expected to target several of Amazon's business practices, including its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics program and the pricing strategies employed by third-party sellers on Amazon.com.

BofA analysts believe that a settlement is “unlikely”, however, they didn’t rule it out from happening.

“While we acknowledge the importance of Amazon’s 3P commission and advertising businesses (which potentially supplies 100%+ of Amazon’s retail profitability) and the potential headline risk due to a drawn out legal process, we think Street will see a tough road ahead for the FTC,” they wrote in a report commenting on the WSJ article.

“E-commerce giant’s lawyers offered no concessions in talks with agency officials last month,” the report mentioned.

The meeting was “a chance for the technology giant to make its case to the regulator to head off a possible lawsuit that officials have been working on for many months”.

The commission has been examining Amazon practices, including whether it favours its own products over competitors’ on its platforms and how it treats outside sellers on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ).

“The lawsuit will target a number of Amazon’s business practices, such as its Fulfillment by Amazon logistics programme and pricing on Amazon.com by third-party sellers,” the report said, citing people aware of the matter.

According to an earlier report in Politico, the lawsuit might lead to a court-ordered “restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire”.

“The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services,” said the report that came out in July.

On Amazon Prime, the FTC is concerned that the “bundle of services is used to illegally cement the company’s market power”.

The FTC in June sued the e-commerce giant Amazon over alleged 'deceptive' tactics to sign up customers for its Prime service.

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

An Amazon spokesperson had said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,Amazon AWS Selected by The BMW Group to Power Next-Generation Automated Driving Platform,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-aws-selected-by-the-bmw-group-to-power-nextgeneration-automated-driving-platform-432SI-3797307,"Amazon Web Services (AWS) (AMZN) today announced the BMW Group has chosen AWS as the preferred cloud provider for its automated driving platform. The BMW Group will develop its next-generation advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) using AWS to help innovate new features for its next generation of vehicles, the “Neue Klasse,” set to launch in 2025. The new cloud-based system will leverage BMW's pre-existing Cloud Data Hub on AWS, and will use AWS compute, generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning, and storage capabilities to help accelerate the delivery of highly automated BMW vehicles.

“In the next decade, consumer habits and expectations will drive more changes in the automotive industry than we’ve seen over the past 30 years,” said Dr. Nicolai Martin, senior vice president of Driving Experience at BMW Group. “This is just the beginning of a new era of highly automated driving, fueled by innovations in technology and engineering. By collaborating with AWS, the BMW Group, along with our partner, Qualcomm Technologies, is building our new automated driving platform on AWS’s scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure. We’re tapping into AWS’s ability to help empower the next generation of BMW’s automated driving and parking functions.”

ADAS supports today’s drivers with early warning systems and capabilities that make driving safer and more comfortable. These systems use advanced software and onboard sensors to provide driver warnings, automated braking, and steering functions designed to help improve a vehicle’s performance on the road. By developing the next generation ADAS platform on AWS, the BMW Group’s engineers can respond more quickly to customer demands and deliver new features to help improve the driving experience. This efficiency, supported by the cloud, will help BMW continue to innovate features for its Neue Klasse of vehicles and keep drivers focused on the experience on the road.

The BMW Group has also joined Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., to co-develop next-generation automated driving systems based on the open and modular Snapdragon Ride Platform. The systems feature an integrated Ride Vision software stack to enable 360-degree perception for the vehicle. Together with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW Group’s engineers have access to leading hardware, vision software, and cloud capabilities in an end-to-end automated driving development platform. Placing the BMW Group’s automated driving platform in the cloud helps break down development silos within vehicle software teams at the BMW Group and helps foster greater global collaboration with suppliers to accelerate automated driving innovation.

“As the automotive industry evolves toward a new high-performance, low-power, and highly scalable software-defined vehicle architecture, we are proud to continue our long-standing, strategic cooperation with the BMW Group to codevelop safer and more secure AI-powered driver assistance technologies at scale,” said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of Automotive and Cloud Computing at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. ""The Qualcomm® Cloud AI 100 solution and Snapdragon Ride Platforms help deliver automotive innovation to the BMW Group and leading brands across the globe. This strategic relationship with AWS and BMW brings together leading-edge technologies from our respective industries to deliver a modern cloud-native software development environment.""

The BMW Group will also use AWS to help scale its capacity to handle vast increases in data creation and usage within automated driving feature development. As automakers deploy higher-level automated driving functions, such as adaptive cruise control, parking assist, and piloted driving, the vehicles create more data for engineering teams to analyze and utilize within future feature development. This cloud-based infrastructure will help provide the foundation for the BMW Group to develop and deliver new functions for its vehicles, such as lane departure assist, automated lane change, or hands-free driving functions, even faster.

AWS services will help power this new scalable, automated driving platform based on a common reference architecture, accelerating the development life cycle and broadening it across BMW models. For example, the platform provides the framework needed to process, catalog, and store millions of miles of real-time driving data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Engineers and data scientists can then search, identify, and visualize relevant driving scenes to develop and train models using Amazon SageMaker, AWS’s service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models in the cloud and on the edge. Engineers can also develop large-scale simulations on AWS compute instances for verification. With this approach, the BMW Group can test and validate new software versions more efficiently, helping to ensure the system’s safety and shortening time to market.

“Automated driving is about more than just convenience; it’s also aimed at providing driver assistance technology that helps prevents injuries and saves lives,” said Wendy Bauer, general manager of Automotive and Manufacturing at AWS. “Implementing these systems on the BMW Group’s international scale requires an approach that can process and analyze vast amounts of data, as well as learn and innovate, so automakers can develop safer and more reliable automated and ADAS systems. Working with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW Group has the tools required to help make its vision of providing safe, premium quality, high performance, and highly automated driving functions to its customers a reality.”"

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are “privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren’t large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act”.

Microsoft is “unlikely” to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

However, it argues that Bing’s relatively small share in the global search market (compared to Google (NASDAQ: )) could only be further diminished with the new rules.

Apple is also reportedly working on ways that will open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloading to comply with new rules.

However, according to the report, the tech giant argues that iMessage shouldn’t have to “interoperate with other messaging services”.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

""To protect the region from the impacts of climate change and preserve biodiversity, we will need both large-scale and local action - and we're committed to investing in both,"" Kara Hurst, Amazon's Global VP for Sustainability, said in a statement.

Amazon's direct contribution will allow CWS to partner with 2,000 family farms and plant 3,00,000 trees over three years.

CWS will also use project funds to develop state-of-the-art monitoring systems using drone and remote sensing technology and on-the-ground surveys to verify program outcomes, advancing research on the potential positive impact of farmers on reforestation opportunities.

""Amazon’s support enables us to plan and build a programme that is self-sustaining in the long term. The farmers will receive upfront support to select tree types that serve both their livelihoods and the wildlife, whilst also receiving technical assistance, agroforestry training, and support for replanting failed saplings,"" said CWS Executive Director Dr Krithi Karanth.

Further investments in projects located in India and other APAC countries will be announced in the coming months, the company said.

This funding comes from Amazon's $100 million Right Now Climate Fund, which was established in 2019 to support nature conservation and restoration projects that improve climate resilience and biodiversity while driving social and environmental benefits in the communities where they operate.

“In the next decade, consumer habits and expectations will drive more changes in the automotive industry than we’ve seen over the past 30 years,” said Dr. Nicolai Martin, senior vice president of Driving Experience at BMW Group. “This is just the beginning of a new era of highly automated driving, fueled by innovations in technology and engineering. By collaborating with AWS, the BMW Group, along with our partner, Qualcomm Technologies, is building our new automated driving platform on AWS’s scalable, secure, and reliable infrastructure. We’re tapping into AWS’s ability to help empower the next generation of BMW’s automated driving and parking functions.”

ADAS supports today’s drivers with early warning systems and capabilities that make driving safer and more comfortable. These systems use advanced software and onboard sensors to provide driver warnings, automated braking, and steering functions designed to help improve a vehicle’s performance on the road. By developing the next generation ADAS platform on AWS, the BMW Group’s engineers can respond more quickly to customer demands and deliver new features to help improve the driving experience. This efficiency, supported by the cloud, will help BMW continue to innovate features for its Neue Klasse of vehicles and keep drivers focused on the experience on the road.

The BMW Group has also joined Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., to co-develop next-generation automated driving systems based on the open and modular Snapdragon Ride Platform. The systems feature an integrated Ride Vision software stack to enable 360-degree perception for the vehicle. Together with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW Group’s engineers have access to leading hardware, vision software, and cloud capabilities in an end-to-end automated driving development platform. Placing the BMW Group’s automated driving platform in the cloud helps break down development silos within vehicle software teams at the BMW Group and helps foster greater global collaboration with suppliers to accelerate automated driving innovation.

“As the automotive industry evolves toward a new high-performance, low-power, and highly scalable software-defined vehicle architecture, we are proud to continue our long-standing, strategic cooperation with the BMW Group to codevelop safer and more secure AI-powered driver assistance technologies at scale,” said Nakul Duggal, senior vice president and general manager of Automotive and Cloud Computing at Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. ""The Qualcomm® Cloud AI 100 solution and Snapdragon Ride Platforms help deliver automotive innovation to the BMW Group and leading brands across the globe. This strategic relationship with AWS and BMW brings together leading-edge technologies from our respective industries to deliver a modern cloud-native software development environment.""

The BMW Group will also use AWS to help scale its capacity to handle vast increases in data creation and usage within automated driving feature development. As automakers deploy higher-level automated driving functions, such as adaptive cruise control, parking assist, and piloted driving, the vehicles create more data for engineering teams to analyze and utilize within future feature development. This cloud-based infrastructure will help provide the foundation for the BMW Group to develop and deliver new functions for its vehicles, such as lane departure assist, automated lane change, or hands-free driving functions, even faster.

AWS services will help power this new scalable, automated driving platform based on a common reference architecture, accelerating the development life cycle and broadening it across BMW models. For example, the platform provides the framework needed to process, catalog, and store millions of miles of real-time driving data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). Engineers and data scientists can then search, identify, and visualize relevant driving scenes to develop and train models using Amazon SageMaker, AWS’s service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models in the cloud and on the edge. Engineers can also develop large-scale simulations on AWS compute instances for verification. With this approach, the BMW Group can test and validate new software versions more efficiently, helping to ensure the system’s safety and shortening time to market.

“Automated driving is about more than just convenience; it’s also aimed at providing driver assistance technology that helps prevents injuries and saves lives,” said Wendy Bauer, general manager of Automotive and Manufacturing at AWS. “Implementing these systems on the BMW Group’s international scale requires an approach that can process and analyze vast amounts of data, as well as learn and innovate, so automakers can develop safer and more reliable automated and ADAS systems. Working with AWS and Qualcomm Technologies, the BMW Group has the tools required to help make its vision of providing safe, premium quality, high performance, and highly automated driving functions to its customers a reality.”"

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are “privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren’t large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act”.

Microsoft is “unlikely” to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

However, it argues that Bing’s relatively small share in the global search market (compared to Google (NASDAQ: )) could only be further diminished with the new rules.

Apple is also reportedly working on ways that will open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloading to comply with new rules.

However, according to the report, the tech giant argues that iMessage shouldn’t have to “interoperate with other messaging services”.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

Mississauga, home to nearly 1,000 IT companies with over 300,000 tech professionals, and Montreal, where tech ecosystems have grown around 31 per cent from 2015 to 2020, were among the top Canadian cities to tap the talent.

""The large migration of tech workers fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada’s tech occupation workforce,"" the report titled 'Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic', said.

According to migration findings, a total of 1,900 tech workers from across the world came to Mississauga and 959 came to Montreal from April 2022-March 2022.

While the global net in-migration of tech talent came primarily from India, Nigeria, and Brazil, Canada is also gaining American talent, which includes Indians, from major US cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, the report said.

In a bid to attract top tech talent to the country, Canada has started giving open work permits for H1-B visa holders from the US.

Indians, who account for nearly 75 per cent of H1-B visa holders in the US, will be the major beneficiaries of this scheme.

Canada’s tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from the Business Development Bank of Canada.

“It’s past the time to disagree and commit. If you can’t disagree and commit, it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon because we are going back to the office at least three days a week,” he was quoted as saying.

Jassy said his decision to have employees return to the office was a “judgment call” and that employees can leave if they don’t want to comply.

“It’s not right for all of our teammates to be in (the office) three days a week and for people to refuse to do so,” the Amazon CEO added.

Amazon is reportedly cracking down on employees who refuse to return to the office.

In July, leaked messages seen by Insider suggested that Amazon would force a “voluntary resignation” on employees who don’t relocate to the in-person hubs.

As per the e-commerce giant's guidelines, remote workers are expected to join a main Amazon hub by the first half of 2024.

""Those who are unwilling or unable to comply are being forced to find work elsewhere, and some are choosing to quit,"" earlier reports mentioned.

A company spokesperson had confirmed the relocation policy, saying it affects a small percentage of the company's workforce.

""It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach, so we decided that the best thing to do was to communicate directly with teams and individuals who are affected to ensure they’re getting accurate information that’s relevant to them,"" the spokesperson had said in a statement.

For employees affected by the relocation policy, Amazon is asking that they move to a designated hub, which could be Seattle, Arlington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco or another main office.

""Some employees see it as a stark reversal from the company's approach during the pandemic,"" according to reports.

On May 31, hundreds of Amazon employees staged a walkout at the company’s headquarters in Seattle over the company’s return-to-work policy and its lack of progress on climate change initiatives.

Amazon mandated its return-to-office policy from May 1, with employees required to be back in offices at least three days per week.

Mississauga, home to nearly 1,000 IT companies with over 300,000 tech professionals, and Montreal, where tech ecosystems have grown around 31 per cent from 2015 to 2020, were among the top Canadian cities to tap the talent.

""The large migration of tech workers fills the need for skilled workers amid an ongoing global talent shortage and points to a hopeful and prosperous future for Canada’s tech occupation workforce,"" the report titled 'Tech Workforce Trends: The Migration of Tech Workers and Tech Jobs Since The Pandemic', said.

According to migration findings, a total of 1,900 tech workers from across the world came to Mississauga and 959 came to Montreal from April 2022-March 2022.

While the global net in-migration of tech talent came primarily from India, Nigeria, and Brazil, Canada is also gaining American talent, which includes Indians, from major US cities like Washington D.C., Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia, the report said.

In a bid to attract top tech talent to the country, Canada has started giving open work permits for H1-B visa holders from the US.

Indians, who account for nearly 75 per cent of H1-B visa holders in the US, will be the major beneficiaries of this scheme.

Canada’s tech ecosystem is on the fast track to immense growth according to a recent industry outlook report from the Business Development Bank of Canada.

Revenues in the tech sector grew at an average annual pace of 9.4 per cent between 2015 and 2020, and in 2022, Canada had more than 400,000 software developers in the country.

The report also found that the most sought-after tech skills in Canada include customer experience, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure, analytical skills, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) web services, Jira, data science, GitHub, and Customer Relationship Management.

This new study was first spotted by The Verge.

""Google has one of the most balanced or consistent pay bands among Big Tech companies. This means it's rare for someone at a lower job level to get paid more than someone at a higher level,"" the study said.

""Meta engineers appear to level up the fastest and have some of the highest pay,"" it added.

The data is based on compensation packages self-reported by Blind users from January of last year to this month.

Moreover, the study showed that Amazon’s promotions can take longer than its peers, and its pay ranges for engineers are the widest.

In addition, Microsoft has several job levels for software engineers, which may allow the company to give out more promotions.

""Microsoft has many job levels for software engineers, which might give the company more flexibility to hand out more promotions. However, their total compensation is lower than their peers across the board up until staff software engineer,"" the study stated.

Recently, a Google software engineer in his 20s has said that he works for only an hour a day and earns a salary of $150,000 (about Rs 1.2 crore) yearly.

Devon explained that he starts his week by writing code for ""a decent part"" of any given task before sending it off to his manager.

He had interned at Google and knew that if he got the job, he would not have to work very hard.

2022-08-29, IANS,It’s past the time to disagree and commit: Amazon CEO tells remote employees,https://in.investing.com/news/its-past-the-time-to-disagree-and-commit-amazon-ceo-tells-remote-employees-3788273,"San Francisco, Aug 29 (IANS) As several Amazon (NASDAQ: ) workers have reportedly chosen to quit rather than relocate to various main work hubs, the company’s CEO Andy Jassy has a stern message for those who don’t want to return to work.According to a report from Insider, Jassy told employees who don’t want to return to the office that “it’s not going to work out for you”.

“It’s past the time to disagree and commit. If you can’t disagree and commit, it’s probably not going to work out for you at Amazon because we are going back to the office at least three days a week,” he was quoted as saying.

Jassy said his decision to have employees return to the office was a “judgment call” and that employees can leave if they don’t want to comply.

“It’s not right for all of our teammates to be in (the office) three days a week and for people to refuse to do so,” the Amazon CEO added.

Amazon is reportedly cracking down on employees who refuse to return to the office.

In July, leaked messages seen by Insider suggested that Amazon would force a “voluntary resignation” on employees who don’t relocate to the in-person hubs.

As per the e-commerce giant's guidelines, remote workers are expected to join a main Amazon hub by the first half of 2024.

""Those who are unwilling or unable to comply are being forced to find work elsewhere, and some are choosing to quit,"" earlier reports mentioned.

A company spokesperson had confirmed the relocation policy, saying it affects a small percentage of the company's workforce.

""It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach, so we decided that the best thing to do was to communicate directly with teams and individuals who are affected to ensure they’re getting accurate information that’s relevant to them,"" the spokesperson had said in a statement.

For employees affected by the relocation policy, Amazon is asking that they move to a designated hub, which could be Seattle, Arlington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco or another main office.

""Some employees see it as a stark reversal from the company's approach during the pandemic,"" according to reports.

On May 31, hundreds of Amazon employees staged a walkout at the company’s headquarters in Seattle over the company’s return-to-work policy and its lack of progress on climate change initiatives.

Amazon mandated its return-to-office policy from May 1, with employees required to be back in offices at least three days per week.

The e-commerce giant has also laid off 27,000 employees in two job cut announcements.

For Amazon, Tata Motors (NS: ) tailored the 210 cubic feet, more-than-120-kilometre range Tata Ace four-wheeler EVs that operate at a significantly lower total cost of ownership compared to traditional diesel vans in Amazon’s delivery network.

""We are working with almost every electric vehicle manufacturer in India that has the potential to meet the demand from Amazon and its delivery service partners,” Abhinav Singh, VP of Customer Fulfilment, Amazon Transportation Services, Global Specialty Fulfilment, and Supply Chain at Amazon India, said in a statement.

Over the last few years, Amazon has helped to deploy electric vehicles, charging stations, and financing services with key industry players, including Eicher Trucks and Buses, Altigreen, Mahindra Electric, TATA Motors, TVS, Magenta Mobility, Sun Mobility, and more.

Moreover, the company said it is committed to leveraging technologies such as low-carbon fuels, embracing energy-efficient innovations, and investing in renewable energy projects to reduce emissions from electricity generation.

The company is also committed to decarbonising trucking in its middle-mile and last-mile operations by piloting scalable carbon reduction technologies, as well as teaming up with energy infrastructure and financing companies to help create bundled solutions for transporters looking to switch to electric trucks.

California-based Nvidia, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has become a focal point in a surge in excitement over the nascent technology.

Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market value to above $1 trillion, on par with tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, a euphoria that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap companies, which include Nvidia, have helped spur on a more than 14% jump in the benchmark this year.

Analysts have said that Nvidia's numbers and the outlook for the rest of the year could thus influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to have posted revenue of $11.04 billion in its second quarter. Nearly three-fourths of the top-line figure is expected to consist of revenue from Nvidia's crucial data center business, which houses its all-important H100 chip used in AI-fueled platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

In a recent note to clients, analysts at Piper Sandler said they believe the conversation around Nvidia will ""boil down to the data center"" unit.

With this launch, the tech giant aims to enable its sellers to meet the consumer demands for high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables while shopping on Amazon Fresh.

“The shelf monitoring solution will bolster the capabilities of Amazon Fresh sellers to fulfil the commitment of delivering the finest grocery services in India. With seamless automation, the solutions ensure top-notch quality of fresh produce, enhancing customer satisfaction,” Rajeev Rastogi, Vice President, Machine Learning, Amazon, said in a statement.

Store shelf monitoring solution is powered by state of art computer vision models and Wi-Fi-enabled IoT cameras to detect pre-determined defects in fruits and vegetables using the image of the crate, as an input.

The solution detects the count of visible items of produce and identifies specific visual defects such as cuts, cracks, and pressure damage among others, the company said.

Amazon has developed two types of models -- one for detecting each item in the crate and counting the total number of items, and a second to identify the defect classes present in each item.

Both these models are trained using annotated defects in millions of produced images. “Our focus has always been customer backwards and we are providing our Amazon Fresh customers consistent and superior quality of fresh produce across India,” said Harsh Goyal, Director and Head of Everyday Essentials, Amazon India.

Moreover, the tech giant said that the shelf monitoring solution currently supports manual monitoring through a mobile app and automated monitoring using cameras installed on top of produce shelves.

In manual monitoring, operators use the Johari app to submit a produce crate image taken freely from their smartphone. The shelf monitoring solution assesses the image for quality and if acceptable analyses the image to detect defects and uses grading logic to highlight the items that don’t meet the quality criteria and need to be culled.

Shares in Nvidia have tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market capitalization to above $1 trillion - a valuation approaching tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ). The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, an excitement that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally earlier this summer.

For these reasons, analysts claim that Nvidia's returns and its outlook for the rest of the year could influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

2. Fed's Barkin warns of 'reacceleration' as Jackson Hole looms

The Federal Reserve must be ready to address a reacceleration in the U.S. economy despite an unprecedented series of aggressive hikes aimed at corralling and slowing growth, according to Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

Speaking with Reuters on Tuesday, Barkin pointed to recent data showing hotter-than-expected and increasing consumer confidence as hints that the economy could remain strong even as prices stay elevated.

Such a scenario, Barkin flagged, may indicate a wider ""playing field"" of outcomes beyond a recession or a so-called ""soft landing,"" which would see the Fed cool inflation without sparking an economic meltdown. It may also support the case for more monetary policy tightening, Barkin suggested.

The comments come ahead of a highly anticipated economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver remarks on Friday, with traders keen to receive any update on the central bank's outlook for inflation. Last week, minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that most policymakers believe more rate rises may be required to address lingering ""upside risks"" to inflation -- a statement that has helped fuel a recent surge in bond yields.

""Those who are unwilling or unable to comply are being forced to find work elsewhere, and some are choosing to quit,"" the report mentioned.

A company spokesperson confirmed the relocation policy, saying it affects a small percentage of the company's workforce.

""It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach, so we decided that the best thing to do was to communicate directly with teams and individuals who are affected to ensure they’re getting accurate information that’s relevant to them,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""If an individual feels like they don't have the information they need, we encourage them to talk with their HR business partner or their manager,"" the spokesperson added.

For employees affected by the relocation policy, Amazon is asking that they move to a designated hub, which could be Seattle, Arlington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco or another main office.

""Some employees see it as a stark reversal from the company's approach during the pandemic,"" the report noted.

In some cases, staffers are being asked to move out of state, which would require them to break their housing lease, or transition their children to new schools, the report said.

On May 31, hundreds of Amazon employees staged a walkout at the company’s headquarters in Seattle over the company’s return-to-work policy and its lack of progress on climate change initiatives.

According to GeekWire, the walkout by corporate and tech employees at Amazon HQ late on Wednesday may have looked like several thousand participants.

Amazon mandated its return-to-office policy from May 1, with employees required to be back in offices at least three days per week. The e-commerce giant has also laid off 27,000 employees in two job cut announcements.

However, thousands of corporate and tech employees weren’t thrilled to return to work.

The e-commerce giant employs more than 65,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region.

California-based Nvidia, which manufactures the graphics processors that power generative artificial intelligence, has become a focal point in a surge in excitement over the nascent technology.

Nvidia's share price has tripled this year, thanks in large part to a stellar forecast in May that propelled the stock's market value to above $1 trillion, on par with tech industry behemoths like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The announcement initiated a fresh wave of hype around AI's potentially game-changing applications, a euphoria that in turn pushed up other Big Tech players and drove a broader stock market rally. The so-called Magnificent Seven group of megacap companies, which include Nvidia, have helped spur on a more than 14% jump in the benchmark this year.

Analysts have said that Nvidia's numbers and the outlook for the rest of the year could thus influence the near-term course of not only the AI boom but broader market sentiment.

According to Bloomberg consensus estimates, Nvidia is projected to have posted revenue of $11.04 billion in its second quarter.

With this launch, the tech giant aims to enable its sellers to meet the consumer demands for high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables while shopping on Amazon Fresh.

“The shelf monitoring solution will bolster the capabilities of Amazon Fresh sellers to fulfil the commitment of delivering the finest grocery services in India. With seamless automation, the solutions ensure top-notch quality of fresh produce, enhancing customer satisfaction,” Rajeev Rastogi, Vice President, Machine Learning, Amazon, said in a statement.

Store shelf monitoring solution is powered by state of art computer vision models and Wi-Fi-enabled IoT cameras to detect pre-determined defects in fruits and vegetables using the image of the crate, as an input.

The solution detects the count of visible items of produce and identifies specific visual defects such as cuts, cracks, and pressure damage among others, the company said.

Amazon has developed two types of models -- one for detecting each item in the crate and counting the total number of items, and a second to identify the defect classes present in each item.

Both these models are trained using annotated defects in millions of produced images. “Our focus has always been customer backwards and we are providing our Amazon Fresh customers consistent and superior quality of fresh produce across India,” said Harsh Goyal, Director and Head of Everyday Essentials, Amazon India.

Moreover, the tech giant said that the shelf monitoring solution currently supports manual monitoring through a mobile app and automated monitoring using cameras installed on top of produce shelves.

In manual monitoring, operators use the Johari app to submit a produce crate image taken freely from their smartphone. The shelf monitoring solution assesses the image for quality and if acceptable analyses the image to detect defects and uses grading logic to highlight the items that don’t meet the quality criteria and need to be culled.

The Federal Reserve must be ready to address a reacceleration in the U.S. economy despite an unprecedented series of aggressive hikes aimed at corralling and slowing growth, according to Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.

Speaking with Reuters on Tuesday, Barkin pointed to recent data showing hotter-than-expected and increasing consumer confidence as hints that the economy could remain strong even as prices stay elevated.

Such a scenario, Barkin flagged, may indicate a wider ""playing field"" of outcomes beyond a recession or a so-called ""soft landing,"" which would see the Fed cool inflation without sparking an economic meltdown. It may also support the case for more monetary policy tightening, Barkin suggested.

The comments come ahead of a highly anticipated economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver remarks on Friday, with traders keen to receive any update on the central bank's outlook for inflation. Last week, minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that most policymakers believe more rate rises may be required to address lingering ""upside risks"" to inflation -- a statement that has helped fuel a recent surge in bond yields.

Oil prices inched lower Wednesday despite another fall in U.S. crude stocks, although trading ranges remain tight ahead of the Jackson Hole symposium.

""Those who are unwilling or unable to comply are being forced to find work elsewhere, and some are choosing to quit,"" the report mentioned.

A company spokesperson confirmed the relocation policy, saying it affects a small percentage of the company's workforce.

""It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach, so we decided that the best thing to do was to communicate directly with teams and individuals who are affected to ensure they’re getting accurate information that’s relevant to them,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.

""If an individual feels like they don't have the information they need, we encourage them to talk with their HR business partner or their manager,"" the spokesperson added.

For employees affected by the relocation policy, Amazon is asking that they move to a designated hub, which could be Seattle, Arlington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco or another main office.

""Some employees see it as a stark reversal from the company's approach during the pandemic,"" the report noted.

In some cases, staffers are being asked to move out of state, which would require them to break their housing lease, or transition their children to new schools, the report said.

On May 31, hundreds of Amazon employees staged a walkout at the company’s headquarters in Seattle over the company’s return-to-work policy and its lack of progress on climate change initiatives.

According to GeekWire, the walkout by corporate and tech employees at Amazon HQ late on Wednesday may have looked like several thousand participants.

Amazon mandated its return-to-office policy from May 1, with employees required to be back in offices at least three days per week. The e-commerce giant has also laid off 27,000 employees in two job cut announcements.

However, thousands of corporate and tech employees weren’t thrilled to return to work.

The e-commerce giant employs more than 65,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region.

Academic Joanne Rodda, a senior lecturer in psychiatry at Kent and Medway Medical School, said it showed ""sexism in football was embedded in Alexa”.

""When I asked Alexa about the women's England-Australia football match today it gave me the result,"" she was quoted as saying in the report.

A company spokesperson was quoted as saying that this was an error that has been fixed.

Dr Rodda said it was “pretty sad that after almost a decade of Alexa, it's only today that the AI algorithm has been fixed so that it now recognises woman's World Cup football as football”.

Amazon said it had automated systems which use AI to understand the context and pull out the most relevant information, but the systems got it wrong in this case.

The company added it expected the AI systems to get better over time.

The incident highlights the issue of bias being embedded in systems powered by the booming AI sector, the report noted.

""Out of interest, I just asked Alexa who Arsenal football team are playing in October. It replied with information about the men's team, and wasn't able to give an answer when I asked specifically about women's fixtures,” said Dr Rodda.

The Lionesses beat Australia 3-1.

However, some creators are mocking the low Amazon payouts.

The e-commerce giant is offering $12,500 for a maximum of 500 videos, or $25 per qualifying video, according to an email the company shared with select influencers.

A screenshot of the email shared online read that Amazon is looking for videos that “could be a product review of two or more products, a product comparison video, a ranking video listing the best products in a certain category, or even gift inspiration featuring multiple products”.

Amazon was yet to make an official statement on the payout news.

Some creators went to social media platforms to mock the low payment.

“25$ per job lol Amazon can go find someone else to play that game,” one creator posted on X. “500 videos! Damn that's a full time Job, haha,” another said.

""The viewers of 'made for kids' YouTube videos appear to be clicking on ads, and brands' websites ""are harvesting and sharing meta-data on those viewers with dozens of data brokers upon click through"".

This raises the possibility that brands have ""data poisoned"" their first party datasets with data derived from thousands of viewers of ""made for kids"" videos, the report claimed.

The report further said that some companies appear to be scraping or exfiltrating Google-generated user identifiers from viewers of ""made for kids"" videos who had clicked an ad.

This could hypothetically prevent Google (NASDAQ: ) from being able to fully respond to ""right to know"" or ""right to delete"" requests under privacy laws such as the GDPR or CCPA.

It is unclear if Google is aware of this situation, or if it is a form of ""data leak,"" the report mentioned.

In response to the report, Dan Taylor, Vice President, Global Ads at Google, said that Google works tirelessly to provide a safer experience for kids and teens online.

""Adalytics released a deeply flawed and uninformed report about how we manage advertising on made for kids content on YouTube, and our privacy policies for people under the age of 18 across our platforms,"" Taylor added.

In September 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the People of the State of New York (NY) alleged that YouTube ""collected kid's personal information without parental consent"", in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). YouTube's owner (Google) agreed to pay $170 million to settle the allegations.

Google said that the new report failed to substantiate claims that ""we are in violation of government regulations, such as COPPA, or our own policies around ads personalisation”.

""We have strict ads privacy protections in place on made for kids content, regardless of a user's age,"" the company added.

""This report falsely claims that the presence of cookies indicates a privacy breakdown. The opposite is true, and the report fails to show otherwise,"" it added.

According to an Adalytics report, dozens of major ad tech and data broker companies are receiving data from viewers of ""made for kids"" YouTube videos who clicked on an ad.

“These include several companies who paid penalties for COPPA related enforcements, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and OpenX. Foreign-owned companies such as TikTok are also receiving meta-data from viewers of “made for kids” content from advertisers’ websites,” the report alleged.

Google said that it does not link ""cookies to the viewing of made for kids content for advertising purposes, and a viewer’s activity on made for kids content can't be used for ads personalisation"".

""The cookies identified in this report are encrypted and not usable by another tech company, advertiser, publisher or a data broker. These cookies do not enable brand advertisers to identify who a user is or what video they viewed. We limit age-sensitive ads from appearing next to kids' content,"" Google stressed.

2022-08-18, Investing.com,"Cigna, CVS Health downgraded on competition in pharmacy benefit manager business",https://in.investing.com/news/cigna-cvs-health-downgraded-on-competition-in-pharmacy-benefit-manager-business-3777209,"Investing.com -- Health care stocks were mixed on Friday after analysts downgraded Cigna and CVS Health citing concerns about competition in the pharmacy benefit manager business.

Edward Jones cut its ratings for Cigna Corp (NYSE: ) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: ) to hold from buy. The move comes after CVS lost part of a contract with insurer Blue Shield of California, which has selected Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and a collection of other companies to take on the tasks of a pharmacy benefit manager.

The analysts estimate that Cigna’s pharmacy benefit manager business contributed two-thirds of the insurer’s profit last year, and they noted that while it is just one contract for CVS, Blue Shield of California’s move highlights the growing competitive threat in the business.

While Blue Shield of California’s multi-player model – for example Amazon will provide home delivery of drugs, while other companies will manage claims, and another will negotiate prices – rather than the familiar bundled approach will be complicated to implement. CVS will continue to provide Blue Shield of California with specialty drug services.

But, the analysts said, the new model could weigh on CVS shares. “The BCS contract could also encourage customers to be more aggressive in negotiating future PBM contracts with industry players,” they wrote.

Shares of Cigna closed up 2%, while shares of CVS were flat.

For Cigna, the analysts pointed to opportunities in MedicareAdvantage and biosimilars, which are generic versions of complex injectable drugs. “The health insurance market is growing due to the expansion of MA, and we believe Cigna can increase marketshare,” they said.

As for CVS, the analysts noted that it is also a diverse model, with a retail drugstore business, Aetna health insurance, specialty drug services, and patient care services. That is helping it transform into a one stop shop for health care.

“Over the long term, this integrated strategy should lead to accelerating earnings growth for the company,” they said."

OMRs, typically emergency medical technicians, have sometimes been encouraged to steer workers toward in-house treatment.

“Everything that we were doing was kind of pseudo-medical, enough to have the gloss of being medical,” an EMT (emergency medical technician) who worked in a Nevada AmCare was quoted as saying.

“When we’re in ambulances as EMTs, the entire point is to get people to definitive care. Then I get to Amazon, and it's like, ‘No, we're not getting them to a doctor’. So what did you need me for? I'm the person who gets people to doctors,” the EMT added.

According to the report, AmCare staff are not “qualified to diagnose and treat injuries”.

Officially, they provide only first aid. A company spokesperson disputed the findings, saying the company does not try to hide injuries.

“Any suggestion that we intentionally or systematically delay or discourage employees from seeking needed medical care is false,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

In April, OSHA issued Amazon the third citation in the agency’s 53-year history for medical mismanagement, finding that it seriously endangered employees’ health.

Amazon had already received at least three warnings about AmCare from OSHA dating back to 2016, The Intercept reported.

Amazon’s safety report for 2022 said there was a 23 per cent reduction in recordable injuries for US workers between 2019 and 2022.

2022-08-19, IANS,Amazon Alexa accused of ‘sexist’ reply to question about the Lionesses,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-alexa-accused-of-sexist-reply-to-question-about-the-lionesses-3777610,"London, Aug 19 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Alexa has been accused of sexism after the voice assistant was unable to reply to a question about the Lionesses' semi-final victory during the Women's World Cup.When asked for the result of the England-Australia football match, Alexa said there was no match, reports BBC.

Academic Joanne Rodda, a senior lecturer in psychiatry at Kent and Medway Medical School, said it showed ""sexism in football was embedded in Alexa”.

""When I asked Alexa about the women's England-Australia football match today it gave me the result,"" she was quoted as saying in the report.

A company spokesperson was quoted as saying that this was an error that has been fixed.

Dr Rodda said it was “pretty sad that after almost a decade of Alexa, it's only today that the AI algorithm has been fixed so that it now recognises woman's World Cup football as football”.

Amazon said it had automated systems which use AI to understand the context and pull out the most relevant information, but the systems got it wrong in this case.

The company added it expected the AI systems to get better over time.

The incident highlights the issue of bias being embedded in systems powered by the booming AI sector, the report noted.

""Out of interest, I just asked Alexa who Arsenal football team are playing in October. It replied with information about the men's team, and wasn't able to give an answer when I asked specifically about women's fixtures,” said Dr Rodda.

The Lionesses beat Australia 3-1.

However, some creators are mocking the low Amazon payouts.

The e-commerce giant is offering $12,500 for a maximum of 500 videos, or $25 per qualifying video, according to an email the company shared with select influencers.

A screenshot of the email shared online read that Amazon is looking for videos that “could be a product review of two or more products, a product comparison video, a ranking video listing the best products in a certain category, or even gift inspiration featuring multiple products”.

Amazon was yet to make an official statement on the payout news.

Some creators went to social media platforms to mock the low payment.

“25$ per job lol Amazon can go find someone else to play that game,” one creator posted on X. “500 videos! Damn that's a full time Job, haha,” another said.

Kyndhal, an Amazon influencer and mentor, posted: “Amazon is offering creators up to $12,500 to upload shoppable videos!! If you didn’t catch the last incentive, now is your time!”

A follower reacted: “SOOOOO, up to $25/video, LOL no thanks”.

Amazon launched the “Inspire” feed in December last year. It is an in-app shopping feed that offers personalised suggestions, allowing users to shop for items on the e-commerce platform.

The Amazon feed essentially looks like the feed offered by TikTok and Instagram Reels wherein users get short videos based on their interests.

""The viewers of 'made for kids' YouTube videos appear to be clicking on ads, and brands' websites ""are harvesting and sharing meta-data on those viewers with dozens of data brokers upon click through"".

This raises the possibility that brands have ""data poisoned"" their first party datasets with data derived from thousands of viewers of ""made for kids"" videos, the report claimed.

The report further said that some companies appear to be scraping or exfiltrating Google-generated user identifiers from viewers of ""made for kids"" videos who had clicked an ad.

This could hypothetically prevent Google (NASDAQ: ) from being able to fully respond to ""right to know"" or ""right to delete"" requests under privacy laws such as the GDPR or CCPA.

It is unclear if Google is aware of this situation, or if it is a form of ""data leak,"" the report mentioned.

In response to the report, Dan Taylor, Vice President, Global Ads at Google, said that Google works tirelessly to provide a safer experience for kids and teens online.

""Adalytics released a deeply flawed and uninformed report about how we manage advertising on made for kids content on YouTube, and our privacy policies for people under the age of 18 across our platforms,"" Taylor added.

In September 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the People of the State of New York (NY) alleged that YouTube ""collected kid's personal information without parental consent"", in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). YouTube's owner (Google) agreed to pay $170 million to settle the allegations.

Google said that the new report failed to substantiate claims that ""we are in violation of government regulations, such as COPPA, or our own policies around ads personalisation”.

""We have strict ads privacy protections in place on made for kids content, regardless of a user's age,"" the company added.

""This report falsely claims that the presence of cookies indicates a privacy breakdown. The opposite is true, and the report fails to show otherwise,"" it added.

According to an Adalytics report, dozens of major ad tech and data broker companies are receiving data from viewers of ""made for kids"" YouTube videos who clicked on an ad.

“These include several companies who paid penalties for COPPA related enforcements, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and OpenX. Foreign-owned companies such as TikTok are also receiving meta-data from viewers of “made for kids” content from advertisers’ websites,” the report alleged.

Google said that it does not link ""cookies to the viewing of made for kids content for advertising purposes, and a viewer’s activity on made for kids content can't be used for ads personalisation"".

""The cookies identified in this report are encrypted and not usable by another tech company, advertiser, publisher or a data broker. These cookies do not enable brand advertisers to identify who a user is or what video they viewed. We limit age-sensitive ads from appearing next to kids' content,"" Google stressed.

2022-08-18, Investing.com,"Cigna, CVS Health downgraded on competition in pharmacy benefit manager business",https://in.investing.com/news/cigna-cvs-health-downgraded-on-competition-in-pharmacy-benefit-manager-business-3777209,"Investing.com -- Health care stocks were mixed on Friday after analysts downgraded Cigna and CVS Health citing concerns about competition in the pharmacy benefit manager business.

Edward Jones cut its ratings for Cigna Corp (NYSE: ) and CVS Health Corp (NYSE: ) to hold from buy. The move comes after CVS lost part of a contract with insurer Blue Shield of California, which has selected Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and a collection of other companies to take on the tasks of a pharmacy benefit manager.

The analysts estimate that Cigna’s pharmacy benefit manager business contributed two-thirds of the insurer’s profit last year, and they noted that while it is just one contract for CVS, Blue Shield of California’s move highlights the growing competitive threat in the business.

While Blue Shield of California’s multi-player model – for example Amazon will provide home delivery of drugs, while other companies will manage claims, and another will negotiate prices – rather than the familiar bundled approach will be complicated to implement. CVS will continue to provide Blue Shield of California with specialty drug services.

But, the analysts said, the new model could weigh on CVS shares. “The BCS contract could also encourage customers to be more aggressive in negotiating future PBM contracts with industry players,” they wrote.

Shares of Cigna closed up 2%, while shares of CVS were flat.

For Cigna, the analysts pointed to opportunities in MedicareAdvantage and biosimilars, which are generic versions of complex injectable drugs. “The health insurance market is growing due to the expansion of MA, and we believe Cigna can increase marketshare,” they said.

As for CVS, the analysts noted that it is also a diverse model, with a retail drugstore business, Aetna health insurance, specialty drug services, and patient care services. That is helping it transform into a one stop shop for health care.

“Over the long term, this integrated strategy should lead to accelerating earnings growth for the company,” they said."

OMRs, typically emergency medical technicians, have sometimes been encouraged to steer workers toward in-house treatment.

“Everything that we were doing was kind of pseudo-medical, enough to have the gloss of being medical,” an EMT (emergency medical technician) who worked in a Nevada AmCare was quoted as saying.

“When we’re in ambulances as EMTs, the entire point is to get people to definitive care. Then I get to Amazon, and it's like, ‘No, we're not getting them to a doctor’. So what did you need me for? I'm the person who gets people to doctors,” the EMT added.

According to the report, AmCare staff are not “qualified to diagnose and treat injuries”.

Officially, they provide only first aid. A company spokesperson disputed the findings, saying the company does not try to hide injuries.

“Any suggestion that we intentionally or systematically delay or discourage employees from seeking needed medical care is false,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

In April, OSHA issued Amazon the third citation in the agency’s 53-year history for medical mismanagement, finding that it seriously endangered employees’ health.

Amazon had already received at least three warnings about AmCare from OSHA dating back to 2016, The Intercept reported.

Amazon’s safety report for 2022 said there was a 23 per cent reduction in recordable injuries for US workers between 2019 and 2022.

""Attackers primarily impersonate the brands and entities we trust and rely on. In the majority (60.1 per cent) of cases, attackers pose as one just 25 organisations -- including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Salesforce and Amazon (NASDAQ: ),"" the findings showed.

Attackers posed as more than 1,000 different organisations in over 1 billion brand impersonation attempts. The majority of the time (51.7 per cent), they impersonated one of 20 well-known brands.

Email authentication also doesn't stop attackers from succeeding as the majority (89 per cent) of unwanted messages passed email authentication methods.

For the report, the team looked at more than 279 million email threat detections, 250 million malicious messages and over 1 billion instances of brand impersonations.

""Phishing is an epidemic that has permeated into the farthest corners of the Internet, preying on trust and victimising everyone from CEOs to government officials to the everyday consumer,"" said Matthew Prince, CEO at Cloudflare.

One-third (30 per cent) of detected threats featured newly registered domains.

While business email compromise (BEC) losses have topped $50 billion, corporate organisations are not the only victims that attackers are after.

The real implications of phishing go beyond Fortune 500's and global companies, extending to small and local organisations as well as the public sector, said the report.

Overall, total broadcast viewing was down 3.6 per cent to finish the month at 20 per cent of TV, representing a new low. On a year-over-year basis, broadcast usage was down 5.4 per cent.

Cable viewing slipped as well, losing a full share point to capture 29.6 per cent of TV in July.

The linear TV now accounts for less than 50 per cent of all TV usage.

""While overall TV usage was up just slightly from June (0.2 per cent), viewing among people under the age of 18 increased 4 per cent, and viewing among adults 18 and older fell 0.3 per cent,"" the report mentioned.

These trends resulted in increased streaming and ""other"" usage, which is primarily attributed to video game consoles.

Comparatively, sports on broadcast generated almost 25 billion viewing minutes in July, albeit across a range of channels in the US.

The arrival of fall will likely result in a seasonal shift in TV viewing, especially with the arrival of a new NFL season.

In November 2022, for example, sports accounted for 150 billion viewing minutes on broadcast.

""The potential for less new original primetime content this fall presents a unique situation for broadcast and cable, but the recent success of acquired programming on streaming channels highlights the outsized strength of quality content, regardless of when it was created,"" said the report.

The massive wave of layoffs has shut down hundreds of thousands of workplaces, turning 2022 into the worst year the tech industry has ever seen, according to data by AltIndex.com.

Between January and December 2022, tech companies laid off 164,744 employees, almost eleven times more than 15,000 reported a year before, as per data from Layoffs.fyi.

A shocking 75,912 people lost their jobs in January alone, almost half of all layoffs reported in 2022.

February saw a decline with roughly 40,000 job cuts. Although the number of layoffs continued falling in the next three months, tech companies still reported almost 73,000 job cuts in this period.

Since then, they have let go nearly 24,000 staff members, pushing the total number of layoffs to 226,117 as of last week, said the report.

Facing an uncertain global economy, inflation, ongoing supply chain issues, and slowing revenue growth, the tech companies picked up the pace of layoffs in 2022, led by giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“But hundreds of other smaller tech companies, from retail and crypto to the transportation market, have also been forced to make painful cost-cutting measures, resulting in the highest number of layoffs the tech industry has ever seen,” the report noted.

The layoff figures for the last three years are even worse. Statistics show that tech companies laid off more than 405,000 people since the beginning of 2021.

US tech giants had a massive role in the 2022 wave of layoffs. In fact, statistics show US companies made eight out of the ten largest job cuts reported this year, the report noted.

2022-08-14, IANS,Tesla to build new '1st of its kind' data centres,https://in.investing.com/news/tesla-to-build-new-1st-of-its-kind-data-centres-3770851,"San Francisco, Aug 14 (IANS) Elon Musk-run Tesla (NASDAQ: ) has said that it will build new ""1st of its kind"" data centres and is hiring staff for it and snapping up some existing data centres.According to Electrek, the majority of the world's largest companies, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure, Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud Platform (GCP), and Meta Platforms (Facebook (NASDAQ: )), are involved.

Now, Tesla is entering the data centre business.

The data centre industry has grown to be massive, with a market value of more than $250 billion.

According to the report, the automaker has shared a new job posting for a ""Sr Engineering Program Manager, Data Centre"" role, in which the company said that it will build ""1st of its kind Data Centres"".

""This role will lead the end-to-end design and engineering of Tesla's 1st

of its kind Data Centres and will be one of the key members of the factory

engineering team,"" the job post reads.

Tesla didn't say how those data centres will be ""first of their kind"", which isn't something you'd expect to see in a job posting.

However, the new initiative coincides with Tesla's acquisition of Twitter's data

centres, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Cybertruck has been spotted with a wrap that makes it look like a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

Cybertruck was seen being transported on a truck in Livermore, California.

On prototype cars, Tesla rarely used camouflage or wraps, but lately, the

Cybertruck has been seen more frequently with wraps

Some people believe that the auto-maker is wrapping the Cybertruck prototypes to hide the final production design, while others speculate that

the company is testing wraps since it is going to be the only way to make the vehicle look different.

2022-08-12, Investing.com,This week in tech: Alibaba's rosy quarter; PayPal's stablecoin; a plunge at Roblox,https://in.investing.com/news/this-week-in-tech-alibabas-rosy-quarter-paypals-stablecoin-a-plunge-at-roblox-3769394,"By Louis Juricic and Sarina Isaacs

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: earnings out of Alibaba, Lyft , Roblox, and Twilio, and a big announcement from PayPal.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Alibaba's 'all-around clean quarter'

Alibaba (NYSE: ) shares climbed Thursday after the China-based e-commerce giant posted adjusted core income Thursday that topped analyst estimates, boosted by strong consumer spending during a major shopping event in China in June.

Recent economic data, including numbers earlier this week showing a contraction in consumer prices, have sparked concerns over a sluggish post-pandemic recovery in China, the world's second-largest economy.

But combined revenues at Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall retail platforms still grew by 12% in the June quarter to 114.95B yuan (1 yuan = $0.1387), fueled by increased purchasing activity during the 618 shopping festival.

Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud division rose to 25.12B yuan thanks in part to demand for its artificial intelligence computing products, in the latest sign of surging interest in the nascent technology.

DZ Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold on this news, and Benchmark - which also calls the stock a buy - called the print an ""all-around clean quarter.""

Benchmark added that Alibaba’s new “consumer-centric approach has started bearing early fruit” as the company undergoes “a fundamental turnaround,"" and said it believes ""a sustainable higher margin profile warrants earnings upward revision and a rerating on the stock"" as multiple strategic assets ""are back on a high-growth trajectory.""

Benchmark's price target on BABA is $180.

U.S.-listed shares closed up 4.6% Thursday, but stepped back 2.1% for the week to $95.72.

PayPal breaks new ground with stablecoin launch

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) has become the first large financial services company to launch its own stablecoin, as the group looks to fuel the adoption of digital tokens for payments.

The stablecoin - a type of crypto token pegged to an asset like the dollar - will be known as PayPal USD and backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, PayPal announced Monday. Paxos Trust Company will issue PayPal USD.

Eligible customers in the U.S. will now be able to purchase PayPal USD to make transfers between PayPal and external wallets, send person-to-person payments, and fund purchases.

The move comes as PayPal, which has been impacted by an easing in online spending after the pandemic, attempts to boost the digital payment options available to customers. Shares are down 40% over the past year - including a 16% slide last week on gross profit concerns after its - although the stock perked up by 2.7% Monday on the stablecoin news.

The stock retreated 2.4% for the week to $61.54.

Lyft shares take a wild ride after earnings

LYFT (NASDAQ: ) shares seesawed last week on earnings and management commentary, ultimately finishing the week higher.

The company said on Wednesday that adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.16, beating expectations for a $0.01 loss, and revenue of $1.02 billion met the consensus figure. It also sees Q3 revenue of $1.13B to $1.15B, higher than Wall Street estimates.

While shares rose initially on Wednesday, they quickly fell during the session on cautious management commentary.

Bernstein analysts said the results show that headwinds facing Lyft's business will continue to persist through the rest of the year, but added, ""We appreciate management getting out ahead of the tough Q4 set-up and offering some rough guidance.""

Bernstein said investors can now focus on 2024, which it believes should see a reacceleration in revenue, but said: ""the underlying earnings power and FCF generation of the model remain outstanding questions.""

Susquehanna said management commentary led ""to another noisy report,"" noting that its ""competitive pricing initiative will continue to weigh on the unit economics, and the upcoming insurance renewals could add some noise on the cost side later in the year.""

After its 10% slide Wednesday, however, shares more than erased that loss in the next session after the company said in a blog post that it will start displaying advertisements on its app as it looks to create a more stable source of revenue.

The move should help Lyft, whose business is completely dependent on ride-hailing, and it should also boost CEO David Risher's turnaround plans.

Lyft said it has partnered with adtech company, Rokt, to sell ads, and that its advertising partners include Bilt Rewards, Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) Audible, and Comcast's (NASDAQ: ) Universal Pictures.

Shares closed the week up 4.9% to $11.38.

Roblox plummets on soft earnings, then picks up a couple upgrades

Roblox (NYSE: ) shares were in free fall Wednesday after the company reported a of $0.46 per share, $0.02 worse than the expectations.

At the same time, the key metric of bookings came in at $780.7 million versus the $785.4M consensus, and the platform saw Average Daily Active Users (DAUs) rise 25% to 65.5 million.

Shares fell 22% on the news Wednesday - a sell-off that triggered upgrades at both Morgan Stanley and Wedbush.

Morgan Stanley upped the stock to Equal Weight given what they see as a more balanced risk-reward from current levels.

And Wedbush upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37, arguing that Roblox “may have the most compelling growth trajectory among the video game names in our coverage universe after taking into account its user base size, its new products, and the potential to revisit its approach to profits.”

“The risk/reward profile has become favorable to the upside,” the analyst said in a note to clients.

Shares gained nearly 4% Thursday after the upgrades, but were still down by over 20% for the week to $29.82.

Twilio comes in well ahead of targets

Twilio (NYSE: ) recorded Q2 EPS of $0.54, far better than the consensus target of $0.30, and 10% vs. a year earlier to a better-than-expected $1.04 billion.

Communications revenue was $913.1M, up 10% year-over-year, while Data & Applications revenue came in at $124.6M, representing a 12% year-over-year increase.

For Q3, the company expects EPS in the range of $0.33-$0.37, comfortably above the $0.30 consensus, although it also sees revenue at $998B to $99B, lower than the $1.02B average analyst estimate.

Following these results, Argus upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $72, and Barclays hiked the company's price target by $10 to $60 per share.

""Messaging volume stabilization supports stronger revenue beat and improving FY24 outlook, but we would like to see more contribution from the Data & Applications segment,"" Bernstein analysts said.

Bernstein said that, on an adjusted basis, the guidance is ""the highest quarterly revenue guide they've ever had.""

Shares were up 2.2% Wednesday and advanced 1% for the week overall, closing Friday at $61.94.

Here is your Pro Recap of 4 head-turning deal dispatches you may have missed this week: Deals at Capri-Tapestry, Decibel-Regeneron, Amazon in talks to potentially anchor Arm's IPO, and Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group reaffirm commitment to the merger.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tapestry agrees to buy Michael Kors parent Capri for $8.5 billion

Capri (NYSE: ) shares rocketed more than 55% on Thursday after Tapestry (NYSE: ) said it agreed to buy Capri, the parent company of Michael Kors, for $57 per share in cash, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

The deal is valued at roughly $8.5 billion.

The companies anticipate achieving cost synergies exceeding $200 million within three years of finalizing the transaction. Together, the businesses generated global annual sales of $12B and nearly $2B in adjusted operating profit in the prior fiscal year.

Tapestry shares dropped nearly 16% on Thursday following the announcement.

Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group reaffirm commitment to the merger

Special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ: ) and Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the latter of which operates the Truth Social platform, reaffirmed their commitment to merge after Wednesday's market close, unveiling an amendment to their October 2022 merger agreement, according to which TMTG will go public via a $1.7B SPAC deal with DWAC.

This development comes after DWAC revealed that it had received an email from Truth Network regarding a specific section of the agreement. DWAC's interpretation of this was that by obtaining shareholder approval to extend the liquidation timeline by three months - until September 8, 2024 - it can similarly prolong the agreement's ""Outside Date"" for that same duration. In contrast, Truth Network asserted that its obligations are only binding until September 8, 2022.

The amended agreement extends the merger’s “Outside Date” to December 31 of this year, with shared due diligence ahead of submitting updated filings to the SEC.

DWAC shares jumped more than 11% in Thursday's session.

Amazon in talks to potentially anchor Arm's IPO

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is currently engaged in discussions regarding the possibility of becoming an investor alongside other tech firms in SoftBank Group's (TYO: ) Arm before its initial public offering, according to a Reuters report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

This potential participation by Amazon in the IPO highlights the significant role Arm plays in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud division, develops its own processing chip named Graviton, utilizing Arm's design.

One of the sources mentioned that Arm is aiming to debut on the by early September, intending to raise an estimated $8B to $10B. Both Arm and Amazon declined to comment on the matter.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to take out Decibel

Decibel Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped around 80% on Wednesday on word that it will be acquired by Regeneron Pharma (NASDAQ: ) at $4 per share, payable in cash at closing, with an additional non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR).

The CVR allows shareholders to receive an additional $3.50 per share in cash, contingent upon the successful accomplishment of specific clinical development and regulatory goals for Decibel's main investigational product, DB-OTO, which is being developed for the treatment of congenital, profound deafness resulting from otoferlin (OTOF) deficiency in pediatric patients.

The proposed acquisition values Decibel at a total equity value of approximately $109M based on the amount payable at closing, and a total equity value of up to approximately $213M if the CVR milestones are achieved.

In an Instagram post late on Friday, Sanchez wrote that they ""are creating a Maui Fund and are dedicating $100 million to help Maui get back on its feet now and over the coming years as the continuing needs reveal themselves"".

""Jeff and I are heartbroken by what's happening in Maui. We are thinking of all the families that have lost so much and a community that has been left devastated.

The immediate needs are important, and so is the longer term rebuilding that will have to happen - even after much of the attention has subsided,"" she added.

According to earlier reports, Bezos purchased a 14-acre estate on La Perouse Bay for an estimated $78 million last year. The bay is less than 20 miles south of fires in South Maui.

In May, Bezos, 59, and Sanchez, 53, got engaged and threw engagement parties. They started dating in 2018 and reportedly went public with their relationship after the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) billionaire divorced his first wife MacKenzie Scott in 2019.

Meanwhile, West Maui, where Lahaina is located, is still without power and water. Search crews are still in the area looking for wildfire victims.

More than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed in Lahaina, a coastal town with a rich history that attracts some two million tourists a year.

Wildfires on Hawaii's Maui island and Big Island began on Tuesday night. The cause is still not known but once lit, hurricane winds and dry weather helped fuel the flames.

""Attackers primarily impersonate the brands and entities we trust and rely on. In the majority (60.1 per cent) of cases, attackers pose as one just 25 organisations -- including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Salesforce and Amazon (NASDAQ: ),"" the findings showed.

Attackers posed as more than 1,000 different organisations in over 1 billion brand impersonation attempts. The majority of the time (51.7 per cent), they impersonated one of 20 well-known brands.

Email authentication also doesn't stop attackers from succeeding as the majority (89 per cent) of unwanted messages passed email authentication methods.

For the report, the team looked at more than 279 million email threat detections, 250 million malicious messages and over 1 billion instances of brand impersonations.

""Phishing is an epidemic that has permeated into the farthest corners of the Internet, preying on trust and victimising everyone from CEOs to government officials to the everyday consumer,"" said Matthew Prince, CEO at Cloudflare.

One-third (30 per cent) of detected threats featured newly registered domains.

While business email compromise (BEC) losses have topped $50 billion, corporate organisations are not the only victims that attackers are after.

The real implications of phishing go beyond Fortune 500's and global companies, extending to small and local organisations as well as the public sector, said the report.

2022-08-16, IANS,Streaming grabs record 38.7% of total TV usage in US,https://in.investing.com/news/streaming-grabs-record-387-of-total-tv-usage-in-us-3772791,"San Francisco, Aug 16 (IANS) Modern OTT platforms have won the war against traditional TV as streaming grabbed a record 38.7 per cent of total TV usage in July, with acquired titles outpacing new originals in the US, a new report has revealed.In aggregate, the heavy viewing levels pushed streaming's share of TV to 38.7 per cent, a new record, with Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and YouTube all hitting all-time highs, according to data from Nielsen.

Overall, total broadcast viewing was down 3.6 per cent to finish the month at 20 per cent of TV, representing a new low. On a year-over-year basis, broadcast usage was down 5.4 per cent.

Cable viewing slipped as well, losing a full share point to capture 29.6 per cent of TV in July.

The linear TV now accounts for less than 50 per cent of all TV usage.

""While overall TV usage was up just slightly from June (0.2 per cent), viewing among people under the age of 18 increased 4 per cent, and viewing among adults 18 and older fell 0.3 per cent,"" the report mentioned.

These trends resulted in increased streaming and ""other"" usage, which is primarily attributed to video game consoles.

Comparatively, sports on broadcast generated almost 25 billion viewing minutes in July, albeit across a range of channels in the US.

The arrival of fall will likely result in a seasonal shift in TV viewing, especially with the arrival of a new NFL season.

In November 2022, for example, sports accounted for 150 billion viewing minutes on broadcast.

""The potential for less new original primetime content this fall presents a unique situation for broadcast and cable, but the recent success of acquired programming on streaming channels highlights the outsized strength of quality content, regardless of when it was created,"" said the report.

2022-08-15, IANS,"Tech companies laid off 226,000 employees to date, 40% more than in 2022",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-companies-laid-off-226000-employees-to-date-40-more-than-in-2022-3771632,"New Delhi, Aug 15 (IANS) Tech companies have laid off 226,000 employees so far this year, almost 40 per cent more than in 2022, a report showed on Tuesday.Although the tech industry has seen a shocking number of job cuts last year, 2022 has been much worse.

The massive wave of layoffs has shut down hundreds of thousands of workplaces, turning 2022 into the worst year the tech industry has ever seen, according to data by AltIndex.com.

Between January and December 2022, tech companies laid off 164,744 employees, almost eleven times more than 15,000 reported a year before, as per data from Layoffs.fyi.

A shocking 75,912 people lost their jobs in January alone, almost half of all layoffs reported in 2022.

February saw a decline with roughly 40,000 job cuts. Although the number of layoffs continued falling in the next three months, tech companies still reported almost 73,000 job cuts in this period.

Since then, they have let go nearly 24,000 staff members, pushing the total number of layoffs to 226,117 as of last week, said the report.

Facing an uncertain global economy, inflation, ongoing supply chain issues, and slowing revenue growth, the tech companies picked up the pace of layoffs in 2022, led by giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“But hundreds of other smaller tech companies, from retail and crypto to the transportation market, have also been forced to make painful cost-cutting measures, resulting in the highest number of layoffs the tech industry has ever seen,” the report noted.

The layoff figures for the last three years are even worse. Statistics show that tech companies laid off more than 405,000 people since the beginning of 2021.

US tech giants had a massive role in the 2022 wave of layoffs. In fact, statistics show US companies made eight out of the ten largest job cuts reported this year, the report noted.

Now, Tesla is entering the data centre business.

The data centre industry has grown to be massive, with a market value of more than $250 billion.

According to the report, the automaker has shared a new job posting for a ""Sr Engineering Program Manager, Data Centre"" role, in which the company said that it will build ""1st of its kind Data Centres"".

""This role will lead the end-to-end design and engineering of Tesla's 1st

of its kind Data Centres and will be one of the key members of the factory

engineering team,"" the job post reads.

Tesla didn't say how those data centres will be ""first of their kind"", which isn't something you'd expect to see in a job posting.

However, the new initiative coincides with Tesla's acquisition of Twitter's data

centres, the report mentioned.

Meanwhile, Tesla's Cybertruck has been spotted with a wrap that makes it look like a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

Cybertruck was seen being transported on a truck in Livermore, California.

On prototype cars, Tesla rarely used camouflage or wraps, but lately, the

Cybertruck has been seen more frequently with wraps

Some people believe that the auto-maker is wrapping the Cybertruck prototypes to hide the final production design, while others speculate that

the company is testing wraps since it is going to be the only way to make the vehicle look different.

2022-08-12, Investing.com,This week in tech: Alibaba's rosy quarter; PayPal's stablecoin; a plunge at Roblox,https://in.investing.com/news/this-week-in-tech-alibabas-rosy-quarter-paypals-stablecoin-a-plunge-at-roblox-3769394,"By Louis Juricic and Sarina Isaacs

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: earnings out of Alibaba, Lyft , Roblox, and Twilio, and a big announcement from PayPal.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Alibaba's 'all-around clean quarter'

Alibaba (NYSE: ) shares climbed Thursday after the China-based e-commerce giant posted adjusted core income Thursday that topped analyst estimates, boosted by strong consumer spending during a major shopping event in China in June.

Recent economic data, including numbers earlier this week showing a contraction in consumer prices, have sparked concerns over a sluggish post-pandemic recovery in China, the world's second-largest economy.

But combined revenues at Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall retail platforms still grew by 12% in the June quarter to 114.95B yuan (1 yuan = $0.1387), fueled by increased purchasing activity during the 618 shopping festival.

Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud division rose to 25.12B yuan thanks in part to demand for its artificial intelligence computing products, in the latest sign of surging interest in the nascent technology.

DZ Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold on this news, and Benchmark - which also calls the stock a buy - called the print an ""all-around clean quarter.""

Benchmark added that Alibaba’s new “consumer-centric approach has started bearing early fruit” as the company undergoes “a fundamental turnaround,"" and said it believes ""a sustainable higher margin profile warrants earnings upward revision and a rerating on the stock"" as multiple strategic assets ""are back on a high-growth trajectory.""

Benchmark's price target on BABA is $180.

U.S.-listed shares closed up 4.6% Thursday, but stepped back 2.1% for the week to $95.72.

PayPal breaks new ground with stablecoin launch

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) has become the first large financial services company to launch its own stablecoin, as the group looks to fuel the adoption of digital tokens for payments.

The stablecoin - a type of crypto token pegged to an asset like the dollar - will be known as PayPal USD and backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents, PayPal announced Monday. Paxos Trust Company will issue PayPal USD.

Eligible customers in the U.S. will now be able to purchase PayPal USD to make transfers between PayPal and external wallets, send person-to-person payments, and fund purchases.

The move comes as PayPal, which has been impacted by an easing in online spending after the pandemic, attempts to boost the digital payment options available to customers. Shares are down 40% over the past year - including a 16% slide last week on gross profit concerns after its - although the stock perked up by 2.7% Monday on the stablecoin news.

The stock retreated 2.4% for the week to $61.54.

Lyft shares take a wild ride after earnings

LYFT (NASDAQ: ) shares seesawed last week on earnings and management commentary, ultimately finishing the week higher.

The company said on Wednesday that adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.16, beating expectations for a $0.01 loss, and revenue of $1.02 billion met the consensus figure. It also sees Q3 revenue of $1.13B to $1.15B, higher than Wall Street estimates.

While shares rose initially on Wednesday, they quickly fell during the session on cautious management commentary.

Bernstein analysts said the results show that headwinds facing Lyft's business will continue to persist through the rest of the year, but added, ""We appreciate management getting out ahead of the tough Q4 set-up and offering some rough guidance.""

Bernstein said investors can now focus on 2024, which it believes should see a reacceleration in revenue, but said: ""the underlying earnings power and FCF generation of the model remain outstanding questions.""

Susquehanna said management commentary led ""to another noisy report,"" noting that its ""competitive pricing initiative will continue to weigh on the unit economics, and the upcoming insurance renewals could add some noise on the cost side later in the year.""

After its 10% slide Wednesday, however, shares more than erased that loss in the next session after the company said in a blog post that it will start displaying advertisements on its app as it looks to create a more stable source of revenue.

The move should help Lyft, whose business is completely dependent on ride-hailing, and it should also boost CEO David Risher's turnaround plans.

Lyft said it has partnered with adtech company, Rokt, to sell ads, and that its advertising partners include Bilt Rewards, Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) Audible, and Comcast's (NASDAQ: ) Universal Pictures.

Shares closed the week up 4.9% to $11.38.

Roblox plummets on soft earnings, then picks up a couple upgrades

Roblox (NYSE: ) shares were in free fall Wednesday after the company reported a of $0.46 per share, $0.02 worse than the expectations.

At the same time, the key metric of bookings came in at $780.7 million versus the $785.4M consensus, and the platform saw Average Daily Active Users (DAUs) rise 25% to 65.5 million.

Shares fell 22% on the news Wednesday - a sell-off that triggered upgrades at both Morgan Stanley and Wedbush.

Morgan Stanley upped the stock to Equal Weight given what they see as a more balanced risk-reward from current levels.

And Wedbush upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37, arguing that Roblox “may have the most compelling growth trajectory among the video game names in our coverage universe after taking into account its user base size, its new products, and the potential to revisit its approach to profits.”

“The risk/reward profile has become favorable to the upside,” the analyst said in a note to clients.

Shares gained nearly 4% Thursday after the upgrades, but were still down by over 20% for the week to $29.82.

Twilio comes in well ahead of targets

Twilio (NYSE: ) recorded Q2 EPS of $0.54, far better than the consensus target of $0.30, and 10% vs. a year earlier to a better-than-expected $1.04 billion.

Communications revenue was $913.1M, up 10% year-over-year, while Data & Applications revenue came in at $124.6M, representing a 12% year-over-year increase.

For Q3, the company expects EPS in the range of $0.33-$0.37, comfortably above the $0.30 consensus, although it also sees revenue at $998B to $99B, lower than the $1.02B average analyst estimate.

Following these results, Argus upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $72, and Barclays hiked the company's price target by $10 to $60 per share.

""Messaging volume stabilization supports stronger revenue beat and improving FY24 outlook, but we would like to see more contribution from the Data & Applications segment,"" Bernstein analysts said.

Bernstein said that, on an adjusted basis, the guidance is ""the highest quarterly revenue guide they've ever had.""

Shares were up 2.2% Wednesday and advanced 1% for the week overall, closing Friday at $61.94.

Here is your Pro Recap of 4 head-turning deal dispatches you may have missed this week: Deals at Capri-Tapestry, Decibel-Regeneron, Amazon in talks to potentially anchor Arm's IPO, and Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group reaffirm commitment to the merger.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tapestry agrees to buy Michael Kors parent Capri for $8.5 billion

Capri (NYSE: ) shares rocketed more than 55% on Thursday after Tapestry (NYSE: ) said it agreed to buy Capri, the parent company of Michael Kors, for $57 per share in cash, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

Tapestry shares dropped nearly 16% on Thursday following the announcement.

Digital World Acquisition and Trump Media & Technology Group reaffirm commitment to the merger

Special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition (NASDAQ: ) and Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the latter of which operates the Truth Social platform, reaffirmed their commitment to merge after Wednesday's market close, unveiling an amendment to their October 2022 merger agreement, according to which TMTG will go public via a $1.7B SPAC deal with DWAC.

This development comes after DWAC revealed that it had received an email from Truth Network regarding a specific section of the agreement. DWAC's interpretation of this was that by obtaining shareholder approval to extend the liquidation timeline by three months - until September 8, 2024 - it can similarly prolong the agreement's ""Outside Date"" for that same duration. In contrast, Truth Network asserted that its obligations are only binding until September 8, 2022.

The amended agreement extends the merger’s “Outside Date” to December 31 of this year, with shared due diligence ahead of submitting updated filings to the SEC.

DWAC shares jumped more than 11% in Thursday's session.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is currently engaged in discussions regarding the possibility of becoming an investor alongside other tech firms in SoftBank Group's (TYO: ) Arm before its initial public offering, according to a Reuters report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

This potential participation by Amazon in the IPO highlights the significant role Arm plays in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud division, develops its own processing chip named Graviton, utilizing Arm's design.

One of the sources mentioned that Arm is aiming to debut on the by early September, intending to raise an estimated $8B to $10B. Both Arm and Amazon declined to comment on the matter.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to take out Decibel

Decibel Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped around 80% on Wednesday on word that it will be acquired by Regeneron Pharma (NASDAQ: ) at $4 per share, payable in cash at closing, with an additional non-tradeable contingent value right (CVR).

The proposed acquisition values Decibel at a total equity value of approximately $109M based on the amount payable at closing, and a total equity value of up to approximately $213M if the CVR milestones are achieved.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon has created dozens of private-label brands across a variety of departments over the years, the majority of which operate without Amazon branding, such as Solimo, Wag, and Mama Bear.

However, with this reduction, the tech giant will only have three in-house clothing brands -- Amazon Essentials, Amazon Collection, and Amazon Aware.

2022-08-11, IANS,"Innovations, strategy drive realme's exceptional 51% Q2 growth in India",https://in.investing.com/news/innovations-strategy-drive-realmes-exceptional-51-q2-growth-in-india-3767848,"New Delhi, Aug 11 (IANS) The Indian smartphone market has developed into a fiercely competitive arena, marked by technological leaps and consumer preferences shifting at a rapid pace. The competition has driven the industry to new heights, with each player aiming to capture the attention of the diverse Indian consumer base.In the face of fierce competition, realme stands out for its steadfast strategy for introducing ground-breaking technologies to the market. Recognizing the need to differentiate itself, realme has managed to carve a niche for its products that resonates with consumers seeking both price-friendliness and advanced features.

According to Counterpoint Research, realme saw an incredible 51 per cent quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in Q2 2022.IDC's rankings place realme at No. 3 among the top 10 smartphone brands in India, despite a 3 per cent year-over-year fall in the total smartphone market during the same period. Strategic positioning, ground-breaking innovations, and a focus on 5G devices in the Rs 10,000–Rs 15,000 ($122–$244) pricing range all contributed to this growth.

realme's remarkable success can be attributed to a constellation of key factors that underscore its ascent in the market. One pivotal element is their astute approach to inventory and demand management, ensuring a finely tuned supply chain.

Complemented by this, their bold and strategic sales promotions have played a significant role in propelling the brand's prominence. Moreover, realme's shrewd decision to make 5G devices accessible at compelling price points has also been pivotal in their triumph.

Marking a significant stride in innovation during the first half of 2022, realme said it has unveiled groundbreaking products that have captured the imagination of consumers.

realme launched the 10 Pro Coca Cola limited edition smartphone, created for a breath of fresh air to the yet another design-forward smartphone by realme. With a Dynamic Island-inspired Mini Capsule, realme launched the C55 smartphone raising the bar of leap forward smartphones in the Indian market.

This year, realme won numerous achievements across a range of devices that have emerged as bestsellers in their respective categories like the 11 Pro Series which broke the highest first-sale record in its segment by selling 200K+ devices across all channels, and the best-selling narzo N53 broke records by selling 100K units in just 90 minutes, emerging as the Number 1 best-selling smartphone under the Rs. 10K segment on Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

realme's market penetration has been skillfully handled through a dual-channel strategy combining online and physical channels. Collaborative partnerships with esteemed platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart have significantly bolstered their market presence.

The brand's adaptability in managing inventory has been particularly noteworthy. This agility is underscored by a series of carefully orchestrated strategies, said the company.

A well-structured product lifecycle plan has been employed, meticulously divided into distinct phases - the hot sales period, sustenance phase, and end-of-life phase. Each phase is accompanied by a judicious channel strategy, informed by invaluable feedback from channel partners.

According to the company, a critical component of their success has been the unwavering support provided to products over time. This strategy makes sure that products move smoothly throughout the retail environment, expanding their market reach.

“realme's approach to launching the next generation of phones is marked by a well-calibrated gap, allowing ample time for each iteration to flourish before the introduction of its successor,” it added.

A strong relationship between the brand and retailers is supported by regular updates on product strategy. This collaborative relationship empowers retailers to liquidate their inventory in a timely manner.

realme's meticulous oversight extends to a granular level of sales and supply management at the retail level. This approach ensures a seamless flow of products within the retail ecosystem, further enhancing their market reach, it said.

Central to realme's growth is its ""Spire Strategy,"" which prioritizes groundbreaking innovations in performance, design, and user experience. The strategy is bolstered by the ""Simple Better Strategy,"" emphasizing comprehensive innovations across product lines. With a dedicated focus on four core product lines – GT Series, Number Series, C Series, narzo Series – as well as a strategic emphasis on mid-premium devices, realme is able to meet a wide spectrum of customer demands.

Now in its fifth year of business, realme said it is still committed to offering all-encompassing experiences. The brand is getting closer to achieving its aim of being one of the top five smartphone brands globally because of its dedication to developing innovative products and encouraging user involvement.

In organic terms, it grew by 3.8 %.

The company raised its 2022 operating profit target a second time, now expecting EBITDA AL of approximately €41.0B (vs. prior €40.9B), which would represent a 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate stood at €40.4B. The guidance increase is driven by the Group ex-T-Mobile (new EBITDA AL target of €14.0B, vs. old target of €13.9B), even if T-Mobile U.S. Inc (NASDAQ: ) did also increase its adjusted Core EBITDA outlook with its recent Q2 earnings announcement.

Group FCF guidance remained unchanged at >€16B, implying a 40% year-over-year growth.

“We continued our successful course in the second quarter. Our businesses are developing well, despite complex market environments. This is underscored by our organic growth rates for service revenues, earnings, and free cash flow,” said CEO Tim Höttges.

Following the announcement, UBS reiterated its Buy rating and a €25.70 price target on the company, noting they believe the 12% decline in share price over the past 3 months is overdone and is primarily driven by concerns about Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) potential offer of a free or heavily discounted mobile service to its U.S.-based Amazon Prime members.

“While U.S. investors have shrugged off the impact given the recovery in the TMUS share price, this has not been reflected in DT shares despite recent clarity on the issue, which we see as an anomaly. We see the recent 1&1/Vodafone NRA deal as neutral for DT with a limited impact in the near- term, but there may be question about competitive dynamics in the German market medium-term,” mentioned UBS."

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Amazon earns another upgrade following Q2 beat

PhillipCapital upgraded Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $175.00 from $120.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

Amazon expects the trend of customers shifting their focus towards innovation and new workload deployments to continue into Q3/23 and anticipates the optimization efforts to ease further, suggesting that growth has bottomed out. According to PhillipCapital, there's a possibility for a renewed re-acceleration in the latter half of 2022, especially during Q4. This perspective is based on Amazon's launch of its new AI services and the gradual uptick in customer spending on AWS.

Earlier this month, the company saw upgrades from two other Wall Street firms, Exane BNP Paribas and Rosenblatt.

The rating changes were made following the company's , which exceeded Street estimates and included upbeat Q3 guidance, driven by the cloud business growth that surpassed expectations.

Roblox earns two upgrades following disappointing Q2

Roblox (NYSE: ) shares rose more than 2% premarket today after receiving upgrades from two Wall Street firms.

Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Equalweight from Underweight and raised its price target to $30.00 from $26.00.

While 2Q results were mixed, we believe that shares now fairly reflect the near term headwinds (e.g. 2H:23 bookings deceleration), balanced against the longer term opportunities to drive growth and operating leverage (e.g. AI tools and ads).

Meanwhile, Wedbush upgraded the company to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37.00.

The company fell short of on Wednesday due to declining demand for its online games and increased competition. This resulted in more than a 22% drop in share price, wiping out almost all the gains made this year.

Marqeta upgraded following Q2 earnings and the Cash App deal

Berenberg upgraded Marqeta (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $8.00 from $5.00 following the company’s and the announcement of a four-year extension of its contract with Block (NYSE: ) to power its Cash App.

According to Berenberg, this has eliminated a significant uncertainty surrounding the company's shares.

While MQ’s near-term operating performance will reflect the economics of the Cash App renewal, which were (predictably) much reduced from what they had been in the prior deal given Block’s strong bargaining position, the company will now be able to establish a new baseline from which to grow during the next few years.

Shares closed with more than 11% gain yesterday following the announcements.

Kornit Digital upgraded at Morgan Stanley after a Q2 miss

Kornit Digital (NASDAQ: ) shares gained more than 3% premarket today after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Overweight from Equalweight with a price target of $29.00.

Shares plunged more than 20% yesterday after the company’s Q2 revenues came in worse than expected.

According to Morgan Stanley, this reaction is overblown given a strong post-ITMA systems and upgrade pipeline that should return the company to revenue growth and EBITDA profitability in 2024.

Elsewhere, Disney gears up to unveil its latest results as its ESPN division signs a partnership with gambler Penn Entertainment. Meanwhile, inflation in China contracts in July, further exacerbating concerns over the country's post-COVID recovery.

1. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Wednesday, hinting at a rebound from declines in the prior session that were sparked by a downgrade of several regional banks by Moody's.

By 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT), the contract added 91 points or 0.26%, rose by 17 points or 0.37%, and gained 65 points or 0.42%.

The three major indices on Wall Street slipped on Tuesday, dragged down in particular by bank shares after Moody's slashed its rating of 10 midsized lenders. The ratings agency highlighted concerns over sluggish deposits, elevated funding costs and risks to commercial real estate assets.

The move fanned renewed fears over the health of the U.S. banking sector, which is attempting to regain its footing following the failure of three regional lenders earlier this year. Moody's also placed six banks on review, suggesting that further downgrades could also be coming.

2. Amazon in talks to become anchor investor in Arm prior to IPO - Reuters

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is in negotiations over joining a number of other technology firms as an anchor investor in Softbank-owned chip designer Arm's planned initial public offering, according to a Reuters report that cited people familiar with the situation.

The e-commerce giant would be one of about 10 tech sector players who are reportedly eyeing a cornerstone stake in Britain-based Arm, including semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Arm hopes to list on the in September, a source told Reuters, with the company aiming to raise between $8 billion to $10 billion.

For Amazon, the investment in Arm would also highlight its increasing focus on cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud unit, uses Arm's design to produce a processing chip called Graviton.

Both Amazon and Arm declined to comment, Reuters said.

3. Disney on deck

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to headline the earnings calendar Wednesday, with the media conglomerate expected to face tough questions over recent box office busts and its sputtering television business.

This summer, ""Haunted Mansion,"" Disney's latest push to create a movie franchise out of a famous ride at its theme parks, has delivered disappointing ticket sales. ""Elemental,"" a new release from Disney's animation powerhouse Pixar, also debuted in June to a poor opening weekend.

Disney's TV division, which once financed high-profile mergers, has struggled to entice lucrative advertisers. Its streaming unit, meanwhile, is not projected to make a profit until next year.

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who returned to the role in November, has been musing publicly about potential strategic initiatives that could help reinvigorate returns. Investors, who have seen Disney's stock fall by around a fifth over the past one-year period, will likely be keen to ask Iger for more details about these plans.

4. ESPN inks sportsbook partnership with Penn Entertainment

Iger's push to revitalize flagging segments of Disney was perhaps illustrated on Tuesday, when its ESPN sports network signed a $2 billion deal with casino owner and online gambler Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: ).

Under the terms of the agreement, Penn will rebrand its U.S. sports betting portals, currently known as Barstool Sportsbook, as ESPN Bet. Penn will pay ESPN $1.5B in cash over a 10-year term and grant $500 million in warrants for its stock. ESPN Bet will launch this fall in 16 legalized betting states.

The partnership will give ESPN an extra revenue source and access to the increasingly lucrative U.S. sports gambling sector, which has been growing in popularity since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018.

It also marks a change of heart from Iger, who had previously veered away from tying together a family-friendly brand like Disney with the gambling industry. He said in an interview with Time magazine in April that the ""acceptance of sports betting has grown significantly.""

5. Chinese consumer inflation shrinks

Chinese consumer inflation shrank last month, indicating that weak local liquidity and spending are weighing down the world's second-largest economy.

The (CPI) fell 0.3% in the 12 months to July, although the number was slightly better than expectations for a drop of 0.4%, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. This came after a flat reading for June, and marks the first annual contraction in CPI since September 2021.

The inflation print comes after recent figures pointed to a deterioration in Chinese and as well as flagging growth in Chinese business activity.

A joint statement on Tuesday, named the Belem declaration, created a new alliance to combat deforestation, but left each country to pursue its own conservation goals.

It also said the new alliance would aim to ""prevent the Amazon from reaching a point of no return"".

The statement also included commitments to enhance co-operation on issues like water management, health, sustainable development and common negotiating positions at global climate summits.

Addressing the ""severe worsening of the climate crisis"" in his opening speech at the summit on Tuesday, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said ""the challenges of our era, and the opportunities arising from them, demand we act in unison"".

""It has never been so urgent,"" the BBC quoted the President as saying.

Differences in opinion however, was witnessed at the summit.

While Colombian President Gustavo Petro wants other countries to match his pledge to ban new oil exploration, Brazil is considering exploring new areas at the mouth of the Amazon river.

The summit came less than a week after it was revealed that the level of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has dropped to its lowest since 2017.

According to the data shared by the Brazilian space agency Inpe on Aug 3, 500 sq km of rainforest were cleared the country last month which was 66 per cent less compared to July 2022, reports the BBC.

Inpe said that the area of forest cut down in the first seven months of 2022 was smaller than that razed in the same period in 2022.

When President Lula took office in January, he had promised to halt the damage done during his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term.

Bolsonaro had promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon and forest clearances soared at the same time as resources to protect the forest were cut.

Preserving the Amazon is a central part of efforts to tackle climate change.

The rainforest is a crucial buffer in the global fight against climate change and 60 per cent of it is located in Brazil.

The billions of trees that make up the Amazon, often called ""the lungs of the planet"", hold vast amounts of carbon, accumulated over centuries, and every year their leaves continue to absorb carbon dioxide that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere and contribute to the rise in global temperatures.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon has created dozens of private-label brands across a variety of departments over the years, the majority of which operate without Amazon branding, such as Solimo, Wag, and Mama Bear.

However, with this reduction, the tech giant will only have three in-house clothing brands -- Amazon Essentials, Amazon Collection, and Amazon Aware.

""We always make decisions based on what our customers want, and we’ve learned that customers seek out our biggest brands -- like Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials -- for great value with high-quality products at great price points,"" Matt Taddy, vice president of Amazon Private Brands, was quoted as saying.

The company is also ditching some private-label furniture brands, including Rivet and Stone & Beam.

According to the report, Amazon will continue to sell products from the now-discontinued brands until they run out.

The tech giant had 2,43,000 products for sale from over 45 different private-label brands as of 2020.

Amazon's decision to streamline its private label business coincides with the possibility of a US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) antitrust lawsuit, the report said.

Meanwhile, Amazon has posted strong financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, with net sales increasing 11 per cent to $134.4 billion and net income at $6.7 billion, compared with a net loss of $2 billion in the year-ago quarter.

The competition has driven the industry to new heights, with each player aiming to capture the attention of the diverse Indian consumer base.In the face of fierce competition, realme stands out for its steadfast strategy for introducing ground-breaking technologies to the market. Recognizing the need to differentiate itself, realme has managed to carve a niche for its products that resonates with consumers seeking both price-friendliness and advanced features.

According to Counterpoint Research, realme saw an incredible 51 per cent quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in Q2 2022.IDC's rankings place realme at No. 3 among the top 10 smartphone brands in India, despite a 3 per cent year-over-year fall in the total smartphone market during the same period. Strategic positioning, ground-breaking innovations, and a focus on 5G devices in the Rs 10,000–Rs 15,000 ($122–$244) pricing range all contributed to this growth.

realme's remarkable success can be attributed to a constellation of key factors that underscore its ascent in the market. One pivotal element is their astute approach to inventory and demand management, ensuring a finely tuned supply chain.

Complemented by this, their bold and strategic sales promotions have played a significant role in propelling the brand's prominence. Moreover, realme's shrewd decision to make 5G devices accessible at compelling price points has also been pivotal in their triumph.

Marking a significant stride in innovation during the first half of 2022, realme said it has unveiled groundbreaking products that have captured the imagination of consumers.

realme launched the 10 Pro Coca Cola limited edition smartphone, created for a breath of fresh air to the yet another design-forward smartphone by realme. With a Dynamic Island-inspired Mini Capsule, realme launched the C55 smartphone raising the bar of leap forward smartphones in the Indian market.

This year, realme won numerous achievements across a range of devices that have emerged as bestsellers in their respective categories like the 11 Pro Series which broke the highest first-sale record in its segment by selling 200K+ devices across all channels, and the best-selling narzo N53 broke records by selling 100K units in just 90 minutes, emerging as the Number 1 best-selling smartphone under the Rs. 10K segment on Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

realme's market penetration has been skillfully handled through a dual-channel strategy combining online and physical channels. Collaborative partnerships with esteemed platforms such as Amazon and Flipkart have significantly bolstered their market presence.

The brand's adaptability in managing inventory has been particularly noteworthy. This agility is underscored by a series of carefully orchestrated strategies, said the company.

A well-structured product lifecycle plan has been employed, meticulously divided into distinct phases - the hot sales period, sustenance phase, and end-of-life phase. Each phase is accompanied by a judicious channel strategy, informed by invaluable feedback from channel partners.

According to the company, a critical component of their success has been the unwavering support provided to products over time. This strategy makes sure that products move smoothly throughout the retail environment, expanding their market reach.

“realme's approach to launching the next generation of phones is marked by a well-calibrated gap, allowing ample time for each iteration to flourish before the introduction of its successor,” it added.

A strong relationship between the brand and retailers is supported by regular updates on product strategy. This collaborative relationship empowers retailers to liquidate their inventory in a timely manner.

realme's meticulous oversight extends to a granular level of sales and supply management at the retail level. This approach ensures a seamless flow of products within the retail ecosystem, further enhancing their market reach, it said.

Central to realme's growth is its ""Spire Strategy,"" which prioritizes groundbreaking innovations in performance, design, and user experience. The strategy is bolstered by the ""Simple Better Strategy,"" emphasizing comprehensive innovations across product lines. With a dedicated focus on four core product lines – GT Series, Number Series, C Series, narzo Series – as well as a strategic emphasis on mid-premium devices, realme is able to meet a wide spectrum of customer demands.

Now in its fifth year of business, realme said it is still committed to offering all-encompassing experiences. The brand is getting closer to achieving its aim of being one of the top five smartphone brands globally because of its dedication to developing innovative products and encouraging user involvement.

The phenomenal success of realme in the very competitive Indian smartphone industry demonstrates both its strategic strength and dedication to innovation. By recognising the need for leap-forward innovations, implementing comprehensive strategies, and fostering local manufacturing, realme has not only achieved remarkable growth but has also become a catalyst for India's technological advancement.

Users benefit from realme's products that combine performance, design, and affordability, making it a frontrunner in the ever-evolving smartphone landscape.

In organic terms, it grew by 3.8 %.

The company raised its 2022 operating profit target a second time, now expecting EBITDA AL of approximately €41.0B (vs. prior €40.9B), which would represent a 4% year-over-year growth. The consensus estimate stood at €40.4B. The guidance increase is driven by the Group ex-T-Mobile (new EBITDA AL target of €14.0B, vs. old target of €13.9B), even if T-Mobile U.S. Inc (NASDAQ: ) did also increase its adjusted Core EBITDA outlook with its recent Q2 earnings announcement.

Following the announcement, UBS reiterated its Buy rating and a €25.70 price target on the company, noting they believe the 12% decline in share price over the past 3 months is overdone and is primarily driven by concerns about Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) potential offer of a free or heavily discounted mobile service to its U.S.-based Amazon Prime members.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Amazon earns another upgrade following Q2 beat

PhillipCapital upgraded Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $175.00 from $120.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

Amazon expects the trend of customers shifting their focus towards innovation and new workload deployments to continue into Q3/23 and anticipates the optimization efforts to ease further, suggesting that growth has bottomed out. According to PhillipCapital, there's a possibility for a renewed re-acceleration in the latter half of 2022, especially during Q4. This perspective is based on Amazon's launch of its new AI services and the gradual uptick in customer spending on AWS.

Earlier this month, the company saw upgrades from two other Wall Street firms, Exane BNP Paribas and Rosenblatt.

The rating changes were made following the company's , which exceeded Street estimates and included upbeat Q3 guidance, driven by the cloud business growth that surpassed expectations.

Roblox earns two upgrades following disappointing Q2

Roblox (NYSE: ) shares rose more than 2% premarket today after receiving upgrades from two Wall Street firms.

Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Equalweight from Underweight and raised its price target to $30.00 from $26.00.

While 2Q results were mixed, we believe that shares now fairly reflect the near term headwinds (e.g. 2H:23 bookings deceleration), balanced against the longer term opportunities to drive growth and operating leverage (e.g. AI tools and ads).

Meanwhile, Wedbush upgraded the company to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $37.00.

The company fell short of on Wednesday due to declining demand for its online games and increased competition. This resulted in more than a 22% drop in share price, wiping out almost all the gains made this year.

Marqeta upgraded following Q2 earnings and the Cash App deal

Berenberg upgraded Marqeta (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $8.00 from $5.00 following the company’s and the announcement of a four-year extension of its contract with Block (NYSE: ) to power its Cash App.

According to Berenberg, this has eliminated a significant uncertainty surrounding the company's shares.

While MQ’s near-term operating performance will reflect the economics of the Cash App renewal, which were (predictably) much reduced from what they had been in the prior deal given Block’s strong bargaining position, the company will now be able to establish a new baseline from which to grow during the next few years.

Shares closed with more than 11% gain yesterday following the announcements.

Kornit Digital upgraded at Morgan Stanley after a Q2 miss

Kornit Digital (NASDAQ: ) shares gained more than 3% premarket today after Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Overweight from Equalweight with a price target of $29.00.

Shares plunged more than 20% yesterday after the company’s Q2 revenues came in worse than expected.

According to Morgan Stanley, this reaction is overblown given a strong post-ITMA systems and upgrade pipeline that should return the company to revenue growth and EBITDA profitability in 2024.

2022-08-09, Investing.com,"Futures edge higher, Disney to report - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-edge-higher-disney-to-report--whats-moving-markets-3763410,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch up Wednesday, as investors digest a Moody's downgrade of several midsized banks that hit shares on Wall Street in the previous session. Elsewhere, Disney gears up to unveil its latest results as its ESPN division signs a partnership with gambler Penn Entertainment. Meanwhile, inflation in China contracts in July, further exacerbating concerns over the country's post-COVID recovery.

1. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Wednesday, hinting at a rebound from declines in the prior session that were sparked by a downgrade of several regional banks by Moody's.

By 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT), the contract added 91 points or 0.26%, rose by 17 points or 0.37%, and gained 65 points or 0.42%.

The three major indices on Wall Street slipped on Tuesday, dragged down in particular by bank shares after Moody's slashed its rating of 10 midsized lenders. The ratings agency highlighted concerns over sluggish deposits, elevated funding costs and risks to commercial real estate assets.

The move fanned renewed fears over the health of the U.S. banking sector, which is attempting to regain its footing following the failure of three regional lenders earlier this year. Moody's also placed six banks on review, suggesting that further downgrades could also be coming.

2. Amazon in talks to become anchor investor in Arm prior to IPO - Reuters

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is in negotiations over joining a number of other technology firms as an anchor investor in Softbank-owned chip designer Arm's planned initial public offering, according to a Reuters report that cited people familiar with the situation.

The e-commerce giant would be one of about 10 tech sector players who are reportedly eyeing a cornerstone stake in Britain-based Arm, including semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Arm hopes to list on the in September, a source told Reuters, with the company aiming to raise between $8 billion to $10 billion.

For Amazon, the investment in Arm would also highlight its increasing focus on cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud unit, uses Arm's design to produce a processing chip called Graviton.

Both Amazon and Arm declined to comment, Reuters said.

3. Disney on deck

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to headline the earnings calendar Wednesday, with the media conglomerate expected to face tough questions over recent box office busts and its sputtering television business.

This summer, ""Haunted Mansion,"" Disney's latest push to create a movie franchise out of a famous ride at its theme parks, has delivered disappointing ticket sales. ""Elemental,"" a new release from Disney's animation powerhouse Pixar, also debuted in June to a poor opening weekend.

Disney's TV division, which once financed high-profile mergers, has struggled to entice lucrative advertisers. Its streaming unit, meanwhile, is not projected to make a profit until next year.

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who returned to the role in November, has been musing publicly about potential strategic initiatives that could help reinvigorate returns. Investors, who have seen Disney's stock fall by around a fifth over the past one-year period, will likely be keen to ask Iger for more details about these plans.

4. ESPN inks sportsbook partnership with Penn Entertainment

Iger's push to revitalize flagging segments of Disney was perhaps illustrated on Tuesday, when its ESPN sports network signed a $2 billion deal with casino owner and online gambler Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: ).

Under the terms of the agreement, Penn will rebrand its U.S. sports betting portals, currently known as Barstool Sportsbook, as ESPN Bet. Penn will pay ESPN $1.5B in cash over a 10-year term and grant $500 million in warrants for its stock. ESPN Bet will launch this fall in 16 legalized betting states.

The partnership will give ESPN an extra revenue source and access to the increasingly lucrative U.S. sports gambling sector, which has been growing in popularity since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018.

It also marks a change of heart from Iger, who had previously veered away from tying together a family-friendly brand like Disney with the gambling industry. He said in an interview with Time magazine in April that the ""acceptance of sports betting has grown significantly.""

5. Chinese consumer inflation shrinks

Chinese consumer inflation shrank last month, indicating that weak local liquidity and spending are weighing down the world's second-largest economy.

The (CPI) fell 0.3% in the 12 months to July, although the number was slightly better than expectations for a drop of 0.4%, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. This came after a flat reading for June, and marks the first annual contraction in CPI since September 2021.

The inflation print comes after recent figures pointed to a deterioration in Chinese and as well as flagging growth in Chinese business activity.

It remains to be seen if Beijing will roll out further stimulus measures to boost what has been a waning post-pandemic recovery. Chinese officials have so far offered scant details on how they plan to shore up the economy."

2022-08-09, IANS,Amazon nations fall short of agreed goal to end deforestation,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-nations-fall-short-of-agreed-goal-to-end-deforestation-3762859,"Brasilia, Aug 9 (IANS) The eight countries that share the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) basin have fallen short of an agreed goal to end deforestation, leaving each nation to pursue its own conservation goals.Delegates from Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela have assembled in the Braziliancity of Belem for a two-day summit on the issue, the first such gathering in 14 years, reports the BBC.

A joint statement on Tuesday, named the Belem declaration, created a new alliance to combat deforestation, but left each country to pursue its own conservation goals.

It also said the new alliance would aim to ""prevent the Amazon from reaching a point of no return"".

The statement also included commitments to enhance co-operation on issues like water management, health, sustainable development and common negotiating positions at global climate summits.

Addressing the ""severe worsening of the climate crisis"" in his opening speech at the summit on Tuesday, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said ""the challenges of our era, and the opportunities arising from them, demand we act in unison"".

""It has never been so urgent,"" the BBC quoted the President as saying.

Differences in opinion however, was witnessed at the summit.

While Colombian President Gustavo Petro wants other countries to match his pledge to ban new oil exploration, Brazil is considering exploring new areas at the mouth of the Amazon river.

The summit came less than a week after it was revealed that the level of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has dropped to its lowest since 2017.

According to the data shared by the Brazilian space agency Inpe on Aug 3, 500 sq km of rainforest were cleared the country last month which was 66 per cent less compared to July 2022, reports the BBC.

Inpe said that the area of forest cut down in the first seven months of 2022 was smaller than that razed in the same period in 2022.

When President Lula took office in January, he had promised to halt the damage done during his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term.

Bolsonaro had promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon and forest clearances soared at the same time as resources to protect the forest were cut.

Preserving the Amazon is a central part of efforts to tackle climate change.

The rainforest is a crucial buffer in the global fight against climate change and 60 per cent of it is located in Brazil.

The billions of trees that make up the Amazon, often called ""the lungs of the planet"", hold vast amounts of carbon, accumulated over centuries, and every year their leaves continue to absorb carbon dioxide that would otherwise remain in the atmosphere and contribute to the rise in global temperatures.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Rosenblatt downgrades Apple following mixed Q3

Rosenblatt downgraded Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $198.00, following the company’s mixed , highlighted by EPS/revenue beat but weaker iPhone sales. As a result, shares fell more than 4% on Friday.

The firm noted that Apple's recent quarterly performance indicates a slowing phase.

Apple makes the most important device of the modern economy - the iPhone - has executed an impressive upgrade to Macs with the pivot to Apple Silicon, and is re-accelerating services. But a slowdown in the U.S. seems likely to last until a material new product category takes hold.

The uncertainty regarding when this new product will arrive and its potential success makes the stock less appealing, given it is now trading at near-peak absolute and relative multiples.

Amazon gets upgraded at two firms following a Q2 beat

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) earned two upgrades following better-than-expected and strong guidance, which drove the share more than 8% on Friday.

Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the company to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $140.00.

Meanwhile, Rosenblatt upgraded to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $184.00 from $111.00.

Rosenblatt’s previous worries that Street expectations were overly positive have abated. With the company shifting its focus towards efficiency in retail and AI becoming a key factor in cloud services, the potential economic challenges seem less concerning. This opens up opportunities for higher multiple consumer growth stories.

Guggenheim downgrades Cloudflare after Q2 beat

Cloudflare (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after Guggenheim downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $50.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

Cloud should have always been, we believe there is certainly execution risk associated with the attainment of this, and again believe the stock has gotten way ahead of itself.

Despite a slight improvement in , which resulted in a share price surge of more than 6% on Friday, Guggenheim doesn't expect this trend to continue into the latter half of the year. According to the firm, meeting the expectations, as guided, will be challenging unless the overall economic environment, which the company's management described as a ""grind"", sees significant improvement.

2 more analyst rating moves

CFRA downgraded General Motors (NYSE: ) to Strong Sell from Hold and cut its price target to $28.00 from $40.00.

We move to Strong Sell on the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ahead of the September 14 expiration of the current UAW contract.

Piper Sandler upgraded Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $63.00 (from $60.00), expecting the company to continue to be well-positioned. As a result, shares gained more than 2% premarket today.

Its 2Q23 results were below expectations, but there is nothing concerning about the business or its near and longterm momentum.

Amazon smashes Q2 estimates

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.

Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.

Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.

Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:

Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.

BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""

Barclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""

""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.

Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57

Apple slumps on iPhone worries

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though topped estimates.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.

Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.

As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.

Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.

In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.

Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:

We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.

Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.

AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) shares took a slide on its amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.

AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.

Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""

Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""

The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:

Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.

Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.

""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.

Qualcomm falls on soft guidance

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed amid softer smartphone demand.

The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""

CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:

Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.

Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.

PayPal plummets on gross profit worries

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.

PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.

But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.

After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""

The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""

Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:

Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?

In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.

For all of 2022, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.

Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Rosenblatt downgrades Apple following mixed Q3

Rosenblatt downgraded Apple (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $198.00, following the company’s mixed , highlighted by EPS/revenue beat but weaker iPhone sales. As a result, shares fell more than 4% on Friday.

The firm noted that Apple's recent quarterly performance indicates a slowing phase.

Apple makes the most important device of the modern economy - the iPhone - has executed an impressive upgrade to Macs with the pivot to Apple Silicon, and is re-accelerating services. But a slowdown in the U.S. seems likely to last until a material new product category takes hold.

The uncertainty regarding when this new product will arrive and its potential success makes the stock less appealing, given it is now trading at near-peak absolute and relative multiples.

Amazon gets upgraded at two firms following a Q2 beat

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) earned two upgrades following better-than-expected and strong guidance, which drove the share more than 8% on Friday.

Exane BNP Paribas upgraded the company to Neutral from Underperform with a price target of $140.00.

Meanwhile, Rosenblatt upgraded to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $184.00 from $111.00.

Rosenblatt’s previous worries that Street expectations were overly positive have abated. With the company shifting its focus towards efficiency in retail and AI becoming a key factor in cloud services, the potential economic challenges seem less concerning. This opens up opportunities for higher multiple consumer growth stories.

Guggenheim downgrades Cloudflare after Q2 beat

Cloudflare (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after Guggenheim downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $50.00, as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

Cloud should have always been, we believe there is certainly execution risk associated with the attainment of this, and again believe the stock has gotten way ahead of itself.

Despite a slight improvement in , which resulted in a share price surge of more than 6% on Friday, Guggenheim doesn't expect this trend to continue into the latter half of the year. According to the firm, meeting the expectations, as guided, will be challenging unless the overall economic environment, which the company's management described as a ""grind"", sees significant improvement.

2 more analyst rating moves

CFRA downgraded General Motors (NYSE: ) to Strong Sell from Hold and cut its price target to $28.00 from $40.00.

We move to Strong Sell on the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ahead of the September 14 expiration of the current UAW contract.

Piper Sandler upgraded Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $63.00 (from $60.00), expecting the company to continue to be well-positioned. As a result, shares gained more than 2% premarket today.

Its 2Q23 results were below expectations, but there is nothing concerning about the business or its near and longterm momentum.

With the launch of Redmi 12, the smartphone brand takes this commitment to affordability and performance to new heights.Combining cutting-edge technology with an attractive price point, the Redmi 12 aims to strike the perfect balance between premium features and accessibility.

Whether you're a photography enthusiast or a multitasking pro, this device promises to deliver an exceptional user experience.

We used the 6GB+128GB variant of the newly launched Redmi 12 in Moonstone colour for almost a month, and here is what we think about the latest device.

With its sleek design, the Redmi 12 grabs attention right from the start. The attention to detail in crafting the phone's aesthetics reflects the brand's commitment to creating a device that feels both premium and modern.

One of its key features is the elegant glass back panel, giving it a premium and sophisticated appearance. The top houses an AI triple camera setup, each lens framed with sleek silver metallic rims.

At the front, there is a 6.79-inch FHD+ Dot Display boasting a smooth 90Hz refresh rate. The display incorporates a punch-hole notch design and slim bezels on three sides, offering an immersive viewing experience.

During our testing, we noticed that every touch felt seamless and highly responsive, greatly enhancing the overall user experience. The display looked good and comfortable to use even in sunlight. Every image on the device is sharp and detailed. As we played games and watched videos, the viewing experience on this large 6.71-inch screen proved to be nothing short of amazing.

The experience has been quite satisfactory with no complaints while streaming favourite content, browsing the web, or simply scrolling through social media.

Regarding its physical attributes, the phone weighs about 198 grams and feels comfortable to hold and use with just one hand.

Moreover, the phone runs on the powerful and fast MediaTek Helio G88 processor, specifically designed to enhance gaming capabilities and provide fast application launches and seamless operation. This SoC makes the device one of the fastest in the segment.

If you're a gamer, you'll love this device! Its powerful processor and ample RAM make it ideal for gaming, delivering fast and responsive performance. When playing popular games such as Call of Duty or PUBG, the device is capable of achieving medium to high frame rates, ensuring that your gaming experience is smooth and enjoyable.

In addition, the apps loaded quickly, and multitasking between multiple apps was seamless without any issues.

Photography enthusiasts are in for a treat with the Redmi 12's advanced camera setup. The phone boasts a 50-megapixel primary camera, an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 2-megapixel macro camera. For selfies, there's an 8-megapixel front camera. The phone offers various shooting modes, including macro mode, portrait mode, night mode, and a high-resolution 50MP mode.

Talking about the camera result -- in daylight conditions, the camera performance proved to be quite impressive. We took various pictures, including skies, people, flowers, trees, and many more. In every condition, the camera performed well and was above the expectation at this price point.

The main 50MP camera took high-resolution pictures, and its night mode enabled photography even in low-light conditions.

The 8MP selfie camera excels at capturing clear, high-quality images whether you're taking selfies or making video calls. For frequent phone users looking for a seamless experience, the Redmi 12 is an excellent choice.

You can also choose between wired connectivity via the 3.5mm audio jack or wireless Bluetooth to connect your headphones or speakers, offering versatile options for an enjoyable listening experience.

With its 5,000mAh battery, the Redmi 12 offers an impressive battery life that can easily power you through a busy day. During our testing, the device proved capable of lasting for an entire day of heavy use, including photography, video streaming, and playing games.

Additionally, the Redmi 12 comes with an IP53-rated splash resistance (very few devices in this segment).

The company is offering the device in two variants -- 4GB RAM + 128GB storage and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage -- for Rs 9,999 and Rs 10,499, respectively, across Mi.com, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Mi Home and Mi Studio, and authorised retail partners.

Conclusion: The Redmi 12 is a game-changer in the mid-range smartphone market, offering a perfect blend of affordability and performance. With its premium design, powerful hardware, exceptional camera capabilities, and long-lasting battery, this device is poised to revolutionise the way we perceive budget-friendly smartphones.

Amazon smashes Q2 estimates

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) surged 8% Friday after the tech giant blew out of the water and nicely topped guidance revenue, riding high off strength in its cloud business.

Amazon said its profit came to $0.65 for the quarter - $0.30 better than the consensus of $0.35 - on revenue of $134.4 billion, which also surpassed the $131.45B average analyst estimate.

Amazon Web Services, which comprised 70% of its Q2 operating profit, jumped 12% to $22.1B - ahead of estimates for 10.2% growth. The company said this surge came as customers ""started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment.""

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B vs. estimates for $138.28B.

Bernstein called the print ""a defining moment"" during CEO Andy Jassy's tenure, which started about two years ago, and hiked the company's price target by $20 to $175 per share. Bernstein added:

Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right.

BofA said Amazon remains ""our top stock in sector"" given Amazon's retail cost improvement efforts, saying it expects ""several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency."" BofA added that AWS is ""seemingly poised to accelerate"" given the ""end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps.""

Barclays concurred, writing that AWS is ""likely re-accelerating on regular/AI workloads,"" adding that ""retail growth is steady and margins may overshoot the 2018 peak.""

""It's finally time to sit back and enjoy the ride,"" Barclays wrote.

Shares booked a weekly gain of 4.8% gain to $139.57

Apple slumps on iPhone worries

Apple shares (NASDAQ: ) lost 4.8% Friday after the iPhone maker reported its third consecutive quarterly sales drop, even though topped estimates.

iPhone revenue, which makes up nearly half of Apple's total top line, fell to $39.67 billion from $40.67B a year earlier, missing estimates of $39.91B. And revenue overall totaled $81.8B - better than the $81.73 consensus, but down from $83B a year earlier.

Strength in Apple's services business helped offset the soft iPhone sales: Revenue from Apple News, Apple TV+, and iCloud, among other service units, grew to $21.21B from $19.60B a year earlier, ahead of estimates of $20.76B.

As for its bottom line, earnings per share came to $1.26, also topping estimates for $1.19.

Regarding the iPhone softness, in the earnings call, CFO Luca Maestri said the company expects iPhone and services performance to ""accelerate from the June quarter"" year over year. He also predicted more double-digit declines in Mac and iPad sales, ""particularly on the Mac,"" due to difficult comparisons vs. the prior year.

In fiscal Q3, iPad revenue fell by 20% to $5.79B year-on-year in Q3. missing Wall Street estimates of $6.41B.

Still, given the expected acceleration in iPhone sales and services, as well as the gross margin expansion, Citi opened a 90-day positive catalyst watch on AAPL stock.

""Post Jun-Q earnings through new Phone launch the stock historically outperformed NASDAQ 5 out 7 times and S&P500 all 7 times, or 8% on average since 2016,"" Citi wrote in a note.

On the other hand, BofA remains sidelined:

We remain Neutral as positive catalysts of new product introduction and stable iPhones are offset by a potentially weaker consumer spending environment. ...The guidance suggests typical launch timing for iPhones but with the backdrop of a weak US smartphone market we think it’s unlikely that iPhone rev significantly re-accelerates.

Shares ended the week down 7.2% to $181.99.

AMD sees a roller coaster week after Q2

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) shares took a slide on its amid analyst concerns about guidance, but the stock strongly recovered after Morgan Stanley said the selloff was overdone.

AMD's Q2 EPS came in at $0.58 per share, a penny better than consensus, and Q3 guidance also topped consensus - but Bernstein said it fears estimates ""remain too high"" amid optimism around AI ""and the stock... looks a little stretched to us,"" according to Reuters.

Oppenheimer was also cautious, writing, ""We remain sidelined as AMD’s AI strategy proves out.""

Revenue totaled $5.4B, better than the $5.32B analyst expectations, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI engagements climbed by more than seven times ""as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct accelerators at scale.""

The stock more than recovered, ending with a 1.6% gain for the week to $115.82, after Morgan Stanley said it sees the stock as a ""significant outperformer"" relative to other chip stocks at current levels. The analyst added:

Guidance for flat y/y servers in 3q - up 15-20% q/q - with clear eyes about the current cloud weakness should be an indication that share gains and the delayed Genoa ramp are in good shape. We expected the stock to be up meaningfully.

Citi, for its part, upgraded AMD to Buy from Neutral immediately after the Q2 results, bumping its price target by $16 to $136 per share.

""We thought AMD’s AI products (MI300) would be margin dilutive and investors would eventually care about the expensive valuation on AMD, and we were wrong on both counts,"" the analysts said.

Qualcomm falls on soft guidance

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% Thursday after the company reported underwhelming guidance for the current quarter and delivered mixed amid softer smartphone demand.

The chipmaker reported adjusted EPS of $1.87 on revenue of $8.44 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.81 on revenue of $8.51B.

For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company guided EPS in the range of $1.80 to $2 - the midpoint of which is below Wall Street estimates for $1.94 - on revenue of between $8.1B to $8.9B, which compares with estimates for $8.77B.

""The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2022 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown,"" the company said.

Deutsche Bank downgraded the QCOM stock to Hold with a price target lowered by $10 to $120 per share. While the company was in line with the analysts' estimates, it was concerned with management's ""soft commentary"" around its December quarter and ""incremental headwinds in 2024.""

CFRA, meanwhile, lifted the price target by $2 to $125 per share on the Hold-rated QCOM stock. The firm wrote:

Although we expect QCOM's under-shipping of true demand is likely to come to an end over the next 3-6 months, we remain wary of QCOM to potentially start losing Apple business by late CY 24.

Qualcomm shares partially recovered on Friday, but ended the week with a 6.4% loss to $121.50.

PayPal plummets on gross profit worries

PayPal (NASDAQ: ) plunged more than 12% Thursday, after edging out top- and bottom-line estimates, on worries regarding its gross profit growth.

PayPal said it earned $1.16 per share in Q2 on revenue of $7.29 billion. Analysts polled by InvestingPro anticipated EPS of $1.15 on revenue of $7.27B.

But the company's total payment volume (TPV), or transaction revenue less transaction expenses and transaction losses, rose just 1% from the prior year.

After the print, Evercore ISI downgraded the stock to In Line from Outperform, saying it sees ""increasing headwinds to revenue and earnings growth"" due to ""intensifying competition, evidenced by the sequential loss of 2.5 million consumer accounts (0.6% of total accounts) combined with nearly 300 basis point of transaction margin pressure.""

The analyst added: ""Without a clear path to year-over-year transaction margin expansion, we see limited scope for earnings outperformance.""

Bernstein also voiced concerns about TPV growth pressures, adding that gross profit (GP) growth ""is essentially the true revenue for the company."" The analyst added:

Transaction GP is a critical health metric, especially because TPV growth is an outcome of many businesses with vastly different gross margins. ... On surface, transaction GP growth looks very weak. Are the gross margin pressures structural or transitory?

In terms of guidance, PayPal expects Q3 adjusted EPS to grow 13% to 14%, to a range of $1.22 to $1.24, on 8% revenue growth to about $7.4B. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS and revenue of $1.22 and $7.33B, respectively.

For all of 2022, EPS is expected at $4.95, just above expectations of $4.94.

Shares ultimately lost more than 16% for the week to $62.75.

2022-08-04, Investing.com,Amazon shares rise as slowdown in cloud unit growth shows signs of abating,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-shares-rise-as-slowdown-in-cloud-unit-growth-shows-signs-of-abating-3757366,"Investing.com -- Shares in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) jumped by more than 9% on Friday after the e-commerce giant said that growth at its key cloud computing division slowed by less than expected in the second quarter, sparking hopes for a turnaround at the much-scrutinized unit.

The business, known as Amazon Web Services, posted revenue growth of 12% in the period ended on June 30. Bloomberg consensus estimates had called for an uptick of 9.48%.

Amazon previously warned that revenue at AWS had slowed to 11% in April, down from 16% in the first quarter and 29% in 2022, a trend that has been largely chalked up to clients attempting to squeeze as much as they can out of their cloud spending. However, Amazon executives noted that generative artificial intelligence has boosted demand for developing new computing workloads.

""[T]here's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS,"" Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in a call with analysts following the release of the results.

Even though Amazon flagged that economic uncertainties remain, online store sales at the company jumped by 5% excluding currency effects to $53 billion, topping expectations.

The increase, along with recent cost cuts that have included steep headcount reductions, boosted income per share up to $0.65 and total revenue higher to $134.4B -- both above projections.

Analysts at Rosenblatt upgraded their rating of Amazon to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and increased their price target for the stock to $184 from $111, citing a ""constructive"" earnings report.

""As the business resets, with efficiency a new focus for retail, and AI an emerging driver in cloud, the risk of impending economic headwinds looks less worrying, opening the door to higher multiple consumer growth stories,"" the Rosenblatt analysts said."

The tech sector has led the way on the promise of artificial intelligence to the industry and in hope the would reach the end of its interest rate increases sooner rather than later.

Saudi Arabia extended on Thursday a voluntary oil production cut of one million barrels per day until the end of September, while Russia has also said it will cut its oil exports by 300,000 barrels per day next month.

These cuts came just before a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies later this session, which makes further cuts from the cartel unlikely.

Amazon.com rose more than 8% in pre-market Friday trading following the report.

Amazon reported Q2 of $0.65 on revenue of $134.4 billion, beating estimates of $0.35 on revenue of $131.45B. Net sales in North America rose 11% to $82.5B year-on-year in Q2.

Amazon Web Services, its fast-growing cloud revenue segment, grew 12%, to $22.1B, ahead of estimates of 10.2%. The cloud segment accounted for 70% of Amazon's operating profit in Q2.

""Our AWS growth stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment,"" the company said.

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B, beating Wall Street estimates of $138.28B. Operating income for Q3 was guided in a range of $5.5B to $8.5B.

Amazon didn't provide segment guidance on the earnings call.

Bernstein analysts hiked the price target by $20 to $175 per share.

""This print marks a defining moment in Andy Jassy's 2-year tenure at the helm. Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right,"" they said in a client note.

BofA analysts also lifted the price target by $20 (new PT of $174) ahead of the expected AWS acceleration.

""Amazon is reaping rewards from (at least) a year’s worth of retail cost improvement efforts, with US regionalization now driving margins higher. We expect several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency (2Q headcount still down y/y), and with AWS seemingly poised to accelerate (end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps), Amazon remains our top stock in sector,"" analysts wrote.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 10.9% after the online retail giant’s results showed signs that both its growth engines, e-commerce and cloud-computing, were faring well in an uncertain economy.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 2.9% after the iPhone maker warned that it was headed for the fourth straight quarter of declining sales as demand continues to slow for its flagship device, especially in developed markets.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 1.6% after the parent of Google said it had slashed its stake in Robinhood (NASDAQ: ), up 1.1%, by nearly 90%, days after the trading app said it had turned a profit for the first time as a public company.

DraftKings (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 3.9% after the betting company reported a surprise quarterly profit, and offered up an upbeat full-year sales forecast as new sports-betting customers emerge.

Dropbox (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 7% after the file-hosting service beat expectations with strong second-quarter earnings and sales growth.

(NASDAQ: ) jumped by more than 9% on Friday after the e-commerce giant said that growth at its key cloud computing division slowed by less than expected in the second quarter, sparking hopes for a turnaround at the much-scrutinized unit.

The business, known as Amazon Web Services, posted revenue growth of 12% in the period ended on June 30. Bloomberg consensus estimates had called for an uptick of 9.48%.

Amazon previously warned that revenue at AWS had slowed to 11% in April, down from 16% in the first quarter and 29% in 2022, a trend that has been largely chalked up to clients attempting to squeeze as much as they can out of their cloud spending. However, Amazon executives noted that generative artificial intelligence has boosted demand for developing new computing workloads.

""[T]here's a lot of growth in front of us on AWS,"" Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said in a call with analysts following the release of the results.

Even though Amazon flagged that economic uncertainties remain, online store sales at the company jumped by 5% excluding currency effects to $53 billion, topping expectations.

The increase, along with recent cost cuts that have included steep headcount reductions, boosted income per share up to $0.65 and total revenue higher to $134.4B -- both above projections.

Analysts at Rosenblatt upgraded their rating of Amazon to ""buy"" from ""neutral"" and increased their price target for the stock to $184 from $111, citing a ""constructive"" earnings report.

""As the business resets, with efficiency a new focus for retail, and AI an emerging driver in cloud, the risk of impending economic headwinds looks less worrying, opening the door to higher multiple consumer growth stories,"" the Rosenblatt analysts said."

Amazon.com rose more than 8% in pre-market Friday trading following the report.

Amazon reported Q2 of $0.65 on revenue of $134.4 billion, beating estimates of $0.35 on revenue of $131.45B. Net sales in North America rose 11% to $82.5B year-on-year in Q2.

Amazon Web Services, its fast-growing cloud revenue segment, grew 12%, to $22.1B, ahead of estimates of 10.2%. The cloud segment accounted for 70% of Amazon's operating profit in Q2.

""Our AWS growth stabilized as customers started shifting from cost optimization to new workload deployment,"" the company said.

For the third quarter, the company expects revenue of $138B to $143B, beating Wall Street estimates of $138.28B. Operating income for Q3 was guided in a range of $5.5B to $8.5B.

Amazon didn't provide segment guidance on the earnings call.

Bernstein analysts hiked the price target by $20 to $175 per share.

""This print marks a defining moment in Andy Jassy's 2-year tenure at the helm. Amazon fired on all cylinders: AWS finally stabilizing and now a coiled spring; Retail performance hanging in with a weakened consumer; N. American retail margins are back to pre-pandemic levels and accelerating alongside compressing fulfillment windows — impressive; and aggregate operating profits are up and to the right,"" they said in a client note.

BofA analysts also lifted the price target by $20 (new PT of $174) ahead of the expected AWS acceleration.

""Amazon is reaping rewards from (at least) a year’s worth of retail cost improvement efforts, with US regionalization now driving margins higher. We expect several more quarters of margin benefits from increasing retail efficiency (2Q headcount still down y/y), and with AWS seemingly poised to accelerate (end of Cloud spending optimization cycle amidst easing comps), Amazon remains our top stock in sector,"" analysts wrote.

Quarterly earnings continue, Maersk warns of demand hit

In Europe, the corporate earnings season continued Friday, with AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE: ) stock falling 1.7% after the shipping giant warned of a steeper decline in global demand for shipping containers by sea this year prompted by muted economic growth and customers reducing inventories.

Credit Agricole (EPA: ) stock rose 4.4% after France's second-largest listed bank reported better-than-expected quarterly , driven by strong insurance and consumer finance performances.

Airbus Group (EPA: ) stock rose 0.2% after the European aircraft manufacturer deliveries rose 11% in the first seven months of the year to 381 airplanes.

Still, a lot of attention will be on Wall Street after Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, posted its third straight quarter of declining sales and predicted a similar performance in the current period.

On the flip side, online retail giant Amazon impressed as it reported sales growth and profit that as hefty cost cuts delivered a leaner company.

Talk of additional Chinese stimulus helps tone

European stocks were given a minor boost early Friday on the back of more talk from the Chinese government of additional stimulus measures to boost the second-largest economy in the world, and a major export market for many of Europe’s largest companies.

However, the day’s highlight will be the release of the official U.S. , which is expected to show payrolls rose 200,000 in July, a small reduction from the 209,000 jobs created the prior month.

Any signs of resilience in the jobs market would likely provide the Federal Reserve with more headroom to keep raising interest rates.

2022-08-04, Investing.com,European stock futures higher; German factory orders impress,https://in.investing.com/news/european-stock-futures-higher-german-factory-orders-impress-3755892,"Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open higher Friday, as investors digest earnings from tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) ahead of the release of the eagerly-awaited U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.

At 02:00 ET (06:00 GMT), the contract in Germany traded 0.6% higher, in France climbed 0.6% and the contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.

Talk of additional Chinese stimulus helps tone

European stocks look set to start the final day of a volatile week on a positive note, helped by more talk from the Chinese government of additional stimulus measures to boost the second-largest economy in the world, and a major export market for many of Europe’s largest companies.

China’s top economic committees said in a joint statement on Friday that the government will unlock more measures to boost consumer spending and improve local liquidity, but offered no major details.

Crowded economic data slate

However, there are plenty of economic data releases scheduled in Europe this session which could alter this healthy tone.

It will not be that do this though, as they climbed a chunky 7% on the month in June, a much better result than the drop of 2.0% expected.

Investor attention will also be on construction PMI data from the , and , as well as industrial production for , and and eurozone .

However, the day’s highlight will be the release of the official U.S. , which is expected to show payrolls rose 200,000 in July, a small reduction from the 209,000 jobs created the prior month.

Any signs of resilience in the jobs market would likely provide the Federal Reserve with more headroom to keep raising interest rates.

Apple disappoints with declining sales

In Europe, quarterly results are due from the likes of French banking giant Credit Agricole (EPA: ) and shipping conglomerate AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE: ).

That said, a lot of attention will be on Wall Street after Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, posted its third straight quarter of declining sales and predicted a similar performance in the current period.

On the flip side, online retail giant Amazon impressed as it reported sales growth and profit that as hefty cost cuts delivered a leaner company.

Crude prices edge higher after further output cuts

Oil prices edged higher Friday, on course for the sixth consecutive week of gains on the back of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s largest producers, tightening global supplies.

Saudi Arabia extended on Thursday a voluntary oil production cut of 1 million barrels per day until the end of September, while Russia has also said it will cut its oil exports by 300,000 barrels per day next month.

These cuts came just before a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies later this session, which makes further cuts from the cartel unlikely.

By 02:00 ET, the futures traded 0.3% higher at $81.76 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.2% to $85.30.

Additionally, rose 0.1% to $1,970.15/oz, while traded 0.1% higher at 1.0958."

AWS segment’s operating income was $5.4 billion, compared with operating income of $5.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022.

“It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon. Our AWS growth stabilised as customers started shifting from cost optimisation to new workload deployment, and AWS has continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO.

The operating income was $7.7 billion, exceeding the top end of Amazon's guidance ranges.

“AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance,” said Jassy.

“We've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilise during Q2 where we reported 12 per cent year-over-year growth,” he added.

Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of the top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40 per cent better price performance than other leading x86 processors.

Brian Olsavsky, Chief Financial Officer at Amazon, said that during the quarter, they also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across North America and international segments but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases.

“Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22 per cent year over year,” he informed.

Cook said that Apple views artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.“And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,” Cook told CNBC late on Thursday, as the company reported strong June quarter results, driven by stronger services sales that grew 8 per cent (year-on-year)

“On a research basis, we’ve been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,” Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and it was largely missing from its quarterly report too.

On the other hand, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CEO Andy Jassy said that every single team at the company has “multiple generative AI initiatives going right now"".

At the company’s Q2 earnings call, Jassy stressed just how important AI is across the company as a whole.

“They range from things that help us be more cost-effective and streamlined in how we run operations and various businesses, to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. It’s true in our Stores business, it’s true in our AWS business, it’s true in our advertising business, it’s true in all our devices,” he told the analysts late on Thursday.

“You can just imagine what we’re working on with respect to Alexa there — it’s true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It (AI) is going to be at the heart of what we do. It’s a significant investment and focus for us,” Jassy added.

He said that Amazon could announce some generative AI-based improvements for Alexa at its upcoming devices event on September 20.

2022-08-04, IANS,Amazon deforestation falls to lowest level in 6 yrs,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-deforestation-falls-to-lowest-level-in-6-yrs-3755713,"Brasilia, Aug 4 (IANS) The level of deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest in Brazil has dropped to its lowest since 2017, according to official data.According to the data shared by the Brazilian space agency Inpe on Thursday, 500 sq km of rainforest were cleared the country last month which was 66 per cent less compared to July 2022, reports the BBC.

Inpe said that the area of forest cut down in the first seven months of 2022 was smaller than that razed in the same period in 2022.

The agency's data further revealed that the authorities are going after those engaging in illegal logging.

The fines imposed in the first seven months of this year have topped $400 million, a rise of almost 150 per cent, the BBC reported citing Inpe as saying.

When President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in January, he had promised to halt the damage done during his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term.

Bolsonaro had promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon and forest clearances soared at the same time as resources to protect the forest were cut.

Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Lula said an Amazon summit next week which will be attended by leaders from countries that share the world's largest rainforest, is something the whole world should watch.

He argued that all too often, promises made at global summits were not met, but he insisted that ""where there's a will, there's a way"".

The Amazon rainforest is a crucial buffer in the global fight against climate change and 60 per cent of it is located in Brazil.

Due to the large number of trees growing in the Amazon, it is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" on account of how the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

Quarterly earnings continue, Maersk warns of demand hit

In Europe, the corporate earnings season continued Friday, with AP Moeller-Maersk (CSE: ) stock falling 1.7% after the shipping giant warned of a steeper decline in global demand for shipping containers by sea this year prompted by muted economic growth and customers reducing inventories.

Credit Agricole (EPA: ) stock rose 4.4% after France's second-largest listed bank reported better-than-expected quarterly , driven by strong insurance and consumer finance performances.

Airbus Group (EPA: ) stock rose 0.2% after the European aircraft manufacturer deliveries rose 11% in the first seven months of the year to 381 airplanes.

Still, a lot of attention will be on Wall Street after Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, posted its third straight quarter of declining sales and predicted a similar performance in the current period.

On the flip side, online retail giant Amazon impressed as it reported sales growth and profit that as hefty cost cuts delivered a leaner company.

Talk of additional Chinese stimulus helps tone

European stocks were given a minor boost early Friday on the back of more talk from the Chinese government of additional stimulus measures to boost the second-largest economy in the world, and a major export market for many of Europe’s largest companies.

China’s top economic committees said in a joint statement on Friday that the government will unlock more measures to boost consumer spending and improve local liquidity, but offered no major details.

Cloudy eurozone economic picture

Crude prices edge higher after further output cuts

Oil prices edged higher Friday, on course for the sixth consecutive week of gains on the back of output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the world’s largest producers, tightening global supplies.

Saudi Arabia extended on Thursday a voluntary oil production cut of 1 million barrels per day until the end of September, while Russia has also said it will cut its oil exports by 300,000 barrels per day next month.

These cuts came just before a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies later this session, which makes further cuts from the cartel unlikely.

AWS segment’s operating income was $5.4 billion, compared with operating income of $5.7 billion in the second quarter of 2022.

“It was another strong quarter of progress for Amazon. Our AWS growth stabilised as customers started shifting from cost optimisation to new workload deployment, and AWS has continued to add to its meaningful leadership position in the cloud with a slew of generative AI releases,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO.

The operating income was $7.7 billion, exceeding the top end of Amazon's guidance ranges.

“AWS remains the clear cloud infrastructure leader with a significant leadership position with respect to number of customers, size of partner ecosystem, breadth of functionality, and the strongest operational performance,” said Jassy.

“We've seen AWS' revenue growth rate stabilise during Q2 where we reported 12 per cent year-over-year growth,” he added.

Today, more than 50,000 customers use AWS' Graviton chips and AWS Compute instances, including 98 of the top 100 Amazon EC2 customers, and these chips have about 40 per cent better price performance than other leading x86 processors.

Brian Olsavsky, Chief Financial Officer at Amazon, said that during the quarter, they also saw improvements in macroeconomic indicators across North America and international segments but continue to see customers trading down and seeking value in their purchases.

“Delivery speed has been a key area of focus over the last several quarters and we reached record levels during Q2. Prime members love the faster ship speeds and are shopping more often. Advertising revenue remained strong, up 22 per cent year over year,” he informed.

Cook said that Apple views artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) as fundamental core technologies.“And they are virtually embedded in every product that we build,” Cook told CNBC late on Thursday, as the company reported strong June quarter results, driven by stronger services sales that grew 8 per cent (year-on-year)

“On a research basis, we’ve been doing research on AI and machine learning, including generative AI, for years,” Cook was quoted as saying.

Apple does not talk much about generative AI and it was largely missing from its quarterly report too.

On the other hand, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CEO Andy Jassy said that every single team at the company has “multiple generative AI initiatives going right now"".

At the company’s Q2 earnings call, Jassy stressed just how important AI is across the company as a whole.

“They range from things that help us be more cost-effective and streamlined in how we run operations and various businesses, to the absolute heart of every customer experience in which we offer. It’s true in our Stores business, it’s true in our AWS business, it’s true in our advertising business, it’s true in all our devices,” he told the analysts late on Thursday.

“You can just imagine what we’re working on with respect to Alexa there — it’s true in our entertainment businesses, every single one. It (AI) is going to be at the heart of what we do. It’s a significant investment and focus for us,” Jassy added.

He said that Amazon could announce some generative AI-based improvements for Alexa at its upcoming devices event on September 20.

2022-08-04, IANS,Amazon deforestation falls to lowest level in 6 yrs,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-deforestation-falls-to-lowest-level-in-6-yrs-3755713,"Brasilia, Aug 4 (IANS) The level of deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest in Brazil has dropped to its lowest since 2017, according to official data.According to the data shared by the Brazilian space agency Inpe on Thursday, 500 sq km of rainforest were cleared the country last month which was 66 per cent less compared to July 2022, reports the BBC.

Inpe said that the area of forest cut down in the first seven months of 2022 was smaller than that razed in the same period in 2022.

The agency's data further revealed that the authorities are going after those engaging in illegal logging.

The fines imposed in the first seven months of this year have topped $400 million, a rise of almost 150 per cent, the BBC reported citing Inpe as saying.

When President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in January, he had promised to halt the damage done during his predecessor Jair Bolsonaro's four-year term.

Bolsonaro had promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon and forest clearances soared at the same time as resources to protect the forest were cut.

Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Lula said an Amazon summit next week which will be attended by leaders from countries that share the world's largest rainforest, is something the whole world should watch.

He argued that all too often, promises made at global summits were not met, but he insisted that ""where there's a will, there's a way"".

The Amazon rainforest is a crucial buffer in the global fight against climate change and 60 per cent of it is located in Brazil.

Due to the large number of trees growing in the Amazon, it is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" on account of how the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

2022-08-03, Investing.com,"Apple and Amazon to report, Adidas narrows loss forecast - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-amazon-to-report-adidas-narrows-loss-forecast--whats-moving-markets-3753598,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures slip, suggesting an extension in declines on Wall Street seen in the prior session, as traders continued to gauge the implications of Fitch's downgrade of America's credit rating earlier this week. Elsewhere, investors gear up for the release of quarterly results from tech giants Apple and Amazon, while Adidas sees a smaller 2022 loss thanks to strong sales of its leftover stock of Yeezy shoes.

1. Futures edge lower after sell-off

U.S. stock futures pointed into the red Thursday, a day after a U.S. credit rating downgrade by ratings agency Fitch sparked a sell-off on Wall Street.

At 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT), the contract lost 85 points or 0.24%, shed 12 points or 0.28%, and dipped by 55 points or 0.36%.

The benchmark posted its biggest drop since April in the prior session, while the tech-heavy slumped to its worst day since February.

Fitch lowered the U.S.'s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from the top-most level of AAA on Tuesday, citing worries around the country's fiscal position and governance standards. The announcements cooled a series of recent gains for stocks.

Attention will likely now turn back to this week's flurry of corporate earnings, with tech giants Amazon and Apple set to report their latest quarterly results after the closing bell.

On the economic calendar, investors will have a chance to parse through weekly data, which will serve as a prelude to the release of the all-important for July on Friday.

2. Qualcomm's sales forecast disappoints

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) has unveiled sales guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter that missed expectations and announced plans to slash jobs as recent weakness in the smartphone market failed to ease.

The U.S. chip designer said it now expects revenue in the current three-month period to come in between $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion. Analysts had seen the figure at $8.70B.

A slump in end-user demand for handsets, along with many smartphone makers choosing to use existing chip supplies to manufacture their devices, both factored into the outlook, the company noted. The smartphone market has faced headwinds as inflation-conscious customers rein in spending on non-essential items and replacement cycles lengthen. According to research firm Canalys, global smartphone shipments dropped by 13% in the first quarter of 2022.

Adding to these underlying issues, the San Diego-based business said it now does not foresee ""any material revenue"" from Huawei because it does not have a license to sell 5G chips to the Chinese telecom group. Qualcomm also flagged that it would likely be hit with ""significant"" restructuring charges linked to workforce reductions.

Shares in the firm fell sharply in premarket U.S. trading.

3. Apple and Amazon ahead

Major tech sector bellwether Apple (NASDAQ: ) and e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are scheduled to announce their quarterly earnings Thursday, in two of the most closely-watched releases in what has been a busy week of corporate results.

For Apple, analysts mostly expect the California-based iPhone maker to report a third straight quarter of declining revenue. The focus will likely be on any details the company may choose to give about its current quarter, which ends in September.

Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, which typically includes new smartphone releases and back-to-school laptop purchases, can be a signpost for the company's performance heading into the critical holiday season. But the period may have even greater influence this year, as it could provide clues into whether the U.S. economy can avoid a broader meltdown after a string of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

At Amazon, the group's key cloud computing division will be in the spotlight.

Bellevue, Washington-based Amazon previously flagged that a deceleration in growth in the prior quarter at the unit, Amazon Web Services, continued into April. The slowdown may be reflective of a broader weakness in cloud spending as inflationary pressures persuade clients and individuals to pull back on some tech expenditures.

Meanwhile, as it was with their Big Tech peers last week, executives at both Apple and Amazon may also field questions from analysts about their plans to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.

4. Adidas sees smaller 2022 loss after Yeezy destocking

Adidas (ETR: ) has narrowed its projected 2022 loss thanks to strong demand for the leftover stock of its Yeezy shoe brand, the German sports apparel group said on Thursday.

The company had halted sales of the sneaker after it cut ties with designer Ye last year following antisemitic remarks made by the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.

In order to avoid a deep write-down on its remaining stock of Yeezy-branded products, Adidas announced in May that it would sell some of this inventory and donate the proceeds to different charities that fight antisemitism and racism.

In the second quarter, these sales generated around €400 million (€1 = $1.0926), leading Adidas to reduce its expected annual loss to €450M, down from its prior guidance for a loss of €700M. Adidas also earmarked €110M for charitable donations.

Analysts cited by Reuters said that a second batch of Yeezy stock sales will likely attract solid demand as well, albeit not as profitable as the initial release. Adidas noted that its full-year outlook does not include the impact of another Yeezy stock drop.

5. Oil retreats amid signs of tightening supplies, Fitch downgrade

Oil prices fell Thursday on worries about the global economic outlook, even after a record drop in U.S. inventories indicated a substantial tightening in crude markets.

Official data, released Wednesday, showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank by over 17 million barrels in the week to July 28 - the biggest drop recorded in data stretching back to 1982.

The Fitch downgrade of the U.S. credit rating also dented risk appetite for a second consecutive day, weighing on oil prices. In the prior session, crude fell from more than three-month highs in the wake of the ratings agency's announcement.

By 05:11 ET, futures traded 0.18% lower at $79.35 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.24% to $83.00."

Graphics chip major Nvidia gained over 50 per cent in market cap in Q2 and almost 200 per cent since January.

“Nvidia continued to spearhead the surge. The company, which witnessed over 90 per cent increase in market value in Q1 2022, had another impressive quarter, recording a 52 per cent increase in market value in Q2 2022,” said Gracio Benher, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.

Other companies, which had seen impressive gains in stock values in Q2 2022 include Meta (NASDAQ: ) (33.8 per cent), Oracle (NYSE: ) (28.9 per cent), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26.4 per cent). They recorded overall gains of 130 per cent, 45 per cent and 56.1 per cent, respectively, since the beginning of 2022.

The prediction of a global recession and the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest-rate induced spending squeeze saw tech stocks experiencing a tipsy-topsy journey during most part of H1 2022.

However, it did not deter the top companies gain record valuation.

Meta has gained the approval of investors, after the company’s efficiency initiatives showed positive impact on the latest quarter results, with other factors being improved monetisation from reels content and enhanced ad targeting.

At the other extreme, Tencent, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: ) witnessed their market value eroding during Q2 2022, said the report.

Tencent, which saw its market value recovering in Q1 2022, slipped back to Q4 2022 level by the end of Q2 2022, impacted by a slowdown in Chinese economy, heavy sell-off by Prosus, one of its major stakeholders, and fear among investor community about potential sanctions that restrict exporting of select chips into China.

Weak demand for smartphones and tablets impacted Qualcomm’s top-line performance in recent quarters, impacting its market value.

“Looking ahead, tech companies offering hardware and software solutions for AI tools and cloud-based solutions are likely to witness market rally for their stocks,” said Benher.

Let's delve into the remarkable tale of realme's transformation, where ambition meets reality, and boundaries are shattered.

c) C Series: Catering to stylish entry-level users, the C Series offered a perfect balance of design and functionality, making it an appealing choice for budget-conscious consumers.

d) narzo Series: The stunning smartphone series for next generation users that delivered a comprehensive experience, blending style and functionality.

realme embarked on its journey in India with remarkable momentum, swiftly becoming one of the fastest-growing smartphone brands. Through localized events and products, the brand fostered a strong bond with Indian consumers, addressing their unique preferences and needs.

Within just three years, realme achieved an astounding feat, selling over 100 million units, solidifying its position as an established market leader in India. This transition showcased the brand's adaptability and prowess in a highly competitive landscape.

However, the path to success was not without hurdles. In 2022, realme faced daunting challenges from global economic impacts, the Covid-19 pandemic's aftermath, and inflation. Yet, the brand demonstrated remarkable resilience, opting for the difficult but right decisions when confronted with adversity.

By remaining strategically agile and determined, realme rebounded and continued its journey towards sustained growth and success. This year, realme won numerous achievements across a range of devices that have emerged as bestsellers in their respective categories.

To achieve this ambitious goal, the company is actively making strategic investments in the necessary infrastructure and capabilities. It is also exploring opportunities to start local manufacturing for its laptops and tablets in India, to contribute further to the growth of India's tech ecosystem and bolster the country's position as a manufacturing hub.

With all such initiatives, realme continues to empower localisation in India and expand its footprint to explore new avenues. The brand’s dedication to 'Make in India' remains unwavering, promising a future filled with more milestones in local manufacturing and strengthening the Indian economy.

realme's journey of empowering localization in India over the last five years has been nothing short of impressive. From setting ambitious goals to overcoming challenges, the brand's commitment to innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction has been the driving force behind its success.

By fostering strong connections with the Indian audience, embracing strategic agility, and localizing its operations, realme has not only become a prominent player in the Indian market but also established itself as a brand synonymous with trust and innovation in the global smartphone industry.

2022-08-03, Investing.com,Asian stocks fall as risk-off persists after U.S. rating cut,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-as-riskoff-persists-after-us-rating-cut-3753041,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street after Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating somewhat dented sentiment, while strong payrolls data also pushed up concerns over rising interest rates.

Fitch had earlier this week downgraded its rating for the U.S. government to AA+ from AAA, citing concerns over fiscal spending and increased clashes between the Democrats and Republicans.

While analysts downplayed the direct impact of the downgrade, the move still triggered a wave of selling across global stock markets, as investors locked in profits after a strong run through June and July.

Technology stocks see extended profit taking, strong payrolls data weighs

Tech stocks, which had seen strong gains over the past two months, bore the brunt of selling pressure, with South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s index falling 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.

Stocks were also rattled by stronger-than-expected U.S. data on Wednesday, which boosted the dollar and Treasury yields as markets positioned for a similar reading from official data due on Friday.

Resilience in the U.S. economy - particularly in the labor market - gives the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep raising interest rates, which bodes poorly for risk-driven stock markets.

Tech stockholders were also on edge ahead of earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Broader Asian markets retreated. Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the index sliding 1.6%, while the broader fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan’s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.

Chinese stocks limit losses as PMI data signals some strength

China’s and indexes fell less than their peers on Thursday, as a showed that the country’s services sector grew more than expected in July.

The reading indicated that steady retail spending and services demand was still keeping some facets of Chinese business activity afloat, and could help support a bigger economic recovery this year, especially if the government rolls out more stimulus measures.

But investors appear to have somewhat soured on the prospect of more Chinese stimulus, given that officials have offered up few details on how the measures will be carried out. The country's biggest economic engines - manufacturing and real estate - are also struggling despite promises of more support."

Tech stocks have been rallying all year on the prospect of easing conditions for interest rates. Fitch downgraded the U.S. on Tuesday night, citing increased polarity in Washington over debt ceiling and other negotiations that point to a deterioration in governance standards. The Treasury Department pushed back at the firm's assertions.

Still, it was enough to weigh on markets amid a deluge of corporate earnings reports this week.

After raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July, the Fed could be at or near the end of its rate hiking plans. It doesn't meet again about interest rates until September, and futures traders are not unanimous on when or whether another rate hike could come. Some see rates rising another quarter of a percentage point in September, some see it in November.

Fed officials meet later this month for their annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where top policy makers could provide some details on where they see the economy headed in the second half of the year.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Apple earnings

Tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.19 on revenue of $81.7 billion. Analysts will be listening for any details on new product launches and what is down the road.

“For a fee of $200 to $400, sellers can pay for services such as ‘Amazon Magic,’ as one broker on encrypted messaging service Telegram calls it,” according to the report.

The offerings include access to company insiders who can remove negative reviews on a product and provide information on competitors.

“Users are told to send a private message to learn the price of certain services,” the report noted.

The brokers act as middlemen between sellers and Amazon employees, who leak the data in exchange for money.

“Much more you can find about your account by ordering screenshots with inside information from us, as seller support sees it,” read a message in a Telegram group.

Helping third-party sellers recover their accounts has turned into a large and lucrative enterprise worldwide. Not just Telegram, other brokers peddle similar services on Telegram as well as on WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook groups.

“The confidential data is promoted as intelligence for any seller working to get their product or account reinstated,” the report claimed.

The issue of rogue employees taking bribes is not new for Amazon.

“The company has in the past dealt with low-level, low-wage seller support staffers in China, India and Costa Rica who have accepted payments in exchange for leaking information,” said the report.

The e-commerce giant said in a statement that there is no place for fraud at Amazon and “we will continue to pursue all measures to protect our store and hold bad actors accountable”.

This kind of dealing, however, is not new and a 2018 report from The Wall Street Journal had claimed that some Amazon employees accepted bribes to get access to internal sales data.

More recently, the US Department of Justice charged six individuals in 2020 with participating in a scheme to bribe employees and contractors for internal data.

Amazon had said that it uncovered the suspicious behaviour related to the bribery case in 2018 and reported it to the FBI.

It's the busiest week of earnings, with reports due out later from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) among big tech names. Pharmaceutical giants Merck (NS: ) & Company Inc (NYSE: )and Pfizer (NYSE: ) reported mixed results on Tuesday.

But investors are keenly focused on Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 200,000 jobs, slightly cooling from the prior month, while unemployment is expected to remain at record-lows near 3.6%. The Federal Reserve is looking for signs that the tight labor market has shown some softening without sparking big job losses as it tries to balance its fight against inflation with its efforts to guide the economy to a soft landing.

The Fed doesn't meet to decide on interest rates again until September. Futures traders see the probability of the Fed remaining at current rate levels when it does meet then, while some see a 30% probability of it raising rates another quarter of a point in November.

The idea that the Fed could be at the end of its rate hikes is lifting tech stocks, pulling the higher by 37% so far this year.

The last time the S&P 500 was on a winning streak this long was in 2021, when it was positive for seven months in a row — until August hit and ended the victory run.

The well-known Wall Street adage says “sell in May and go away”, because the summer, and August in particular, marks a historically volatile period for the stock market. That’s largely because so many investors take vacations and there are decreased trading volumes. This reduced activity can lead to increased volatility.

On average, August has been the worst performing month for stocks since 1986, according to Morningstar, CNN reported.

And this August may be choppier than usual because it’s particularly busy for late summer. It’s chock full of economic data, a key conference and big corporate reports. That means the dwindling number of traders who remain must take extra care in a such a potentially volatile environment.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) both report this week, and all eyes will be on these tech titans for clues about the mood among US consumers.

“This week’s Apple earnings report is critical for markets, as Apple is not only the market’s most valuable company, it’s also a litmus test for consumer spending, which so far has been keeping the economy afloat. But we have been seeing some signs of a consumer slowdown,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management on Monday.

With a valuation of $3 trillion, Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company, and its report could easily swing the direction of the markets, CNN reported.

2022-08-01, Investing.com,Amazon Launches AWS Infrastructure Region in Israel,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-launches-aws-infrastructure-region-in-israel-432SI-3749040,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) (AMZN), today announced the launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region. Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, have an even greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from data centers located in Israel, using advanced AWS technologies to drive innovation. AWS also released an economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $7.2 billion (approximately ILS 26.6 billion) in Israel through 2037 via the new AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure.

“The launch of the AWS Region in Israel provides customers with the ability to build the most advanced cloud technology-based applications and achieve the highest levels of security, availability, and resilience,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “Israel’s strategy to promote technology innovation, along with its abundance of talent, has created a thriving global hub for entrepreneurs, e-governments, and multinational businesses. Cloud technology is at the heart of any digital transformation program, and AWS is proud to support Israel’s efforts to enhance citizen services for many years to come.”

In 2021, the government of Israel announced its selection of AWS as its primary cloud provider as part of the Nimbus contract for government ministries and subsidiaries. The Nimbus framework provides cloud services to Israeli government ministries—including local municipalities, government-owned companies, and public sector organizations—with the aim of driving innovation and enabling new digital services for the citizens of Israel.

“We are excited to welcome the new AWS Region to Israel as part of project Nimbus and we congratulate AWS for its commitment and hard work in building the Israeli Region,” said Yali Rothenberg, accountant general of Israel. “The establishment of the Israeli Region reflects the long-term commitment of AWS to Israel and to the continuation of their large investments in the Israeli market. The establishment of the Region will enable us to migrate substantial governmental workloads to the cloud, and we are confident that it will help us accelerate digital transformation in the public sector, leverage technology to drive innovation in the government, improve customer experience, and further the development of the technological ecosystem in Israel.”

With the launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, AWS has 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. The AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region consists of three Availability Zones, each located far enough from the other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.

The launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region enables customers to securely store data in Israel while providing customers with even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI).

AWS released an economic impact study estimating the company’s projected spend on the construction and operation of the new AWS Region, which will support an average of more than 7,700 full-time equivalent jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned $7.2 billion (approx. ILS 26.6 billion) investment in Israel through 2037. The construction and operation of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region is also estimated to add approximately $13.9 billion (ILS 51.7 billion) to Israel’s gross domestic product (GDP) through 2037.

Customers and AWS Partners welcome the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region

Israeli organizations are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. Large and small enterprises in Israel choose AWS to innovate, drive cost efficiencies, and accelerate time to market. Customers in Israel using AWS include Amdocs, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Harel Insurance, ICL Group, Ituran, Migdal, Netafim, Paz, Phoenix, and Tnuva. Public sector organizations that use AWS to transform the services delivered to Israeli citizens include Ayalon Highway, Government of Israel, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and Road Safety, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, the Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority, and Weizmann Institute. Israeli startups, including Aidoc, AI21 Labs, AppsFlyer, Armis, CyberArk, Gong, Jfrog, Logz.io, Monday.com, SentinelOne, TytoCare, Wix, and Wiz, are building their businesses with the use of AWS to rapidly scale nationally and around the world.

Aidoc is a pioneering force in clinical AI. The company aids and empowers health care teams to optimize patient treatment resulting in improved economic value and clinical outcomes. Aidoc’s exclusive aiOS analyzes all types of medical data, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, medical records, and more, to flag acute abnormalities, prioritize life-threatening cases, and expedite patient treatment to improve the quality of care. “Our utilization of AWS infrastructure and services has been pivotal in driving our operational agility and development velocity. What truly sets AWS apart is the constant access to cutting-edge computing technologies, amplifying the effectiveness of our model training,” said Guy Reiner, vice president of Research and Development at Aidoc. “With the new AWS Region, health care providers can now achieve a milestone in data privacy within hospitals and care facilities. AWS’s unwavering commitment to offering HIPAA-eligible services locally, along with its wide array of features and services to support General Data Protection Regulation requirements in cloud environments, instills our unwavering trust.”

Founded in 1921, Bank Hapoalim is one of the largest financial institutions in Israel and offers a broad range of banking and financial services to millions of customers in the country. “AWS enables us to speed up innovation and quickly bring new products and capabilities—such as our FinTech Zone business platform—to market,” said Eti Ben-Zeev, head of Information Technology, chief information officer, and deputy CEO at Bank Hapoalim. “FinTech Zone makes it possible for fintech startups to work together with the bank efficiently and securely, leveraging the benefits of AWS to bring new offerings to the market faster. The new AWS Region will make it easier for us to offer innovative solutions to our customers while continuing to accelerate our digital transformation and meet the strictest regulatory requirements.”

The Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority is an independent government agency that is responsible for ensuring legal compliance and consumer rights. The Authority established a new national “Do Not Call” database that is aimed at curbing the problem of unwanted marketing calls in Israel. “The ‘Do Not Call’ database project was a technical challenge that required us to develop a service that was secure, accessible, and simple to use for all users,” said Peleg Shafir, chief technology officer at the Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority. “AWS helped us create a scalable solution that meets the needs of every citizen, regardless of their language or digital literacy. With the opening of the AWS Region in Israel, we will have even more possibilities to provide our users with the fastest access to our services and an exceptional digital experience.”

The Ministry of Transport and Road Safety is responsible for the planning, development, and regulation of infrastructure and integrated transport systems in Israel. “Public Transportation has moved to AWS to increase efficiencies in the collection, management, research, and processing of public transportation data in Israel,” said Ortal Niv, chief information officer at the Ministry of Transportation and Road Safety. “We use AI services to accelerate information processing, provide accurate prediction of transportation needs, improve traffic management capabilities, and help reduce traffic jams. The new AWS Region will also allow us to securely deploy new applications, increase efficiencies, improve performance, and meet data residency requirements.”

Cloud security leader Wiz is a pioneer in the rising Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) security market. “Our customers, which include 35% of the Fortune 500, rely on Wiz to help create secure cloud environments that accelerate their business by scanning 230 billion files daily on five million protected cloud workloads,” said Roy Reznik, co-founder and vice president of Research and Development at Wiz. “Building on AWS has helped our business scale during hyper growth and allowed us to maintain high levels of service to our customers, regardless of their location. The new AWS Region in Israel will allow us to replicate our development environments locally, delivering faster product iterations and reducing time to market, and now, we will be able to offer our solutions to local data-sensitive customers, enabling them to consolidate their cloud security programs to a single platform.”

The AWS Partner Network (APN) includes tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world. AWS Partners build innovative solutions and services on AWS, and the APN helps by providing business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support to customers.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: ) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK: ) (NYSE: ), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK: ), and Baidu Inc (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) kept the index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK: ) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The index logged small gains, while Japan’s rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

2022-07-31, Investing.com,The 'A' word and these 2 other factors can unlock Amazon shares - Evercore ISI,https://in.investing.com/news/the-a-word-and-these-2-other-factors-can-unlock-amazon-shares--evercore-isi-3747799,"Ahead of its earnings on Thursday of this week, Evercore ISI analysts are listing three factors that could unlock value in Amazon (NASDAQ: ), including the ""A-word.""

First, as Amazon compares against the substantial cost spikes experienced in 2022, there will be a rebound in retail margins. This recovery will be facilitated by the restoration of capacity utilization and the implementation of newfound efficiencies resulting from regionalization in Amazon's retail operations. They anticipate observing tangible evidence of this development in the Q2 report.

The second aspect is tied to a recovery in retail sales. This resurgence is partially supported by recent indicative data on retail sales. Additionally, the firm's ""Shipping Elasticity"" analysis suggests that faster shipping leads to quicker shopping, further contributing to the potential recovery. They anticipate the Q2 report might present evidence supporting this hypothesis.

The third factor to consider is the acceleration of AWS revenue growth. This, according to the analysts, is the ""A-word"". Brian Olsavsky, the CFO, will be closely followed for an utterance of the ""A-word."" Both the firm and the market anticipate a year-over-year AWS revenue growth of 9%-11% in Q2. They believe that the pace revealed for July will likely align with Q2's growth. The crucial question lies in whether management hints at AWS experiencing revenue growth acceleration starting from Q3, driven by the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comparisons. As of now, this remains uncertain, but if it happens, it would be a significant milestone for the company."

Apple, Amazon dominate earnings slate

While sentiment remains fragile, the focus Thursday is likely to be on Apple, the largest company in the world according to market capitalization, and online retail behemoth Amazon as they are scheduled to announce their quarterly earnings, in what has already been a busy week of corporate results.

Apple is likely to report a third straight quarter of declining revenue, with details about its current quarter, which ends in September, likely to be in focus. Investors may also be interested if the iPhone maker has any plans to integrate artificial intelligence into its operations.

At Amazon, the group's key cloud computing division will be in the spotlight, with the retail giant having previously flagged that a deceleration in growth in the prior quarter at the unit, Amazon Web Services, continued into April.

Other results are due from the likes of brewing giant Anheuser Busch Inbev (EBR: ), housing letting company Airbnb (NASDAQ: ), online travel agency Expedia (NASDAQ: ), mobile payments company Block (NYSE: )and insurer Cigna (NYSE: ).

2022-08-03, Investing.com,"Apple and Amazon to report, Adidas narrows loss forecast - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-and-amazon-to-report-adidas-narrows-loss-forecast--whats-moving-markets-3753598,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures slip, suggesting an extension in declines on Wall Street seen in the prior session, as traders continued to gauge the implications of Fitch's downgrade of America's credit rating earlier this week. Elsewhere, investors gear up for the release of quarterly results from tech giants Apple and Amazon, while Adidas sees a smaller 2022 loss thanks to strong sales of its leftover stock of Yeezy shoes.

1. Futures edge lower after sell-off

U.S. stock futures pointed into the red Thursday, a day after a U.S. credit rating downgrade by ratings agency Fitch sparked a sell-off on Wall Street.

At 05:18 ET (09:18 GMT), the contract lost 85 points or 0.24%, shed 12 points or 0.28%, and dipped by 55 points or 0.36%.

The benchmark posted its biggest drop since April in the prior session, while the tech-heavy slumped to its worst day since February.

Fitch lowered the U.S.'s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to AA+ from the top-most level of AAA on Tuesday, citing worries around the country's fiscal position and governance standards. The announcements cooled a series of recent gains for stocks.

Attention will likely now turn back to this week's flurry of corporate earnings, with tech giants Amazon and Apple set to report their latest quarterly results after the closing bell.

On the economic calendar, investors will have a chance to parse through weekly data, which will serve as a prelude to the release of the all-important for July on Friday.

2. Qualcomm's sales forecast disappoints

Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) has unveiled sales guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter that missed expectations and announced plans to slash jobs as recent weakness in the smartphone market failed to ease.

The U.S. chip designer said it now expects revenue in the current three-month period to come in between $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion. Analysts had seen the figure at $8.70B.

A slump in end-user demand for handsets, along with many smartphone makers choosing to use existing chip supplies to manufacture their devices, both factored into the outlook, the company noted. The smartphone market has faced headwinds as inflation-conscious customers rein in spending on non-essential items and replacement cycles lengthen. According to research firm Canalys, global smartphone shipments dropped by 13% in the first quarter of 2022.

Adding to these underlying issues, the San Diego-based business said it now does not foresee ""any material revenue"" from Huawei because it does not have a license to sell 5G chips to the Chinese telecom group. Qualcomm also flagged that it would likely be hit with ""significant"" restructuring charges linked to workforce reductions.

Shares in the firm fell sharply in premarket U.S. trading.

3. Apple and Amazon ahead

Major tech sector bellwether Apple (NASDAQ: ) and e-commerce behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are scheduled to announce their quarterly earnings Thursday, in two of the most closely-watched releases in what has been a busy week of corporate results.

For Apple, analysts mostly expect the California-based iPhone maker to report a third straight quarter of declining revenue. The focus will likely be on any details the company may choose to give about its current quarter, which ends in September.

Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, which typically includes new smartphone releases and back-to-school laptop purchases, can be a signpost for the company's performance heading into the critical holiday season. But the period may have even greater influence this year, as it could provide clues into whether the U.S. economy can avoid a broader meltdown after a string of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

At Amazon, the group's key cloud computing division will be in the spotlight.

Bellevue, Washington-based Amazon previously flagged that a deceleration in growth in the prior quarter at the unit, Amazon Web Services, continued into April. The slowdown may be reflective of a broader weakness in cloud spending as inflationary pressures persuade clients and individuals to pull back on some tech expenditures.

Meanwhile, as it was with their Big Tech peers last week, executives at both Apple and Amazon may also field questions from analysts about their plans to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations.

4. Adidas sees smaller 2022 loss after Yeezy destocking

Adidas (ETR: ) has narrowed its projected 2022 loss thanks to strong demand for the leftover stock of its Yeezy shoe brand, the German sports apparel group said on Thursday.

The company had halted sales of the sneaker after it cut ties with designer Ye last year following antisemitic remarks made by the rapper formerly known as Kanye West.

In order to avoid a deep write-down on its remaining stock of Yeezy-branded products, Adidas announced in May that it would sell some of this inventory and donate the proceeds to different charities that fight antisemitism and racism.

In the second quarter, these sales generated around €400 million (€1 = $1.0926), leading Adidas to reduce its expected annual loss to €450M, down from its prior guidance for a loss of €700M. Adidas also earmarked €110M for charitable donations.

Analysts cited by Reuters said that a second batch of Yeezy stock sales will likely attract solid demand as well, albeit not as profitable as the initial release. Adidas noted that its full-year outlook does not include the impact of another Yeezy stock drop.

5. Oil retreats amid signs of tightening supplies, Fitch downgrade

Oil prices fell Thursday on worries about the global economic outlook, even after a record drop in U.S. inventories indicated a substantial tightening in crude markets.

Official data, released Wednesday, showed that U.S. crude inventories shrank by over 17 million barrels in the week to July 28 - the biggest drop recorded in data stretching back to 1982.

The Fitch downgrade of the U.S. credit rating also dented risk appetite for a second consecutive day, weighing on oil prices. In the prior session, crude fell from more than three-month highs in the wake of the ratings agency's announcement.

By 05:11 ET, futures traded 0.18% lower at $79.35 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.24% to $83.00."

Graphics chip major Nvidia gained over 50 per cent in market cap in Q2 and almost 200 per cent since January.

“Nvidia continued to spearhead the surge. The company, which witnessed over 90 per cent increase in market value in Q1 2022, had another impressive quarter, recording a 52 per cent increase in market value in Q2 2022,” said Gracio Benher, business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.

Other companies, which had seen impressive gains in stock values in Q2 2022 include Meta (NASDAQ: ) (33.8 per cent), Oracle (NYSE: ) (28.9 per cent), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26.4 per cent). They recorded overall gains of 130 per cent, 45 per cent and 56.1 per cent, respectively, since the beginning of 2022.

The prediction of a global recession and the Federal Reserve (Fed) interest-rate induced spending squeeze saw tech stocks experiencing a tipsy-topsy journey during most part of H1 2022.

However, it did not deter the top companies gain record valuation.

Meta has gained the approval of investors, after the company’s efficiency initiatives showed positive impact on the latest quarter results, with other factors being improved monetisation from reels content and enhanced ad targeting.

At the other extreme, Tencent, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and Cisco (NASDAQ: ) witnessed their market value eroding during Q2 2022, said the report.

Tencent, which saw its market value recovering in Q1 2022, slipped back to Q4 2022 level by the end of Q2 2022, impacted by a slowdown in Chinese economy, heavy sell-off by Prosus, one of its major stakeholders, and fear among investor community about potential sanctions that restrict exporting of select chips into China.

Weak demand for smartphones and tablets impacted Qualcomm’s top-line performance in recent quarters, impacting its market value.

“Looking ahead, tech companies offering hardware and software solutions for AI tools and cloud-based solutions are likely to witness market rally for their stocks,” said Benher.

2022-08-03, Investing.com,Asian stocks fall as risk-off persists after U.S. rating cut,https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-fall-as-riskoff-persists-after-us-rating-cut-3753041,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks fell on Thursday, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street after Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating somewhat dented sentiment, while strong payrolls data also pushed up concerns over rising interest rates.

Fitch had earlier this week downgraded its rating for the U.S. government to AA+ from AAA, citing concerns over fiscal spending and increased clashes between the Democrats and Republicans.

While analysts downplayed the direct impact of the downgrade, the move still triggered a wave of selling across global stock markets, as investors locked in profits after a strong run through June and July.

Technology stocks see extended profit taking, strong payrolls data weighs

Tech stocks, which had seen strong gains over the past two months, bore the brunt of selling pressure, with South Korea’s and Hong Kong’s index falling 0.8% and 0.6%, respectively.

Stocks were also rattled by stronger-than-expected U.S. data on Wednesday, which boosted the dollar and Treasury yields as markets positioned for a similar reading from official data due on Friday.

Resilience in the U.S. economy - particularly in the labor market - gives the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep raising interest rates, which bodes poorly for risk-driven stock markets.

Tech stockholders were also on edge ahead of earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).

Broader Asian markets retreated. Japanese stocks were among the worst performers for the day, with the index sliding 1.6%, while the broader fell 1.2%. Local stocks were hit by a mix of profit taking, as well as uncertainty over the Bank of Japan’s stance on its ultra-dovish monetary policy.

Australia’s fell 0.5% as data showed that the country’s remained steady in June. Australian also fell less than expected in the second quarter.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a slightly positive open, after the index plummeted from record highs this week. High weightage of technology stocks weighed heavily on the Nifty and the in recent sessions.

Chinese stocks limit losses as PMI data signals some strength

China’s and indexes fell less than their peers on Thursday, as a showed that the country’s services sector grew more than expected in July.

The reading indicated that steady retail spending and services demand was still keeping some facets of Chinese business activity afloat, and could help support a bigger economic recovery this year, especially if the government rolls out more stimulus measures.

Tech stocks have been rallying all year on the prospect of easing conditions for interest rates. Fitch downgraded the U.S. on Tuesday night, citing increased polarity in Washington over debt ceiling and other negotiations that point to a deterioration in governance standards. The Treasury Department pushed back at the firm's assertions.

Still, it was enough to weigh on markets amid a deluge of corporate earnings reports this week.

After raising interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in July, the Fed could be at or near the end of its rate hiking plans. It doesn't meet again about interest rates until September, and futures traders are not unanimous on when or whether another rate hike could come. Some see rates rising another quarter of a percentage point in September, some see it in November.

Fed officials meet later this month for their annual conference at Jackson Hole, Wyo., where top policy makers could provide some details on where they see the economy headed in the second half of the year.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Apple earnings

Tech giant Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $1.19 on revenue of $81.7 billion. Analysts will be listening for any details on new product launches and what is down the road.

“For a fee of $200 to $400, sellers can pay for services such as ‘Amazon Magic,’ as one broker on encrypted messaging service Telegram calls it,” according to the report.

The offerings include access to company insiders who can remove negative reviews on a product and provide information on competitors.

“Users are told to send a private message to learn the price of certain services,” the report noted.

The brokers act as middlemen between sellers and Amazon employees, who leak the data in exchange for money.

“Much more you can find about your account by ordering screenshots with inside information from us, as seller support sees it,” read a message in a Telegram group.

Helping third-party sellers recover their accounts has turned into a large and lucrative enterprise worldwide. Not just Telegram, other brokers peddle similar services on Telegram as well as on WeChat, WhatsApp and Facebook groups.

“The confidential data is promoted as intelligence for any seller working to get their product or account reinstated,” the report claimed.

The issue of rogue employees taking bribes is not new for Amazon.

“The company has in the past dealt with low-level, low-wage seller support staffers in China, India and Costa Rica who have accepted payments in exchange for leaking information,” said the report.

The e-commerce giant said in a statement that there is no place for fraud at Amazon and “we will continue to pursue all measures to protect our store and hold bad actors accountable”.

This kind of dealing, however, is not new and a 2018 report from The Wall Street Journal had claimed that some Amazon employees accepted bribes to get access to internal sales data.

More recently, the US Department of Justice charged six individuals in 2020 with participating in a scheme to bribe employees and contractors for internal data.

Amazon had said that it uncovered the suspicious behaviour related to the bribery case in 2018 and reported it to the FBI.

It's the busiest week of earnings, with reports due out later from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) among big tech names. Pharmaceutical giants Merck (NS: ) & Company Inc (NYSE: )and Pfizer (NYSE: ) reported mixed results on Tuesday.

But investors are keenly focused on Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 200,000 jobs, slightly cooling from the prior month, while unemployment is expected to remain at record-lows near 3.6%. The Federal Reserve is looking for signs that the tight labor market has shown some softening without sparking big job losses as it tries to balance its fight against inflation with its efforts to guide the economy to a soft landing.

The Fed doesn't meet to decide on interest rates again until September. Futures traders see the probability of the Fed remaining at current rate levels when it does meet then, while some see a 30% probability of it raising rates another quarter of a point in November.

The idea that the Fed could be at the end of its rate hikes is lifting tech stocks, pulling the higher by 37% so far this year.

The last time the S&P 500 was on a winning streak this long was in 2021, when it was positive for seven months in a row — until August hit and ended the victory run.

The well-known Wall Street adage says “sell in May and go away”, because the summer, and August in particular, marks a historically volatile period for the stock market. That’s largely because so many investors take vacations and there are decreased trading volumes. This reduced activity can lead to increased volatility.

On average, August has been the worst performing month for stocks since 1986, according to Morningstar, CNN reported.

And this August may be choppier than usual because it’s particularly busy for late summer. It’s chock full of economic data, a key conference and big corporate reports. That means the dwindling number of traders who remain must take extra care in a such a potentially volatile environment.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) both report this week, and all eyes will be on these tech titans for clues about the mood among US consumers.

“This week’s Apple earnings report is critical for markets, as Apple is not only the market’s most valuable company, it’s also a litmus test for consumer spending, which so far has been keeping the economy afloat. But we have been seeing some signs of a consumer slowdown,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management on Monday.

With a valuation of $3 trillion, Apple is the most valuable publicly traded company, and its report could easily swing the direction of the markets, CNN reported.

2022-08-01, Investing.com,Amazon Launches AWS Infrastructure Region in Israel,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-launches-aws-infrastructure-region-in-israel-432SI-3749040,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) (AMZN), today announced the launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region. Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, have an even greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from data centers located in Israel, using advanced AWS technologies to drive innovation. AWS also released an economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $7.2 billion (approximately ILS 26.6 billion) in Israel through 2037 via the new AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure.

“The launch of the AWS Region in Israel provides customers with the ability to build the most advanced cloud technology-based applications and achieve the highest levels of security, availability, and resilience,” said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. “Israel’s strategy to promote technology innovation, along with its abundance of talent, has created a thriving global hub for entrepreneurs, e-governments, and multinational businesses. Cloud technology is at the heart of any digital transformation program, and AWS is proud to support Israel’s efforts to enhance citizen services for many years to come.”

In 2021, the government of Israel announced its selection of AWS as its primary cloud provider as part of the Nimbus contract for government ministries and subsidiaries. The Nimbus framework provides cloud services to Israeli government ministries—including local municipalities, government-owned companies, and public sector organizations—with the aim of driving innovation and enabling new digital services for the citizens of Israel.

“We are excited to welcome the new AWS Region to Israel as part of project Nimbus and we congratulate AWS for its commitment and hard work in building the Israeli Region,” said Yali Rothenberg, accountant general of Israel. “The establishment of the Israeli Region reflects the long-term commitment of AWS to Israel and to the continuation of their large investments in the Israeli market. The establishment of the Region will enable us to migrate substantial governmental workloads to the cloud, and we are confident that it will help us accelerate digital transformation in the public sector, leverage technology to drive innovation in the government, improve customer experience, and further the development of the technological ecosystem in Israel.”

With the launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region, AWS has 102 Availability Zones across 32 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Canada, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Thailand. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. The AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region consists of three Availability Zones, each located far enough from the other to support customers’ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.

The launch of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region enables customers to securely store data in Israel while providing customers with even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI).

AWS released an economic impact study estimating the company’s projected spend on the construction and operation of the new AWS Region, which will support an average of more than 7,700 full-time equivalent jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned $7.2 billion (approx. ILS 26.6 billion) investment in Israel through 2037. The construction and operation of the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region is also estimated to add approximately $13.9 billion (ILS 51.7 billion) to Israel’s gross domestic product (GDP) through 2037.

Customers and AWS Partners welcome the AWS Israel (Tel Aviv) Region

Israeli organizations are among the millions of active customers using AWS in more than 190 countries around the world. Large and small enterprises in Israel choose AWS to innovate, drive cost efficiencies, and accelerate time to market. Customers in Israel using AWS include Amdocs, Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Harel Insurance, ICL Group, Ituran, Migdal, Netafim, Paz, Phoenix, and Tnuva. Public sector organizations that use AWS to transform the services delivered to Israeli citizens include Ayalon Highway, Government of Israel, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport and Road Safety, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, the Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority, and Weizmann Institute.

Aidoc is a pioneering force in clinical AI. The company aids and empowers health care teams to optimize patient treatment resulting in improved economic value and clinical outcomes. Aidoc’s exclusive aiOS analyzes all types of medical data, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, medical records, and more, to flag acute abnormalities, prioritize life-threatening cases, and expedite patient treatment to improve the quality of care. “Our utilization of AWS infrastructure and services has been pivotal in driving our operational agility and development velocity. What truly sets AWS apart is the constant access to cutting-edge computing technologies, amplifying the effectiveness of our model training,” said Guy Reiner, vice president of Research and Development at Aidoc. “With the new AWS Region, health care providers can now achieve a milestone in data privacy within hospitals and care facilities. AWS’s unwavering commitment to offering HIPAA-eligible services locally, along with its wide array of features and services to support General Data Protection Regulation requirements in cloud environments, instills our unwavering trust.”

The new AWS Region will make it easier for us to offer innovative solutions to our customers while continuing to accelerate our digital transformation and meet the strictest regulatory requirements.”

The Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority is an independent government agency that is responsible for ensuring legal compliance and consumer rights. The Authority established a new national “Do Not Call” database that is aimed at curbing the problem of unwanted marketing calls in Israel. “The ‘Do Not Call’ database project was a technical challenge that required us to develop a service that was secure, accessible, and simple to use for all users,” said Peleg Shafir, chief technology officer at the Consumer Protection and Fair Trade Authority. “AWS helped us create a scalable solution that meets the needs of every citizen, regardless of their language or digital literacy. With the opening of the AWS Region in Israel, we will have even more possibilities to provide our users with the fastest access to our services and an exceptional digital experience.”

The Ministry of Transport and Road Safety is responsible for the planning, development, and regulation of infrastructure and integrated transport systems in Israel. “Public Transportation has moved to AWS to increase efficiencies in the collection, management, research, and processing of public transportation data in Israel,” said Ortal Niv, chief information officer at the Ministry of Transportation and Road Safety. “We use AI services to accelerate information processing, provide accurate prediction of transportation needs, improve traffic management capabilities, and help reduce traffic jams. The new AWS Region will also allow us to securely deploy new applications, increase efficiencies, improve performance, and meet data residency requirements.”

Cloud security leader Wiz is a pioneer in the rising Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) security market. “Our customers, which include 35% of the Fortune 500, rely on Wiz to help create secure cloud environments that accelerate their business by scanning 230 billion files daily on five million protected cloud workloads,” said Roy Reznik, co-founder and vice president of Research and Development at Wiz. “Building on AWS has helped our business scale during hyper growth and allowed us to maintain high levels of service to our customers, regardless of their location. The new AWS Region in Israel will allow us to replicate our development environments locally, delivering faster product iterations and reducing time to market, and now, we will be able to offer our solutions to local data-sensitive customers, enabling them to consolidate their cloud security programs to a single platform.”

The AWS Partner Network (APN) includes tens of thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and systems integrators (SIs) around the world. AWS Partners build innovative solutions and services on AWS, and the APN helps by providing business, technical, marketing, and go-to-market support to customers.

2022-08-01, Investing.com,"Asian stocks push higher on tech strength, China lags",https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-push-higher-on-tech-strength-china-lags-3748643,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks rose on Tuesday, buoyed by strength in technology stocks as markets awaited major U.S. earnings this week, although Chinese markets lagged on more weak economic signals.

Regional markets took positive cues from a strong overnight finish on Wall Street, although focus remained chiefly on upcoming earnings reports from Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). But strong results from tech heavyweights Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) last week set a positive tone for the upcoming earnings.

Optimism over improving global economic prospects - amid easing inflation and resilient growth in major economies - also spurred flows into risk-heavy stocks.

Tech-heavy indexes lead gains

South Korea’s was the best performer for the day, up over 1% on strength in heavyweight chipmaking stocks. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS: ) rose 1.2% after U.S. memory chip making peer Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: ) said that the worst for the industry was over, even as the firm forecast a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and revenue drop.

Strength in internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (HK: ) (NYSE: ), Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK: ), and Baidu Inc (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) kept the index in positive territory, even as other sectors on the index logged steep losses. Property developer Country Garden (HK: ) slid over 5% after it scrapped a $300 million capital raise.

The index logged small gains, while Japan’s rose 0.6% on strong automobile and tech stocks.

Sentiment towards Japanese stocks was also aided by emergency bond buying by the Bank of Japan, which pushed up bets that the bank was in no hurry to tighten policy immediately.

Futures for India’s index pointed to a flat open, although both indexes were close to hitting record highs on strength in heavyweight tech stocks.

Still, gains in most markets were limited as investors remained wary of key U.S. data this week. Mixed economic cues from China also dented sentiment.

Australia’s rose 0.3% ahead of a closely-watched decision later in the day. Markets are split over whether the bank will hike rates further.

Chinese stocks lag on weak PMIs, stimulus in focus

China’s index rose just 0.1%, while the fell slightly as a showed on Tuesday that the country’s manufacturing sector unexpectedly shrank in July.

The reading follows a for July, and shows that China’s biggest economic engines are seeing little signs of recovery this year.

First, as Amazon compares against the substantial cost spikes experienced in 2022, there will be a rebound in retail margins. This recovery will be facilitated by the restoration of capacity utilization and the implementation of newfound efficiencies resulting from regionalization in Amazon's retail operations. They anticipate observing tangible evidence of this development in the Q2 report.

The second aspect is tied to a recovery in retail sales. This resurgence is partially supported by recent indicative data on retail sales. Additionally, the firm's ""Shipping Elasticity"" analysis suggests that faster shipping leads to quicker shopping, further contributing to the potential recovery. They anticipate the Q2 report might present evidence supporting this hypothesis.

The third factor to consider is the acceleration of AWS revenue growth. This, according to the analysts, is the ""A-word"". Brian Olsavsky, the CFO, will be closely followed for an utterance of the ""A-word."" Both the firm and the market anticipate a year-over-year AWS revenue growth of 9%-11% in Q2. They believe that the pace revealed for July will likely align with Q2's growth. The crucial question lies in whether management hints at AWS experiencing revenue growth acceleration starting from Q3, driven by the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comparisons. As of now, this remains uncertain, but if it happens, it would be a significant milestone for the company."

“The current setup is fairly similar to last quarter, where the combination of a low hurdle rate, along with the improving fundamentals, eventually led to meaningful beats. Q2 EPS projections for S&P 500 were cut significantly ahead of the reporting season, and most macro data showed a sequential improvement versus Q1,” JPMorgan analysts wrote recently.

The blended earnings decline so far for the second quarter is 7.3%, worse than the expected decline of 7%. For Q3 2022, 27 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 18 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance, FactSet data shows.

“For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 0.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -20.8%,” analysts at FactSet wrote.

Citi analysts are increasingly bullish on the S&P 500’s earnings potential for 2024, hence they raised the 2022 year-end price target to 4600 and the mid-2024 target to 5000.

“These new targets will be perceived as chasing the year-to-date move in the S&P 500. However, they better reflect an evolving macro and fundamental backdrop,” they said.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPM: “We were OW Value vs Growth style in 2022, through longs in Commodities and in Financials, against an UW Tech, but have reversed that view for this year, partly driven by the above call from last October that US yields have peaked. We think that the OW Growth vs Value style should stay relevant through the rest of 2022.”

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"

Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

Cindy Smith of Virginia state in the US said she never ordered those from Amazon.

""It's a lot of packages. I didn't order them and they kept coming from everybody,"" she told WUSA.

Smith drove around the town, giving packages to those who would just take them.

""A lot of people told me I was weird. I would drive around with headlamps and glue guns in the car. I gave them to everybody I met,"" she was quoted as saying.

""All my neighbours got glue guns or headlamps. I gave them to dog shelters, to veterinary clinics,"" she added.

These packages were addressed to someone called Lixiao Zhang.

According to reports, the incident is more likely linked to a different kind of vendor scheme, one that involves sellers trying to remove unsold merchandise from Amazon fulfillment centres. WUSA traced the returned packaging labels to 15 fulfillment centers in nine different US states.

Sellers in China who need to get their products out of Amazon warehouses pick random addresses and send their unwanted products there, he said, adding: ""It's just cheaper for them to do so.""

Karuna Shankar Pande, Director, Amazon Logistics, India said on the occasion, “We are thrilled to onboard India’s first floating ‘I Have Space’ store on Dal Lake, Srinagar. This will enable us to provide customers across Srinagar with reliable, efficient and faster deliveries. This also reaffirms our commitment to creating meaningful opportunities for individuals, and introducing new capabilities to empower our delivery network.""

Houseboat owner, Murtaza said, ""While I have a houseboat as my primary business, it only brings in seasonal income from tourists in Srinagar. However, the cost of managing the houseboat is very high, which has made it very difficult for our family. To address increasing expenses, I began looking for additional income opportunities. It was then that I came across Amazon’s ‘I Have Space’ program, which allows local store owners like me to supplement our regular income by delivering packages to Amazon customers.

""I saw this as the right fit for me to utilize my free time, use my shikara to deliver packages to Amazon customers and also earn additional income,” said Murtaza Khan Kashi.

Through its last-mile delivery program, 'I Have Space.' Amazon India partners with local stores and business owners to deliver products to customers within a 2 to 4 kilometers radius of their store, enabling them to earn additional income. Launched in 2015, the program has more than 28,000 neighborhood and kirana partners in close to 420 towns and cities across its network in India.

That has stirred quite a discussion around who's doing better?TECNO too caught the attention of the consumers when it dropped its latest teaser for the POVA 5 Pro 5G donning a multi-coloured LED light back panel and is set to give a tough competition to Nothing Phone (2).

Even though the light design resembles to the Nothing Phone, TECNO has an advantage over here as, unlike Nothing's single white LED light, POVA 5 Pro seems to support RGB colours at the back.

As per the teasers circulated on the internet, the brand has named light design as Arc interface and the same offers multiple functionalities with respect to incoming calls, music, and more.

2022-07-27, IANS,AWS launches AI-powered healthcare-focused services,https://in.investing.com/news/aws-launches-aipowered-healthcarefocused-services-3741677,"San Francisco, July 27 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) has introduced a wide range of healthcare-related applications and services that include generative artificial intelligence (AI) resources designed to assist clinicians in transcribing and evaluating their conversations with patients. The company launched AWS HealthScribe, a new HIPAA-eligible service empowering healthcare software vendors to build clinical applications that automatically generate preliminary clinical notes by analysing patient-clinician conversations.

With AWS HealthScribe, users can provide a robust suite of AI-powered features designed to accelerate clinical documentation in their clinical application, according to the company.

Healthcare application builders can integrate AWS HealthScribe in their clinical application to provide key highlights of the patient visit to the medical practitioner.

""By consolidating these capabilities, AWS HealthScribe reduces the need for training, optimising, and integrating separate AI services and building custom models, allowing for faster implementation. Customers can focus on delivering value to their end users without worrying about optimising individual AI components,"" AWS said in a blogpost on Wednesday.

Moreover, the company mentioned that 3M (NYSE: ) Health Information Systems (HIS), Babylon Health and ScribeEMR are among the companies already using HealthScribe. “Machine learning on AWS enables 3M HIS to transform clinician workflows and laborious processes to help health care organizations streamline clinical documentation and billing,” said Garri Garrison, President, 3M HIS.

AWS HealthScribe is available in preview in the US. Amazon has also announced AWS HealthImaging, a service designed to make it easier to store, transform, and analyse medical imaging data ""at a petabyte scale"".

Customers can use HealthImaging to run medical imaging apps from a single copy of each medical image in the AWS cloud.

2022-07-27, IANS,AstroTalk has democratised online astrology services in India: Founder,https://in.investing.com/news/astrotalk-has-democratised-online-astrology-services-in-india-founder-3741260,"New Delhi, July 27 (IANS) Post-pandemic, life was filled with uncertainty and millions of people were worried about their future, seeking simple solutions to their problems and looking at astrology to get the right direction. AstroTalk, which made astrology services more accessible via app and is the world's largest astrology platform, let users chat with trusted and verified astrologers through its app.

Its founder, Puneet Gupta, started AstroTalk in October 2017 and within a span of few years, it became the market leader.

Gupta told IANS that the platform has seen massive traction over the past few years and reached 40 million customers cumulatively, commanding over 80 per cent market share in the Indian online astrology market.

Here are excerpts from an interaction:

Q: Tell us more about AstroTalk and its vision.

A: Astrotalk was set up primarily to help customers seek answers and guidance from trusted and verified astrologers. We at Astrotalk believe in our ancient vedic science and believe that using these sciences, we can create a positive impact on the world and the lives of our millions of customers worldwide.

Astrotalk enables consultations between customers and astrologers through our secured platform across the medium of chat , voice telephony and live streaming. The platform is positioned as a one-stop solution for all astrology and wellness needs.

Q: How has been the response to AstroTalk so far?

A: We have seen massive traction over the past few years and have reached 40 million customers cumulatively. Going forward, we will be expanding a lot internationally so that the benefits of the platform can also accrue to the global Indian diaspora. We are very bullish on the Indian market and growth story and believe that with increasing premiumization, the market for a product like Astrotalk will only expand. We already command an over 80 per cent market share in the Indian online astrology market.

Q. How do you plan to leverage Analytics and AI/ML within Astrotalk?

A. We already leverage AI/ML to create predictive algorithms for fraud detection and astrological research. Improving developer productivity has also been one of the key goals for reducing our time to market and we have recently started exploring Generative AI offerings from AWS such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CodeWhisperer to plug any code vulnerabilities and accelerate time-consuming coding tasks.

We are also in progress of creating our own chatbot to answer support queries of the customers. With our growing platform demand, a lot of data is crunched on a real-time basis using AWS services such as RDS, S3, AWS DMS and other open-source technologies. However, we still believe that no amount of AI/ML can replace astrologer-user conversations and analysis of a true & verified astrologer.

Q: How has AWS Cloud helped you scale your growth?

A: Cloud telephony and AWS have helped us implement a truly robust scalable solution which has enabled us to scale faster. We have increased our revenues from Rs 5 crore/month in 2020 to Rs 45 crore/month now, while using AWS, hence spending less time on firefighting and optimizing infra and more time on growing the business.

One of the key challenges AstroTalk faced was the resource-intensive nature of their internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. AWS provided a robust solution by leveraging Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) flexibility to spawn multiple slaves, distributing the workload across them.

Additionally, using routing rules in Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), they directed CRM requests to a separate target group specifically designed for handling CRM traffic. This approach resulted in a remarkable improvement in CRM performance and significantly increased the speed of their operations teams. Metrics, such as reduced response times and improved customer satisfaction, demonstrated the effectiveness of these optimizations.

AWS offered cost-saving opportunities for Astrotalk through various services and strategies. By implementing Amazon EC2's automatic scaling groups (ASG), they were able to adapt their infrastructure dynamically to fluctuating traffic demands, thereby optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs during periods of low activity.

Moreover, they adopted gp3 disks for Amazon RDS, leading to a cost reduction of over 40 per cent compared to their previous storage solution. Additionally, they optimized storage costs by migrating call recordings from standard storage to intelligent tiering on Amazon S3, intelligently adjusting storage classes based on usage patterns.

Time to market is a critical factor in today's competitive business landscape. AWS provided Astrotalk. with the tools they needed to accelerate their software deployment process. By utilizing AWS CodeDeploy in conjunction with automatic scaling, they established a blue-green deployment pipeline. This approach allowed us to gradually roll out updates and quickly revert to previous versions in case of any bugs or issues, providing greater confidence to the development team during deployments.

Astrotalk capitalised on AWS's Autoscaling Groups and Savings Plans. Autoscaling Groups allowed them to automatically adjust the number of instances based on workload fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning resources.

Astrotalk also leveraged AWS's Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service, distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances and Availability Zones (AZs) to prevent single points of failure.

2022-07-26, Investing.com,This Warren Buffett-backed stock could fall after reporting Q2 results - Morgan Stanley,https://in.investing.com/news/this-warren-buffettbacked-stock-could-fall-after-reporting-q2-results--morgan-stanley-432SI-3740190,"Morgan Stanley equity strategists highlighted 12 stocks that they believe will move higher/lower after reporting their results for the June quarter.

The Q2 earnings report could serve as positive catalysts for as many as 10 stocks, while 2 of them could fall given high expectations.

The strategists highlight “a lowered bar for Q2 earnings” given that the Q2 EPS estimates are down about 9% year-to-date and 16.5% from the 2022 peak.

“Expectations for 2Q earnings are still moving lower into the results season and are likely to set up a typical modest beat (the historical average is +5%). However, revisions ahead of the quarter have not been as steep as they have in past quarters, meaning the hurdle may not be quite as easy. The trend for the past three quarters has been a slight beat on the current quarter but then the out-quarter revises lower,” they said in a client note.

The market expectations from the Q2 earnings season are for 0% sales growth and -9% EPS decline.

“At the sector level, consensus expects the highest relative growth in 2Q from Discretionary and Comm. Services while Healthcare, Materials, and Energy are expected to see double-digit EPS declines,” they added.

Along these lines, they highlighted 12 names for which Morgan Stanley Research analysts expect a near-term catalyst that should drive a meaningful move in each stock.

The “positive list” includes tech giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), in addition to Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ), Five9 (NASDAQ: ), Flowserve (NYSE: ), Hess (NYSE: ), S&P Global (NYSE: ), Sunrun (NASDAQ: ), Wix (NASDAQ: ), and Yum! Brands (NYSE: ).

On the other hand, the upcoming Q2 earnings reports could act as a negative catalyst for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) and Warren Buffett-backed Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ).

Elaborating more on OXY, the strategists wrote:

“Our 2Q oil production estimate is below consensus, and our capex is above consensus. We expect lower cash flow in 2Q on lower realized prices Q/Q, outlay for preferred stock redemption accrued in 1Q, and investment in NET Power, reducing the capacity for share repurchases.”"

Citing four sources familiar with the situation, the publication said the commission has been investigating the company on several fronts, with the case potentially one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves by the Biden administration to reign in the power of tech giants.

Amazon shares are down over 1% premarket.

It is said that the lawsuit is expected as soon as August and will probably challenge various Amazon business practices.

Politico went as far as saying that, if successful, it could result in a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion powerhouse, defining the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

However, they noted that while they know the FTC has focused on several of Amazon's business practices, the exact details of the final lawsuit aren't known, and it is expected that there will be changes to the final complaint until the eleventh hour.

The publication said sources told them the complaint would focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon's rules that the FTC says obstruct lower prices on competing websites, and policies they believe force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services."

2022-07-26, IANS,FTC’s Lina Khan prepares huge lawsuit to ‘break up’ Amazon,https://in.investing.com/news/ftcs-lina-khan-prepares-huge-lawsuit-to-break-up-amazon-3739532,"San Francisco, July 26 (IANS) The Lina Khan-led Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the US is reportedly finalising a massive antitrust lawsuit against Amazon (NASDAQ: ), a move that could break up parts of the e-commerce giant.According to a report in Politico, citing people close to the matter, the “wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices”.

The lawsuit might lead to a court-ordered “restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire”, the report noted.

The FTC has been investigating Amazon for a long time. Among the potential claims are allegations similar to existing cases like Amazon’s rules requiring third-party retailers to offer their lowest prices on its platform.

“The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services,” the report detailed, citing sources.

Both Amazon and the FTC declined to comment.

On Amazon Prime, the FTC is concerned that the “bundle of services is used to illegally cement the company’s market power”.

The FTC last month sued the e-commerce giant Amazon over alleged 'deceptive' tactics to sign up customers for its Prime service.

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

""Specifically, Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions,"" read the FTC complaint.

Amazon Prime costs $139 per year and gives consumers access to free two-day shipping, along with access to Prime Video and music streaming.

""Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,"" FTC Chair Khan had said in a statement.

""These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike. The FTC will continue to vigorously protect Americans from ""dark patterns"" and other unfair or deceptive practices in digital markets,"" she added.

An Amazon spokesperson had said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

2022-07-31, Investing.com,"Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview: Citi boosts SPX target",https://in.investing.com/news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-citi-boosts-spx-target-432SI-3747603,"(SPX) rose 1% last week after investors used a Thursday mini-selloff as a buying opportunity. Moreover, recent economic data shows the U.S. economy is performing stronger than expected, fueling bets that the Federal Reserve will still manage to deliver a soft landing.

While the again last week and reiterated its concern over still-elevated inflation, market participants currently do not expect further rate hikes this year.

(IXIC) gained as much as 2% last week, underpinned by gains on mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Thursday after the market close.

“The current setup is fairly similar to last quarter, where the combination of a low hurdle rate, along with the improving fundamentals, eventually led to meaningful beats. Q2 EPS projections for S&P 500 were cut significantly ahead of the reporting season, and most macro data showed a sequential improvement versus Q1,” JPMorgan analysts wrote recently.

(DJI) continues to rise, recording its 3rd consecutive weekly gain. The index also hit the highest levels seen since last February.

For this week, the (Friday) will be the highlight, along with the and .

Apple and Amazon to report

According to FactSet, 51% of S&P 500 companies reported actual results as of Friday, July 28. As many as 80% of S&P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise while 64% of S&P 500 companies reported a positive revenue surprise.

The blended earnings decline so far for the second quarter is 7.3%, worse than the expected decline of 7%. For Q3 2022, 27 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 18 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance, FactSet data shows.

“For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 0.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -20.8%,” analysts at FactSet wrote.

Citi analysts are increasingly bullish on the S&P 500’s earnings potential for 2024, hence they raised the 2022 year-end price target to 4600 and the mid-2024 target to 5000.

“These new targets will be perceived as chasing the year-to-date move in the S&P 500. However, they better reflect an evolving macro and fundamental backdrop,” they said.

Ahead of us is another super busy earnings week. Major reporting companies include Caterpillar (NYSE: ), Pfizer (NYSE: ), Uber (NYSE: ), AMD (NASDAQ: ), Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), PayPal (NASDAQ: ), Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Apple, Amazon, Block (NYSE: ), as well as online travel companies like Booking (NASDAQ: ) and Airbnb (NASDAQ: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPM: “We were OW Value vs Growth style in 2022, through longs in Commodities and in Financials, against an UW Tech, but have reversed that view for this year, partly driven by the above call from last October that US yields have peaked. We think that the OW Growth vs Value style should stay relevant through the rest of 2022.”

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 25 points, or 0.1%, traded 2 points, or 0.1%, higher, while dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.

The benchmark Wall Street indices have all recorded healthy gains this month, with the blue chip up 3.1% in July, after posting a 13-day winning streak, which ended last week. The broad-based has gained 3% and the tech-heavy 3.8%, with both of these indices on track for a fifth consecutive winning month.

Jobs report is the week’s data highlight

The raised interest rates to the highest level in 22 years last week, but also changed its forecast to no longer predict a U.S. recession this year.

Additionally, expectations are growing that inflation is slowing enough for this to be the last hike of the central bank’s year-long tightening cycle, helped by Friday’s second-quarter falling to 1.0%, a drop from 1.2% in the first quarter and a peak of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022.

Fed chair Jerome Powell made it clear any future decisions would be data dependent, which brings Friday's U.S. firmly into focus. This is expected to show that the economy added 200,000 jobs in July, while the remained at a historical low of 3.6% and cooled.

Positive earnings boost sentiment

The earnings season rolls on, with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings later this week.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second-quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Citigroup raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 by 15% earlier Monday as it now sees a higher probability of a soft landing for the U.S. economy, as well as an earnings upside.

Elsewhere, Walmart (NYSE: ) is likely to be in the spotlight after the Wall Street Journal reported that the retail giant has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group.

Crude gains on U.S. economic optimism

Oil prices rose Monday as a more upbeat look at the crude market by Goldman Sachs overshadowed weak Chinese activity data.

Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs on Sunday lifted its global oil demand forecast for the year to an all-time high of 102.8 million barrels per day in July, citing a reduced recession risk and a strong effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to push up prices.

The crude market is on track for its biggest monthly gain in over a year on expectations of tightening global supply with Saudi Arabia seen as likely to extend its production cuts into September.

By 06:30 ET, futures traded 0.7% higher at $81.17 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.6% to $84.92.

Both contracts settled on Friday at their highest levels since April, gaining for a fifth straight week, and are on track to close this month with their biggest monthly gains since January 2022.

2022-07-30, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3746062,"Investing.com -- More big tech earnings and the U.S. jobs report for July will be the main highlights in the week ahead. Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

Cindy Smith of Virginia state in the US said she never ordered those from Amazon.

""It's a lot of packages. I didn't order them and they kept coming from everybody,"" she told WUSA.

Smith drove around the town, giving packages to those who would just take them.

""A lot of people told me I was weird. I would drive around with headlamps and glue guns in the car. I gave them to everybody I met,"" she was quoted as saying.

""All my neighbours got glue guns or headlamps. I gave them to dog shelters, to veterinary clinics,"" she added.

These packages were addressed to someone called Lixiao Zhang.

According to reports, the incident is more likely linked to a different kind of vendor scheme, one that involves sellers trying to remove unsold merchandise from Amazon fulfillment centres. WUSA traced the returned packaging labels to 15 fulfillment centers in nine different US states.

Sellers in China who need to get their products out of Amazon warehouses pick random addresses and send their unwanted products there, he said, adding: ""It's just cheaper for them to do so.""

Amazon said in a statement that the seller account had violated the company's policy by engaging in ""abusive activity"" and the account has been closed.

""The onboarding of Selec Town as an 'I Have Space' store addresses the challenges faced by hundreds of customers who reside and run their businesses on Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake, which are also the most visited places in Srinagar by tourists and locals.

""Previously, these customers had to travel to the shores of the two lakes by shikaras or rely on nearby shops to collect their packages. With Selec Town, Murtaza will deliver packages to these customers every day, safely and on time at the doorstep of their houseboats”.

Karuna Shankar Pande, Director, Amazon Logistics, India said on the occasion, “We are thrilled to onboard India’s first floating ‘I Have Space’ store on Dal Lake, Srinagar.

Houseboat owner, Murtaza said, ""While I have a houseboat as my primary business, it only brings in seasonal income from tourists in Srinagar. However, the cost of managing the houseboat is very high, which has made it very difficult for our family. To address increasing expenses, I began looking for additional income opportunities. It was then that I came across Amazon’s ‘I Have Space’ program, which allows local store owners like me to supplement our regular income by delivering packages to Amazon customers.

2022-07-27, IANS,AWS launches AI-powered healthcare-focused services,https://in.investing.com/news/aws-launches-aipowered-healthcarefocused-services-3741677,"San Francisco, July 27 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) has introduced a wide range of healthcare-related applications and services that include generative artificial intelligence (AI) resources designed to assist clinicians in transcribing and evaluating their conversations with patients.

2022-07-27, IANS,AstroTalk has democratised online astrology services in India: Founder,https://in.investing.com/news/astrotalk-has-democratised-online-astrology-services-in-india-founder-3741260,"New Delhi, July 27 (IANS) Post-pandemic, life was filled with uncertainty and millions of people were worried about their future, seeking simple solutions to their problems and looking at astrology to get the right direction. AstroTalk, which made astrology services more accessible via app and is the world's largest astrology platform, let users chat with trusted and verified astrologers through its app.

Its founder, Puneet Gupta, started AstroTalk in October 2017 and within a span of few years, it became the market leader.

Gupta told IANS that the platform has seen massive traction over the past few years and reached 40 million customers cumulatively, commanding over 80 per cent market share in the Indian online astrology market.

Here are excerpts from an interaction:

Q: Tell us more about AstroTalk and its vision.

A: Astrotalk was set up primarily to help customers seek answers and guidance from trusted and verified astrologers. We at Astrotalk believe in our ancient vedic science and believe that using these sciences, we can create a positive impact on the world and the lives of our millions of customers worldwide.

Astrotalk enables consultations between customers and astrologers through our secured platform across the medium of chat , voice telephony and live streaming. The platform is positioned as a one-stop solution for all astrology and wellness needs.

Q: How has been the response to AstroTalk so far?

A: We have seen massive traction over the past few years and have reached 40 million customers cumulatively. Going forward, we will be expanding a lot internationally so that the benefits of the platform can also accrue to the global Indian diaspora. We are very bullish on the Indian market and growth story and believe that with increasing premiumization, the market for a product like Astrotalk will only expand. We already command an over 80 per cent market share in the Indian online astrology market.

Q. How do you plan to leverage Analytics and AI/ML within Astrotalk?

A. We already leverage AI/ML to create predictive algorithms for fraud detection and astrological research. Improving developer productivity has also been one of the key goals for reducing our time to market and we have recently started exploring Generative AI offerings from AWS such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) CodeWhisperer to plug any code vulnerabilities and accelerate time-consuming coding tasks.

We are also in progress of creating our own chatbot to answer support queries of the customers. With our growing platform demand, a lot of data is crunched on a real-time basis using AWS services such as RDS, S3, AWS DMS and other open-source technologies. However, we still believe that no amount of AI/ML can replace astrologer-user conversations and analysis of a true & verified astrologer.

Q: How has AWS Cloud helped you scale your growth?

A: Cloud telephony and AWS have helped us implement a truly robust scalable solution which has enabled us to scale faster. We have increased our revenues from Rs 5 crore/month in 2020 to Rs 45 crore/month now, while using AWS, hence spending less time on firefighting and optimizing infra and more time on growing the business.

One of the key challenges AstroTalk faced was the resource-intensive nature of their internal Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. AWS provided a robust solution by leveraging Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) flexibility to spawn multiple slaves, distributing the workload across them.

Additionally, using routing rules in Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), they directed CRM requests to a separate target group specifically designed for handling CRM traffic. This approach resulted in a remarkable improvement in CRM performance and significantly increased the speed of their operations teams. Metrics, such as reduced response times and improved customer satisfaction, demonstrated the effectiveness of these optimizations.

AWS offered cost-saving opportunities for Astrotalk through various services and strategies. By implementing Amazon EC2's automatic scaling groups (ASG), they were able to adapt their infrastructure dynamically to fluctuating traffic demands, thereby optimizing resource utilization and reducing costs during periods of low activity.

Moreover, they adopted gp3 disks for Amazon RDS, leading to a cost reduction of over 40 per cent compared to their previous storage solution. Additionally, they optimized storage costs by migrating call recordings from standard storage to intelligent tiering on Amazon S3, intelligently adjusting storage classes based on usage patterns.

Time to market is a critical factor in today's competitive business landscape. AWS provided Astrotalk. with the tools they needed to accelerate their software deployment process. By utilizing AWS CodeDeploy in conjunction with automatic scaling, they established a blue-green deployment pipeline. This approach allowed us to gradually roll out updates and quickly revert to previous versions in case of any bugs or issues, providing greater confidence to the development team during deployments.

Astrotalk capitalised on AWS's Autoscaling Groups and Savings Plans. Autoscaling Groups allowed them to automatically adjust the number of instances based on workload fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance without over-provisioning resources.

Astrotalk also leveraged AWS's Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service, distributing incoming traffic across multiple instances and Availability Zones (AZs) to prevent single points of failure.

The Q2 earnings report could serve as positive catalysts for as many as 10 stocks, while 2 of them could fall given high expectations.

The strategists highlight “a lowered bar for Q2 earnings” given that the Q2 EPS estimates are down about 9% year-to-date and 16.5% from the 2022 peak.

“Expectations for 2Q earnings are still moving lower into the results season and are likely to set up a typical modest beat (the historical average is +5%). However, revisions ahead of the quarter have not been as steep as they have in past quarters, meaning the hurdle may not be quite as easy. The trend for the past three quarters has been a slight beat on the current quarter but then the out-quarter revises lower,” they said in a client note.

The market expectations from the Q2 earnings season are for 0% sales growth and -9% EPS decline.

“At the sector level, consensus expects the highest relative growth in 2Q from Discretionary and Comm. Services while Healthcare, Materials, and Energy are expected to see double-digit EPS declines,” they added.

Along these lines, they highlighted 12 names for which Morgan Stanley Research analysts expect a near-term catalyst that should drive a meaningful move in each stock.

The “positive list” includes tech giants like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ), in addition to Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: ), Five9 (NASDAQ: ), Flowserve (NYSE: ), Hess (NYSE: ), S&P Global (NYSE: ), Sunrun (NASDAQ: ), Wix (NASDAQ: ), and Yum! Brands (NYSE: ).

On the other hand, the upcoming Q2 earnings reports could act as a negative catalyst for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ: ) and Warren Buffett-backed Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: ).

Elaborating more on OXY, the strategists wrote:

“Our 2Q oil production estimate is below consensus, and our capex is above consensus. We expect lower cash flow in 2Q on lower realized prices Q/Q, outlay for preferred stock redemption accrued in 1Q, and investment in NET Power, reducing the capacity for share repurchases.”"

Amazon shares are down over 1% premarket.

It is said that the lawsuit is expected as soon as August and will probably challenge various Amazon business practices.

Politico went as far as saying that, if successful, it could result in a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion powerhouse, defining the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.

However, they noted that while they know the FTC has focused on several of Amazon's business practices, the exact details of the final lawsuit aren't known, and it is expected that there will be changes to the final complaint until the eleventh hour.

The lawsuit might lead to a court-ordered “restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire”, the report noted.

The FTC has been investigating Amazon for a long time. Among the potential claims are allegations similar to existing cases like Amazon’s rules requiring third-party retailers to offer their lowest prices on its platform.

“The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services,” the report detailed, citing sources.

Both Amazon and the FTC declined to comment.

On Amazon Prime, the FTC is concerned that the “bundle of services is used to illegally cement the company’s market power”.

The FTC last month sued the e-commerce giant Amazon over alleged 'deceptive' tactics to sign up customers for its Prime service.

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

""Specifically, Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions,"" read the FTC complaint.

Amazon Prime costs $139 per year and gives consumers access to free two-day shipping, along with access to Prime Video and music streaming.

""Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,"" FTC Chair Khan had said in a statement.

""These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike. The FTC will continue to vigorously protect Americans from ""dark patterns"" and other unfair or deceptive practices in digital markets,"" she added.

An Amazon spokesperson had said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

2022-07-26, IANS,Amazon's new page lets users view product recalls & safety info,https://in.investing.com/news/amazons-new-page-lets-users-view-product-recalls--safety-info-3739244,"San Francisco, July 26 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) has launched a new 'Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts' page, which allows users to view product recalls and safety information for items they purchased in Amazon’s store. ""While we always proactively notify customers about product recalls and safety alerts, customers now have a dedicated location to view these communications in one place,"" the e-commerce company said.

With the new 'Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts' page, the company aims to make it easier for customers to be aware of recalls on products they have purchased in the store, navigate to get more information about recalls, and view available refund or return options.

If a recall is announced or a product safety alert is issued, users will receive a personalised email with details about the recall, and will see an alert banner on top of their 'Your orders' page.

This banner will link to their personal 'Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts' page for more details about potential safety hazards, as well as to the recall notice for options such as a refund, return or repair.

Earlier, users had to rely on third-party websites to learn about a product recall, and were required to submit personal information to receive instructions on what to do with a recalled product, the company said.

However, with the new feature, the e-commerce platform will be able to directly reach 100 per cent of its customers who have bought a recalled product in the store and will also provide clear instructions on what to do next.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, Amazon had introduced a new free self-serve product customisation feature ‘Customise Your Product’ in India.

This feature is available across a wide selection of more than 10,000 products from 76 different categories.

It offers an “intuitive” customisation experience which provides visual design tools to customers to personalise products, along with a product preview option to view the final customised product in real-time.

2022-07-25, Investing.com,"Microsoft and Alphabet earnings, Fed decision ahead - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-and-alphabet-earnings-fed-decision-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3737468,"Investing.com -- Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to unveil their quarterly earnings, with the results likely to set the tone for upcoming numbers from other tech sector titans. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve gears up to start a highly-anticipated policy meeting and China's government vows to roll out measures to reignite the country's flagging economic recovery.

1. Microsoft, Alphabet to report

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to post their latest earnings after the close of U.S. trading on Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

For both Microsoft and Alphabet, attention will likely center around their cloud computing businesses. The units have been consistent cash cows for both companies, although performance has suffered in recent quarters as economic uncertainty convinces many customers to rein in spending.

The weakness may have extended into the April to June quarter, according to analysts cited by Reuters. Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, the group's biggest revenue driver and home to its Azure public cloud computing platform, is seen expanding at its slowest rate since 2017 during the period. Alphabet's own cloud computing unit, meanwhile, is expected to slip to its lowest growth ever.

But some analysts say that the pressure on cloud computing may be waning, noting that many clients are beginning to figure out how to operate in a softer macroeconomic environment.

Elsewhere, generative artificial intelligence, which has driven a surge in tech stocks this year, will remain in the spotlight. The focus will be on how Microsoft and Alphabet, as well as rivals Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), plan to generate revenue from their AI offerings.

Meta Platforms is due to report its latest earnings on Wednesday and Amazon on Aug. 3.

2. Futures mixed ahead of earnings, Federal Reserve decision

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Tuesday as investors prepared themselves for a series of fresh corporate earnings and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

By 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract slipped by 3 points or 0.01%, added 7 points or 0.16%, and gained 61 points or 0.39%.

The 30-stock climbed to its eleventh straight winning session on Monday, while the benchmark and tech-heavy also rose.

Aside from Microsoft and Alphabet, Verizon (NYSE: ), General Electric (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) will also unveil results before the bell Tuesday.

Several stronger-than-expected second-quarter returns have helped to fuel hopes that the U.S. economy will engineer a soft landing in the face of surging interest rates. The is widely forecast to increase borrowing costs by another quarter percentage point on Wednesday, while Wall Street will also be keeping a close eye on comments about the broader economic outlook from the central bank's chair Jerome Powell.

3. Fed to kick off two-day meeting

Fed policymakers will begin their closely-watched two-day meeting on Tuesday with markets already largely pricing in a 25-basis point interest rate increase later this week.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is currently a more than 98% chance that the bank will lift interest rates to a new range of 5.25% to 5.50% following the conclusion of its latest gathering on Wednesday.

The near-consensus projections could lend additional importance to remarks from Powell. In particular, observers will be on the lookout for any signals that the Fed could be planning to bring its long-standing policy-tightening campaign to a halt.

Crucially, recent data has pointed to a softening in inflation, which had been the main driver behind the Fed's historic string of rate rises. But with uncertainty still surrounding how price growth will evolve over the coming months, there remains the possibility that the Fed could retain the flexibility to hike rates further if necessary.

4. China promises economic support measures

The decision-making body of China's ruling Communist Party has pledged to step up measures aimed at reinvigorating a post-COVID recovery that it described as ""tortuous.""

Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slowed substantially in the as its biggest drivers -- manufacturing and real estate -- remained under pressure.

In response, Beijing will adjust its policy to help boost domestic demand, support confidence and prevent risks, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the 24-member politburo. These changes would also aim to ""stabilize"" foreign trade, the politburo was quoted as saying following a Monday meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.

Chinese shares rallied on Tuesday following the news, with technology and property stocks posting particularly strong gains.

5. Oil holds firm after China support pledges

Oil prices stabilized near three-month highs, with traders digesting China's plans for more stimulus measures and signs of tight supplies ahead of the Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.

U.S. inventory data are also in focus. Industry numbers from the American Petroleum Institute are due out on Tuesday, followed on Wednesday by the official figures from the Energy Information Administration. Stockpiles are expected to have fallen by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 21, indicating steady demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

At 09:12 ET, the futures traded 0.27% lower at $78.53 a barrel, while the contract dropped by 0.34% to $82.20 per barrel.

Both benchmarks climbed by more than 2% in the previous session, touching their highest closing levels since April."

So that we can keep innovating, we are changing our Premium prices across a number of markets around the world. These updates will help us continue to deliver value to fans and artists on our platform,"" Spotify said in a blogpost on Monday.

Apart from the US, Spotify is increasing prices in 53 other countries, including Canada, France, the UK, Mexico and Australia.

Moreover, the music streaming giant said that the existing subscribers will be notified about the price changes via email and be given a “one-month grace period” before the new prices go into effect.

Last fall, Apple (NASDAQ: ) Music had hiked its subscription fee for individuals to $10.99 per month, with the family plan increasing to $16.99/month, among other changes.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Music Unlimited also hiked its monthly rate to $10.99 (for non-Prime members).

Last week, Google-owned YouTube increased the price of a Premium individual plan by $2 in the US for new and current customers.

Users will now have to pay $13.99 per month instead of $11.99.

The plan will cost $18.99 if users are subscribing from the iOS YouTube app.

2022-07-24, Investing.com,This car company made it on to Citi's top AI stocks list and it is not Tesla,https://in.investing.com/news/this-car-company-made-it-on-to-citis-top-ai-stocks-list-and-it-is-not-tesla-432SI-3736234,"Citi analysts reiterated a positive medium-term outlook on the artificial intelligence (AI) theme as Wall Street continues to position itself for a business transformation that is taking place around the globe.

They especially highlighted the free cash flow (FCF) aspect that AI strengthens, in addition to the fact that GenAI is “positively impacting near- and longer-term EPS estimates as some monetization strategies come out earlier than expected.”

“Investors may be overlooking free cash flow. Profitable stocks within this theme are already impressive cash generating machines. Recent AI developments should accentuate this characteristic and push FCF margins and growth to new highs,” analysts said in a client note.

As a result, Citi strategists highlighted a number of AI-exposed stocks that are expected to outpace their market-implied growth expectations and see FCF margins rise in the near term.

Names that made it on to the list include Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Mastercard (NYSE: ), ServiceNow (NYSE: ), and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: ).

“Overall, at the single stock and aggregate level, we believe it is fair to say expectations are quite lofty for AI. However, strong fundamental tailwinds mean this lofty expectation could actually be met by companies. While the AI trade is no longer in its infancy given strong year-to-date moves, prices are still below prior peaks even though fundamental trajectories are much more impressive and visible for some names given generative AI development and applications,” analysts concluded.

The only car manufacturer on the list is Ford Motor (NYSE: )."
2022-07-24, Investing.com,"Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 weekly preview: All eyes on Microsoft",https://in.investing.com/news/dow-jones-nasdaq-sp-500-weekly-preview-all-eyes-on-microsoft-432SI-3736112,"S&P 500 ( ) gained 0.7% last week although the bulls weren’t able to secure a strong weekly close after printing a fresh 15-month-high. Still, the last week marked the eighth green weekly candle for the S&P 500 in the last 10 weeks as the generative AI frenzy keeps fueling the equities bull run.

Nasdaq ( ) lost 0.6% despite a strong rally in the opening days of the last week, ultimately resulting in a shooting star candle – which is a bearish near-term signal for tech-heavy IXIC. A short-term pullback could push the index to revisit important support around 13200, suggesting a pullback of around 6%.

On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) surged 2.1% to finally break out of the tight trading range. Last week’s high marks the highest the DJI index traded since April 2022.

This week is packed with U.S. economic data, starting with preliminary and results for July. The interest rate decision is out on Wednesday with the market fully expecting another – and possibly final – 25 bps rate hike.

""The key question is how strongly [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell will nod toward the 'careful pace' of tightening he advocated in June, which we and others have taken to imply an every-other-meeting approach,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said last week.

On Thursday, we will see the preliminary numbers for the second quarter, coupled with the for July. Finally, the - Price Index report is out on Friday.

Mega-caps take the stage

The Q2 earnings season is in full swing after several mega-caps, including (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ), reported last week. So far, 18% of the S&P 500 companies reported actual results with 75% of those reported topping EPS estimates, according to FactSet.

“It’s still too early to determine how the Q2 earnings season will turn out. That said, in our view “so far so good” with five sectors showing positive double digit earnings growth (energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services and real estate), three sectors posting positive single digit earnings growth (consumer staples, health care and financials), and two sectors delivering double digit negative earnings growth (materials and information technology),” Oppenheimer strategists said.

For Q2 2022, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 is -9.0%, which is higher than the expected earnings decline of 7%.

“The (blended) net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q2 2022 is 11.1%, which is below the previous quarter’s net profit margin (11.5%), below the year-ago net profit margin (12.2%), and below the 5-year average (11.4%). If 11.1% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the sixth straight quarter in which the net profit margin for the index has declined year-over-year,” FactSet analysts wrote in a blog post on Friday.

Some of the most notable companies to report this week include General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Wedbush analysts argue that Street’s focus is on Microsoft.

“The entire Street will be laser focused on one print this week: Microsoft. While this is a massive week for Big Tech earnings season there is no better barometer of the overall cloud and enterprise spending environment than Redmond and all eyes will be glued to the screens Tuesday after the bell,” they said in a client note.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Morgan Stanley analysts: “2022 has been a story of higher valuations than we expected amid falling inflation and cost-cutting. However, disinflation is now eating into sales growth, which means investor focus is likely to shift toward top line growers rather than just companies exhibiting cost efficiencies.”

Oppenheimer analysts: “We remain highly constructive on equities on expectations that economic fundamentals are likely to remain resilient if not robust in this period of significant transition tied to monetary policy. Corporations, the consumer and labor continue to reflect in our view resilience characteristic with a recovery process from a period of crisis and great uncertainty into a period of sustainable economic growth.”

Barclays analysts: “Valuations are up and earnings are in the hot seat as we enter the busiest weeks of summer reporting season. Estimates are heading lower for most sectors, while uncertainty is high for Big Tech. Two potential sources of downside: negative operating leverage worsened by faster disinflation, and China exposure.”

Berenberg analysts: “US equities look expensive in both absolute and relative terms compared to non-US equities. Equity bond yield gaps (excluding Japan) have compressed or even reversed in the last 12- 18 months. However, the gap between the US equity-bond yield gap and non-US yield gaps is near historical highs – this suggests more relative support for non-US equities versus local bonds than in the US. In absolute terms, US equities trade above a 12-month forward P/E of 20x for only the third time in the last 50 years; the last two times that US equities have been this expensive were both liquidity-fuelled bubbles.”

Goldman Sachs analysts: “We believe recent valuation expansion despite higher rates is reasonable considering the longer-term relationship between rates and equities, the improvement in expected growth, and the high market concentration in stocks benefiting from AI optimism. While our baseline forecast assumes a slight contraction in the S&P 500 P/E multiple to 19x by year-end, we believe risks to valuations are tilted to the upside if the multiples of laggards “catch up” or yields fall.”"

They see “a significant opportunity for GPU supplier NVDA” with the TAM (total addressable market) expanding 10 times over the next 5 years to more than $400 billion.

“We see AI server unit penetration reaching ~11% by C27E, and NVDA, with conservative ~75% share (vs. 90%+ today), potentially driving ~$300B in AI-specific revenue,” they said in a client note.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is expected to have a ~5% of AI server share by 2027. The analysts also highlighted Amazon’s (NASDAQ: ) AWS Inferentia, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) Dojo, or Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google that could capture AI market share gains.

“We see more room to unlock value with solid AI roadmaps accelerating.”

Despite robust YTD gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock, Mizuho sees room for this rally to continue.

“Assuming $30-100B AI revenues (or ~$65B at the midpoint), we estimate implied share price to reflect AI estimates for C23-25E would be $490-$769/share, and a midpoint at ~$625 PT,” the analysts concluded.

The $769/share price implies Nvidia’s market cap at ~$1.9 trillion.

Spotify CEO Daniel Ek has previously stated that the company is considering raising prices in the US in response to price rises by competitors such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) Music, according to the report.

""When our competitors are raising their prices, that is really good for us,"" he said on the company's third-quarter 2022 earnings call in October.

Moreover, Ek stated that raising membership prices in the US, the world's largest music market by far, ""is one of the things we would like to do and it's something we will (discuss) with our label partners. I feel good about this upcoming year, and what it means about pricing for our service"".

Apple Music hiked its subscription fee for individuals last fall to $10.99 per month, with the family plan increasing by two dollars to $16.99/month, among other changes.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Music Unlimited hiked its monthly rate to $10.99 (for non-Prime members).

This week, Google-owned YouTube has increased the price of a Premium individual plan by $2 in the US for new and current customers.

Users will now have to pay $13.99 per month instead of $11.99. The plan will cost $18.99 if users are subscribing from the iOS YouTube app.

2022-07-22, IANS,7 top tech companies sign deal with US govt on AI guardrails,https://in.investing.com/news/7-top-tech-companies-sign-deal-with-us-govt-on-ai-guardrails-3734368,"Washington, July 22 (IANS) Seven leading artificial intelligence (AI) tech companies like Google (NASDAQ: ), OpenAI and Meta (NASDAQ: ) have reached a deal with the Joe Biden administration to roll out fresh guardrails to manage risks associated with AI.The measures would include testing the security of AI and making the results of those tests public. The companies are Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Anthropic, Meta, Google, Inflection and OpenAI.

""These commitments are real, and they are concrete. AI is going to change the lives of people around the world. The people here will be critical for shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design,"" Biden said at the White House following the meeting late on Friday.

""AI should benefit the whole of society. For that to happen, these powerful new technologies need to be built and deployed responsibly,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.

""As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,"" he added.

As part of the agreement, the tech companies have agreed to security testing of their AI systems by internal and external experts before their release.

This will ensure that people are able to spot AI by implementing watermarks and publicly report AI capabilities and limitations on a regular basis.

These companies will also research the risks such as bias, discrimination and the invasion of privacy.

""This is a serious responsibility, we have to get it right. There's enormous, enormous potential upside as well,"" said Biden.

OpenAI said that the watermarking agreements would require the companies to ""develop tools or APIs to determine if a particular piece of content was created with their system.""

Google has committed to deploy similar disclosures earlier this year.

Earlier this week, Meta said that it would open-source its large language model Llama 2, making it free for researchers, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4.

""While we always proactively notify customers about product recalls and safety alerts, customers now have a dedicated location to view these communications in one place,"" the e-commerce company said.

With the new 'Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts' page, the company aims to make it easier for customers to be aware of recalls on products they have purchased in the store, navigate to get more information about recalls, and view available refund or return options.

If a recall is announced or a product safety alert is issued, users will receive a personalised email with details about the recall, and will see an alert banner on top of their 'Your orders' page.

This banner will link to their personal 'Your Recalls and Product Safety Alerts' page for more details about potential safety hazards, as well as to the recall notice for options such as a refund, return or repair.

Earlier, users had to rely on third-party websites to learn about a product recall, and were required to submit personal information to receive instructions on what to do with a recalled product, the company said.

2022-07-25, Investing.com,"Microsoft and Alphabet earnings, Fed decision ahead - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-and-alphabet-earnings-fed-decision-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3737468,"Investing.com -- Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to unveil their quarterly earnings, with the results likely to set the tone for upcoming numbers from other tech sector titans. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve gears up to start a highly-anticipated policy meeting and China's government vows to roll out measures to reignite the country's flagging economic recovery.

1. Microsoft, Alphabet to report

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to post their latest earnings after the close of U.S. trading on Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

For both Microsoft and Alphabet, attention will likely center around their cloud computing businesses. The units have been consistent cash cows for both companies, although performance has suffered in recent quarters as economic uncertainty convinces many customers to rein in spending.

The weakness may have extended into the April to June quarter, according to analysts cited by Reuters. Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, the group's biggest revenue driver and home to its Azure public cloud computing platform, is seen expanding at its slowest rate since 2017 during the period. Alphabet's own cloud computing unit, meanwhile, is expected to slip to its lowest growth ever.

But some analysts say that the pressure on cloud computing may be waning, noting that many clients are beginning to figure out how to operate in a softer macroeconomic environment.

Elsewhere, generative artificial intelligence, which has driven a surge in tech stocks this year, will remain in the spotlight. The focus will be on how Microsoft and Alphabet, as well as rivals Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), plan to generate revenue from their AI offerings.

Meta Platforms is due to report its latest earnings on Wednesday and Amazon on Aug. 3.

2. Futures mixed ahead of earnings, Federal Reserve decision

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Tuesday as investors prepared themselves for a series of fresh corporate earnings and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

By 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract slipped by 3 points or 0.01%, added 7 points or 0.16%, and gained 61 points or 0.39%.

The 30-stock climbed to its eleventh straight winning session on Monday, while the benchmark and tech-heavy also rose.

Aside from Microsoft and Alphabet, Verizon (NYSE: ), General Electric (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) will also unveil results before the bell Tuesday.

Several stronger-than-expected second-quarter returns have helped to fuel hopes that the U.S. economy will engineer a soft landing in the face of surging interest rates. The is widely forecast to increase borrowing costs by another quarter percentage point on Wednesday, while Wall Street will also be keeping a close eye on comments about the broader economic outlook from the central bank's chair Jerome Powell.

3. Fed to kick off two-day meeting

Fed policymakers will begin their closely-watched two-day meeting on Tuesday with markets already largely pricing in a 25-basis point interest rate increase later this week.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is currently a more than 98% chance that the bank will lift interest rates to a new range of 5.25% to 5.50% following the conclusion of its latest gathering on Wednesday.

The near-consensus projections could lend additional importance to remarks from Powell. In particular, observers will be on the lookout for any signals that the Fed could be planning to bring its long-standing policy-tightening campaign to a halt.

Crucially, recent data has pointed to a softening in inflation, which had been the main driver behind the Fed's historic string of rate rises. But with uncertainty still surrounding how price growth will evolve over the coming months, there remains the possibility that the Fed could retain the flexibility to hike rates further if necessary.

4. China promises economic support measures

The decision-making body of China's ruling Communist Party has pledged to step up measures aimed at reinvigorating a post-COVID recovery that it described as ""tortuous.""

Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slowed substantially in the as its biggest drivers -- manufacturing and real estate -- remained under pressure.

In response, Beijing will adjust its policy to help boost domestic demand, support confidence and prevent risks, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the 24-member politburo. These changes would also aim to ""stabilize"" foreign trade, the politburo was quoted as saying following a Monday meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.

Chinese shares rallied on Tuesday following the news, with technology and property stocks posting particularly strong gains.

5. Oil holds firm after China support pledges

Oil prices stabilized near three-month highs, with traders digesting China's plans for more stimulus measures and signs of tight supplies ahead of the Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.

U.S. inventory data are also in focus. Industry numbers from the American Petroleum Institute are due out on Tuesday, followed on Wednesday by the official figures from the Energy Information Administration. Stockpiles are expected to have fallen by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 21, indicating steady demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

At 09:12 ET, the futures traded 0.27% lower at $78.53 a barrel, while the contract dropped by 0.34% to $82.20 per barrel.

Both benchmarks climbed by more than 2% in the previous session, touching their highest closing levels since April."

They especially highlighted the free cash flow (FCF) aspect that AI strengthens, in addition to the fact that GenAI is “positively impacting near- and longer-term EPS estimates as some monetization strategies come out earlier than expected.”

“Investors may be overlooking free cash flow. Profitable stocks within this theme are already impressive cash generating machines. Recent AI developments should accentuate this characteristic and push FCF margins and growth to new highs,” analysts said in a client note.

As a result, Citi strategists highlighted a number of AI-exposed stocks that are expected to outpace their market-implied growth expectations and see FCF margins rise in the near term.

Names that made it on to the list include Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Mastercard (NYSE: ), ServiceNow (NYSE: ), and NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: ).

“Overall, at the single stock and aggregate level, we believe it is fair to say expectations are quite lofty for AI. However, strong fundamental tailwinds mean this lofty expectation could actually be met by companies. While the AI trade is no longer in its infancy given strong year-to-date moves, prices are still below prior peaks even though fundamental trajectories are much more impressive and visible for some names given generative AI development and applications,” analysts concluded.

The only car manufacturer on the list is Ford Motor (NYSE: )."

Still, the last week marked the eighth green weekly candle for the S&P 500 in the last 10 weeks as the generative AI frenzy keeps fueling the equities bull run.

Nasdaq ( ) lost 0.6% despite a strong rally in the opening days of the last week, ultimately resulting in a shooting star candle – which is a bearish near-term signal for tech-heavy IXIC. A short-term pullback could push the index to revisit important support around 13200, suggesting a pullback of around 6%.

On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) surged 2.1% to finally break out of the tight trading range. Last week’s high marks the highest the DJI index traded since April 2022.

This week is packed with U.S. economic data, starting with preliminary and results for July. The interest rate decision is out on Wednesday with the market fully expecting another – and possibly final – 25 bps rate hike.

""The key question is how strongly [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell will nod toward the 'careful pace' of tightening he advocated in June, which we and others have taken to imply an every-other-meeting approach,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said last week.

On Thursday, we will see the preliminary numbers for the second quarter, coupled with the for July. Finally, the - Price Index report is out on Friday.

Mega-caps take the stage

The Q2 earnings season is in full swing after several mega-caps, including (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ), reported last week. So far, 18% of the S&P 500 companies reported actual results with 75% of those reported topping EPS estimates, according to FactSet.

“It’s still too early to determine how the Q2 earnings season will turn out. That said, in our view “so far so good” with five sectors showing positive double digit earnings growth (energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services and real estate), three sectors posting positive single digit earnings growth (consumer staples, health care and financials), and two sectors delivering double digit negative earnings growth (materials and information technology),” Oppenheimer strategists said.

For Q2 2022, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 is -9.0%, which is higher than the expected earnings decline of 7%.

“The (blended) net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q2 2022 is 11.1%, which is below the previous quarter’s net profit margin (11.5%), below the year-ago net profit margin (12.2%), and below the 5-year average (11.4%). If 11.1% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the sixth straight quarter in which the net profit margin for the index has declined year-over-year,” FactSet analysts wrote in a blog post on Friday.

Some of the most notable companies to report this week include General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Wedbush analysts argue that Street’s focus is on Microsoft.

“The entire Street will be laser focused on one print this week: Microsoft. While this is a massive week for Big Tech earnings season there is no better barometer of the overall cloud and enterprise spending environment than Redmond and all eyes will be glued to the screens Tuesday after the bell,” they said in a client note.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Morgan Stanley analysts: “2022 has been a story of higher valuations than we expected amid falling inflation and cost-cutting. However, disinflation is now eating into sales growth, which means investor focus is likely to shift toward top line growers rather than just companies exhibiting cost efficiencies.”

Oppenheimer analysts: “We remain highly constructive on equities on expectations that economic fundamentals are likely to remain resilient if not robust in this period of significant transition tied to monetary policy. Corporations, the consumer and labor continue to reflect in our view resilience characteristic with a recovery process from a period of crisis and great uncertainty into a period of sustainable economic growth.”

Barclays analysts: “Valuations are up and earnings are in the hot seat as we enter the busiest weeks of summer reporting season. Estimates are heading lower for most sectors, while uncertainty is high for Big Tech. Two potential sources of downside: negative operating leverage worsened by faster disinflation, and China exposure.”

Berenberg analysts: “US equities look expensive in both absolute and relative terms compared to non-US equities. Equity bond yield gaps (excluding Japan) have compressed or even reversed in the last 12- 18 months. However, the gap between the US equity-bond yield gap and non-US yield gaps is near historical highs – this suggests more relative support for non-US equities versus local bonds than in the US. In absolute terms, US equities trade above a 12-month forward P/E of 20x for only the third time in the last 50 years; the last two times that US equities have been this expensive were both liquidity-fuelled bubbles.”

Goldman Sachs analysts: “We believe recent valuation expansion despite higher rates is reasonable considering the longer-term relationship between rates and equities, the improvement in expected growth, and the high market concentration in stocks benefiting from AI optimism. While our baseline forecast assumes a slight contraction in the S&P 500 P/E multiple to 19x by year-end, we believe risks to valuations are tilted to the upside if the multiples of laggards “catch up” or yields fall.”"

They see “a significant opportunity for GPU supplier NVDA” with the TAM (total addressable market) expanding 10 times over the next 5 years to more than $400 billion.

“We see AI server unit penetration reaching ~11% by C27E, and NVDA, with conservative ~75% share (vs. 90%+ today), potentially driving ~$300B in AI-specific revenue,” they said in a client note.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is expected to have a ~5% of AI server share by 2027. The analysts also highlighted Amazon’s (NASDAQ: ) AWS Inferentia, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) Dojo, or Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google that could capture AI market share gains.

“We see more room to unlock value with solid AI roadmaps accelerating.”

Despite robust YTD gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock, Mizuho sees room for this rally to continue.

“Assuming $30-100B AI revenues (or ~$65B at the midpoint), we estimate implied share price to reflect AI estimates for C23-25E would be $490-$769/share, and a midpoint at ~$625 PT,” the analysts concluded.

The $769/share price implies Nvidia’s market cap at ~$1.9 trillion.

The companies are Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Anthropic, Meta, Google, Inflection and OpenAI.

""These commitments are real, and they are concrete. AI is going to change the lives of people around the world. The people here will be critical for shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design,"" Biden said at the White House following the meeting late on Friday.

""AI should benefit the whole of society. For that to happen, these powerful new technologies need to be built and deployed responsibly,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.

""As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,"" he added.

As part of the agreement, the tech companies have agreed to security testing of their AI systems by internal and external experts before their release.

This will ensure that people are able to spot AI by implementing watermarks and publicly report AI capabilities and limitations on a regular basis.

These companies will also research the risks such as bias, discrimination and the invasion of privacy.

""This is a serious responsibility, we have to get it right. There's enormous, enormous potential upside as well,"" said Biden.

OpenAI said that the watermarking agreements would require the companies to ""develop tools or APIs to determine if a particular piece of content was created with their system.""

Google has committed to deploy similar disclosures earlier this year.

Earlier this week, Meta said that it would open-source its large language model Llama 2, making it free for researchers, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4.

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.5%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street closed in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the blue chip gaining over 160 points, or 0.5%. This was its ninth straight positive close and longest streak of increases since 2017, and its highest close since March 2022.

The tech-heavy , however, fell almost 300 points, or 2.1%, its largest one-day decline in over four months, weighed by poorly received results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Positive earnings help sentiment

The earnings season has been largely beneficial so far, with 73% of the companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data.

Banks have dominated the first week, benefiting from rising interest rates, although the major lenders have had to cope with a slump in deal making.

Regional lenders like Comerica (NYSE: ) and Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE: ) end the week, along with credit card giant American Express (NYSE: ), but attention has largely switched to next week and numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Microsoft/Activision deal now more likely

The potential $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) now looks more likely to proceed after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the deal.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, but their opposition has been showing signs of softening.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

Fed meeting looms large

Away from the corporate sector, next week sees a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points.

Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle or signal more hikes ahead is likely to guide sentiment in the weeks ahead.

Oil rises on Chinese stimulus hopes

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, and raising expectations of more widespread support.

By 06:30 ET, the futures traded 1.3% higher at $76.63 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.3% to $80.64. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 1% this week.

Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

Amazon was maintained at Outperform, while they kept an Underperform rating on Wayfair.

Analysts said that a lot of focus this year has been on Q2 setting the tone as a jumping-off point for top-line growth acceleration and better profitability through 2H23.

""With FX headwinds abating and a more durable online consumer, count us in that camp of anticipating further eCommerce recovery,"" they wrote.

""The group, particularly the higher beta names, are pricing in the improvement already. But Q2 earnings will put the thesis to the test and guidance will help dimension the magnitude of the re-acceleration and the incremental margins on this growth. The latter is particularly relevant for AMZN,"" analysts added.

They noted that in the second quarter, U.S. e-commerce looked a lot like the first quarter, and they have a positive outlook into the second half of the year.

""We estimate the US market grew 8% Y/Y in Q2, in-line with Q1. However, after a soft April, eCommerce recovered and accelerated through the quarter,"" said analysts. They also stated that Europe is turning the corner, albeit slowly."

Ahead of the numbers, BofA Securities analysts issued positive commentary and are looking for signs of a bottom for AWS growth.

The analysts see the company posting revenue and GAAP profit of $132.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, which is above the consensus of $131.5B and $4.7B. On AWS, analysts note that the Street is looking for 6-7 points of deceleration to 9.5% year-over-year. The analysts view this as ""achievable.""

""While July AWS growth expectations may have been as low as 8% in May, we think expectations may have moved higher (towards 10%) on recent 3P data,"" analysts commented. ""Tough 2Q comp set up for AWS vs. Azure is a trading risk (MSFT reports 7/25), but we think positive could be AWS growth is nearing a bottom in July (easing comps).""

On the retail side of Amazon's business, analysts are above consensus for 2Q margins, and they expect positive commentary on efficiency opportunities, which would be consistent with the CEO's recent CNBC interview.

On guidance, they see third-quarter revenue and profit of $139.9B and $5.7B, respectively, versus the consensus of $138B and $5.2B.

Further, analysts see a “favorable” fourth-quarter AWS comp setup. “2H’22 (last year) had both disappointing sequential AWS dollar adds and the worst eCommerce holiday since the Great Recession, in our view, setting up easier comps. The Street projects AWS growth in the 9-10% Y/Y range through 2H’23 (per Bloomberg), which could be conservative as AWS laps the start of last year’s optimization cycle, and we see upside potential on retail efficiencies.”

While shares are up 58% year-to-date, the analysts note the stock is still trading below their historical EBITDA multiple averages – currently at 13.5x versus 17.4x since 20210. As such, they think further multiple expansion is possible and reiterated a Buy rating and $154 price target."

The country's competition watchdog found that both the companies ""unreasonably restricted the number of resellers of Apple products on the Amazon website in Spain"".

The tech giants also ""limited the advertising spaces where competing Apple products can be advertised on the Amazon website in Spain"".

""Finally, they limited the possibility of Amazon directing marketing campaigns to customers of Apple products on its website in Spain to offer them competing products from other brands,"" the authority said in a statement.

Now, both Apple and Amazon have agreed to include a series of clauses in the contracts that regulate the conditions of Amazon as an Apple distributor that affected the sale of Apple products and other brands on the Amazon website in Spain.

According to the watchdog, more than 90 per cent of the resellers who had been using the Amazon website in Spain for the retail sale of Apple products were excluded from the main online market in the country.

""Sales of Apple products through the Amazon website in Spain by sellers based in other EU countries were reduced, thus limiting trade between member states and there was an increase in the relative prices paid by consumers for the purchase of Apple products in said online market in Spain,"" the antitrust authority noted.

2022-07-18, IANS,US lawmaker moves bill to double H-1B visas,https://in.investing.com/news/us-lawmaker-moves-bill-to-double-h1b-visas-3728725,"Washington, July 19 (IANS) A US lawmaker has introduced legislation proposing to double the annual intake of foreign workers on H-1B visas, a short-term work permit that has been a gateway for Indians to work, live and, eventually, seek citizenship of this country.The bill introduced last Friday by Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Indian-descent Democratic lawmaker, seeks to boost the annual H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.

The US runs the H-1B visa programme to make up for the shortage of speciality workers, although critics have argued that the shortage is highly exaggerated and that the programme is being used by American companies to use less expensive foreign workers brought here by IT services companies.

An estimated 75 per cent of the H-1B visa granted in a year add up to 85,000 -- 65,000 workers hired abroad and 20,000 recruited from foreign students enrolled in US colleges and universities -- are known to go workers from India, hired by some of the largest US tech giant such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) as well as IT services behemoths like Infosys (NS: ), TCS (NS: ) and Wipro (NS: ).

Krishnamoorthi said in a press announcement on Tuesday that the expansion of the H-1B visa programme will help American companies get workers for direly needed positions. He is calling the legislation the HIRE Act, short for High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment.

“Creating jobs and building the economy of the future requires us to lead the way in technology by developing our domestic workforce while drawing the best talent from around the world,” said Krishnamoorthi. “That is why I am proud to introduce the HIRE Act to increase investments in elementary and secondary school STEM education while doubling the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. By investing in our homegrown talent while attracting the best minds from around the world, we can create better-paying jobs and harness the technology of tomorrow.”

The legislation also seeks to address the shortage of skilled workers at home here in the US by funding STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering and Math) streams in schools.

“The US needs to maintain its leadership in technology and innovation,” Vinay Mahajan, president of an advocacy group for IT services companies, said in the same announcement. “The startup eco-system needs to be supercharged. One critical component of both is high-skilled workers. The US has a large skills gap -- availability of workers vs the openings for talent in IT. The HIRE Act focuses on reducing this gap through high-skilled immigration and funding for growing local STEM talent. We need the brightest minds from all over the world to keep our wide lead in technology and innovation.”

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.5%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street closed in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the blue chip gaining over 160 points, or 0.5%. This was its ninth straight positive close and longest streak of increases since 2017, and its highest close since March 2022.

The tech-heavy , however, fell almost 300 points, or 2.1%, its largest one-day decline in over four months, weighed by poorly received results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Positive earnings help sentiment

The earnings season has been largely beneficial so far, with 73% of the companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data.

Banks have dominated the first week, benefiting from rising interest rates, although the major lenders have had to cope with a slump in deal making.

Regional lenders like Comerica (NYSE: ) and Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE: ) end the week, along with credit card giant American Express (NYSE: ), but attention has largely switched to next week and numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Microsoft/Activision deal now more likely

The potential $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) now looks more likely to proceed after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the deal.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, but their opposition has been showing signs of softening.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

Fed meeting looms large

Away from the corporate sector, next week sees a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points.

Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle or signal more hikes ahead is likely to guide sentiment in the weeks ahead.

Oil rises on Chinese stimulus hopes

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, and raising expectations of more widespread support.

By 06:30 ET, the futures traded 1.3% higher at $76.63 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.3% to $80.64. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 1% this week.

Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

But gains have been tempered as traders exercised caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting. The has also rebounded from a 15-month low ahead of the gathering.

2022-07-21, IANS,Motorola razr 40 ultra heats up foldable race with striking features,https://in.investing.com/news/motorola-razr-40-ultra-heats-up-foldable-race-with-striking-features-3732918,"New Delhi, July 21 (IANS) The foldable form factor for smartphones has come of age and despite some mobile manufacturers yet to grasp the reality, foldable and flip devices are creating a bigger space for themselves in people’s lives in India.The foldable (including flip) smartphones are likely to contribute over 1.8 per cent of the total smartphone revenue in India this year, reaching over Rs 6,300 crore in India.

This is expected to be achieved by selling over 6.35 lakh foldable smartphones during the year. This translates to less than 0.5 per cent of the total sales by volume estimated for the period, according to market research firm techARC.

Motorola, the pioneer of the flip phones, has once again disrupted the Indian smartphone market with the launch of razr 40 ultra and razr 40.

Leading the pack is the razr 40 ultra which is the thinnest flippable smartphone in the industry when flipped closed — and includes the powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 Mobile Platform, efficient battery, and the largest external display of any flip phone.

Let us see if the device can further disrupt the Indian market.

It offers Corning Gorilla Glass Victus Protection ensuring durability for rough usage.

The large external display opens up several possibilities for consumers, from content creation to applying makeup or taking quick look before you take a selfie.

When it flips open, it reveals a nearly creaseless and ultra-smooth display, which has a vivid 6.9-inch pOLED screen with the highest screen refresh rate of 165Hz and peak brightness of 1400nits.

Motorola razr40, also comes with a similar display configuration with a refresh rate peaks at 144Hz which makes it ultra smooth too.

It also has a Night Vision mode for video to capture brighter footage with more detail, better clarity, and more accurate colour in low-light environments.

The 13MP ultrawide + macro vision lens allows for wide-angle shots that fit 3X more into the frame than a standard lens.

Users can also flip open the phone and use the 32MP front camera for selfies and video calls.

Now, the processor. The Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor comes with advanced AI and fast refresh rates, and 5G connections.

It also packs Dolby Atmos for an enhanced audio experience, with multi-dimensional sound which brings out more clarity, detail, and depth.

Regarding the battery, the razr 40 ultra has an ultra-fast 33W TurboPower charger coming in the box and supports wireless charging, on a lasting battery size of 3800mAH, which is larger than the previous generation.

It runs on Android 13 and comes with a promise of three OS upgrades and four years of security patches.

The device comes in Viva Magenta colour in a premium vegan leather design and Infinite Black.

In India, Motorola razr40 ultra (8+256GB) is available on Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Motorola.in, Reliance (NS: ) Digital and other leading retail stores at Rs 89,999, with some attractive cash back and ‘No Cost EMI’ offers.

Amazon was maintained at Outperform, while they kept an Underperform rating on Wayfair.

Analysts said that a lot of focus this year has been on Q2 setting the tone as a jumping-off point for top-line growth acceleration and better profitability through 2H23.

""With FX headwinds abating and a more durable online consumer, count us in that camp of anticipating further eCommerce recovery,"" they wrote.

""The group, particularly the higher beta names, are pricing in the improvement already. But Q2 earnings will put the thesis to the test and guidance will help dimension the magnitude of the re-acceleration and the incremental margins on this growth. The latter is particularly relevant for AMZN,"" analysts added.

They noted that in the second quarter, U.S. e-commerce looked a lot like the first quarter, and they have a positive outlook into the second half of the year.

""We estimate the US market grew 8% Y/Y in Q2, in-line with Q1. However, after a soft April, eCommerce recovered and accelerated through the quarter,"" said analysts. They also stated that Europe is turning the corner, albeit slowly."
2022-07-19, Investing.com,"Amazon seen beating in Q2, with favorable comp setup - BofA",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-seen-beating-in-q2-with-favorable-comp-setup--bofa-432SI-3729831,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 27th. Ahead of the numbers, BofA Securities analysts issued positive commentary and are looking for signs of a bottom for AWS growth.

The analysts see the company posting revenue and GAAP profit of $132.4 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, which is above the consensus of $131.5B and $4.7B. On AWS, analysts note that the Street is looking for 6-7 points of deceleration to 9.5% year-over-year. The analysts view this as ""achievable.""

""While July AWS growth expectations may have been as low as 8% in May, we think expectations may have moved higher (towards 10%) on recent 3P data,"" analysts commented. ""Tough 2Q comp set up for AWS vs. Azure is a trading risk (MSFT reports 7/25), but we think positive could be AWS growth is nearing a bottom in July (easing comps).""

On the retail side of Amazon's business, analysts are above consensus for 2Q margins, and they expect positive commentary on efficiency opportunities, which would be consistent with the CEO's recent CNBC interview.

On guidance, they see third-quarter revenue and profit of $139.9B and $5.7B, respectively, versus the consensus of $138B and $5.2B.

Further, analysts see a “favorable” fourth-quarter AWS comp setup. “2H’22 (last year) had both disappointing sequential AWS dollar adds and the worst eCommerce holiday since the Great Recession, in our view, setting up easier comps. The Street projects AWS growth in the 9-10% Y/Y range through 2H’23 (per Bloomberg), which could be conservative as AWS laps the start of last year’s optimization cycle, and we see upside potential on retail efficiencies.”

While shares are up 58% year-to-date, the analysts note the stock is still trading below their historical EBITDA multiple averages – currently at 13.5x versus 17.4x since 20210. As such, they think further multiple expansion is possible and reiterated a Buy rating and $154 price target."

“We are witnessing a seismic shift in where and how content will be consumed, and I believe that Tubi can become the destination for the next generation of audiences,” Sud said in a statement.

“The future of streaming TV is free, and I am excited to join the Tubi team to help shape the next wave of entertainment, by giving all people access to all the world’s stories. Tubi is doing things differently in a space that is being imminently disrupted, and that is my kind of opportunity,” she added.

Sud's appointment comes as Tubi recently became the most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the US, with the streamer reporting 64 million monthly active users, according to Nielsen.

Acquired by Fox for $440 million in 2020, Tubi also surpassed PlutoTV, Peacock and HBO Max in total TV viewing minutes.

Under Sud’s leadership as CEO of Vimeo, the platform established itself as the home for video creators and professionals worldwide, building a thriving community of over 300 million users and generating scaled revenue growth and significant cash flow.

Before her tenure at Vimeo, Sud held positions in finance, media and e-commerce at Time Warner and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

The price target on Chewy stock is $50 per share, up from the prior $42.

The upgrade comes amid Goldman’s “preference for platforms with greater exposure to less discretionary categories and that can lean on large ecosystems of buyers/subscribers for added visibility on forward revenue trends.”

“We modestly raise our forward operating estimates (both revenue and Adj. EBITDA) to reflect: a) increased confidence in more stable customer growth and rising revenue trends; & b) steady margin progression driven by gross margin expansion (reflecting revenue mix shift) and SG&A leverage as Chewy executes on its supply chain transformation and automation.”

2022-07-17, Investing.com,Nasdaq 100 special rebalance is unlikely to solve the concentration problem - Goldman Sachs,https://in.investing.com/news/nasdaq-100-special-rebalance-is-unlikely-to-solve-the-concentration-problem--goldman-sachs-432SI-3725830,"Goldman Sachs strategists weighed in on the upcoming ‘Special Rebalance”, aimed at tackling the index’s high level of concentration among seven big tech stocks.

The event will take place on July 24 with the weight of the largest 7 stocks in the index expected to drop by 12% (56% to 44%). Still, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) will remain the largest constituents.

Overall, the Info Tech sector will continue to account for roughly half of the Nasdaq 100 index.

“We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day’s average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day’s volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,” strategists said in a client note.

Still, strategists argue that the special rebalance “will have a limited impact on the affected stocks.” Goldman Sachs expects Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: ) index weight to increase the most (from 2.4% to 3.0%).

“In 2011, Nasdaq slashed the NDX weight of AAPL from 20% to 12%, but this change had no clear negative effect on the stock’s performance. Likewise, there was no clear impact on MSFT despite its index weight rising by nearly 5 pp to 8% following the rebalance. In fact, MSFT lagged AAPL during the weeks around the rebalance.”

In this context, strategists don’t believe that the upcoming event will “solve the challenge that elevated current market concentration poses for many benchmarked investors.”

“Even after the rebalance, the NDX will remain too concentrated to be considered an actively managed “diversified” fund according to the SEC (stocks greater than 5% weight will total 32% of the index),” they concluded."

The deal, structured as an all-equity transaction, represents Styched's foray into the footwear segment.

“The technical know-how of Flatheads would really help us create a wide range of affordable sneakers collection. While Styched will continue to play in the sub-Rs 1,000 segment, the semi-premium segment would have Flatheads as the flagship brand,” said Soumajit Bhowmik, CEO at Styched.

Initially, Flatheads will continue offering its existing range of products, with all departments now being operated and managed by Styched.

This will be followed by a hiring phase aimed at strengthening the footwear department within Styched, said the company.

“The market is evolving, and it will be a unique journey for the category, different from other parts of the world. It will be fulfilling to see Flatheads being an integral part of the market creation and growth,” said Balakrishnan.

Styched's founders have been associated with brands like Jabong, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Foodpanda at leadership positions.

2022-07-16, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3725097,"Investing.com -- Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear, the U.S. and China release economic data and inflation figures out of the U.K. will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike. Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.

1. Earnings time

Second-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ: ) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with expected on Wednesday.

Tesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) recently dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the ’s rally.

There are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.

A slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE: ) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Philip Morris (NYSE: ).

2. U.S. economic data

U.S. retail sales data for June on Tuesday is expected to show an increase of , boosted by rebounding auto sales and higher gasoline station sales, indicating that consumer demand remains resilient.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on , and . High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.

There will also be reports on activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on .

3. China economic data

A flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.

Gross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.

However, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.

Mounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.

4. U.K. inflation

The U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike.

The headline consumer price index is expected to ease to year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.

In its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.

This could make August’s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.

5. Oil prices

Oil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.

""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.

Oil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.

Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally.

The Top 7 stocks drove 73 per cent of S&P 500 gains in 1H, each up 90 per cent on average in 1H.

These have a market capitalisation of roughly equivalent to half of US GDP.

They gained $4tn+ YTD, more than GDP growth of Japan (3rd largest economy).

Apple’s market capitalisation exceeds that of the entire index.

Tech, Media, and Telecom (TMT) companies have contributed 30 per cent of S&P 500’s earnings growth since 2010.

TMT represents 8 per cent of US GDP, 17 per cent of S&P EPS and 40 per cent of S&P mkt cap, the report said.

On the reasons for market concentration, the report said ultra-low rates and a lackluster economy in the 2010s created the perfect petri dish for idiosyncratic, secular growth and disruptive themes to flourish.

This coupled with market-capitalisation weighted index inflows favoring larger companies, global Tech Wars driving big spend, fiscal support and lighter regulation, a pandemic hastening more tech adoption, e-commerce, cloud, today’s nascency-to-maturity theme: AI, and Tech IPOs incubating longer and debuting as hypergrowth mega caps.

“Irrational exuberance, top-heavy markets and speculative bubbles of one sort or another trace back to the 1700s’ tulips. In our career, the of the mid-90s morphed into the Internet Bubble of the late ‘90s, the Housing Bubble of the 2000s, cryptocurrency of the 2010s,” the report said.

Bubbles fueled by excessive leverage, democratisation of markets and rampant speculation tend to end badly. But real disruptors can do well. The 2000 Tech Bubble saw consolidation and relative losses for about a decade but 1 in 5 IPOS of the late 1990s survived and are today’s blue chips.

2022-07-15, IANS,Nasdaq 100 index to get a makeover as ‘Magificent Seven’ get too concentrated,https://in.investing.com/news/nasdaq-100-index-to-get-a-makeover-as-magificent-seven-get-too-concentrated-3724660,"New York, July 15 (IANS) The Nasdaq-100 index is getting a fresh look, the media reported.The index comprises 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the and the popular Invesco QQQ exchange-traded fund tracks the index, CNN reported.

Seven companies listed in the Nasdaq-100 accounted for roughly 51 per cent of the index as of June 3, according to a note by Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates.

The Nasdaq is looking to fix that problem -- without changing any of the stocks in the index, CNN reported.

Those top seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), dubbed by some the 'Magnificent Seven', have skyrocketed this year on artificial intelligence buzz.

They have also driven the lion’s share of the market’s rally this year, though the market’s run has widened in recent weeks to include a more diverse basket of stocks, CNN reported.

Nvidia shares have surged about 215 per cent for the year, Apple jumped 47 per cent and Microsoft gained 43 per cent.

Nvidia reached a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year, while Apple topped a $3 trillion market cap last month.

The huge gains mean that these big tech stocks have become bloated in some indexes, which are often weighted by market capitalisation.

That can pose a problem to investors, since it leaves the market vulnerable to large swings driven by just a handful of companies, CNN reported.

Donald Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors, says investors should be careful when examining an index like the Nasdaq-100’s performance, especially when considering its run is highly concentrated in just a handful of stocks with sky-high valuations, CNN reported.

“Investors should really reassess what’s in their portfolio -- why is it in their portfolio? And are they comfortable with the risks that they’re taking?” asked Calcagni.

The tech-heavy index will undergo a “special rebalance” in just a couple weeks, according to Nasdaq.

“We are witnessing a seismic shift in where and how content will be consumed, and I believe that Tubi can become the destination for the next generation of audiences,” Sud said in a statement.

“The future of streaming TV is free, and I am excited to join the Tubi team to help shape the next wave of entertainment, by giving all people access to all the world’s stories. Tubi is doing things differently in a space that is being imminently disrupted, and that is my kind of opportunity,” she added.

Sud's appointment comes as Tubi recently became the most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the US, with the streamer reporting 64 million monthly active users, according to Nielsen.

Acquired by Fox for $440 million in 2020, Tubi also surpassed PlutoTV, Peacock and HBO Max in total TV viewing minutes.

The event will take place on July 24 with the weight of the largest 7 stocks in the index expected to drop by 12% (56% to 44%). Still, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) will remain the largest constituents.

Overall, the Info Tech sector will continue to account for roughly half of the Nasdaq 100 index.

“We estimate that declining weights will drive passive net selling worth more than a day’s average trading volume in GOOGL and more than one-third of a day’s volume in MSFT, AMZN, and NVDA,” strategists said in a client note.

Still, strategists argue that the special rebalance “will have a limited impact on the affected stocks.” Goldman Sachs expects Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: ) index weight to increase the most (from 2.4% to 3.0%).

“In 2011, Nasdaq slashed the NDX weight of AAPL from 20% to 12%, but this change had no clear negative effect on the stock’s performance. Likewise, there was no clear impact on MSFT despite its index weight rising by nearly 5 pp to 8% following the rebalance. In fact, MSFT lagged AAPL during the weeks around the rebalance.”

In this context, strategists don’t believe that the upcoming event will “solve the challenge that elevated current market concentration poses for many benchmarked investors.”

“Even after the rebalance, the NDX will remain too concentrated to be considered an actively managed “diversified” fund according to the SEC (stocks greater than 5% weight will total 32% of the index),” they concluded."

2022-07-16, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3725097,"Investing.com -- Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear, the U.S. and China release economic data and inflation figures out of the U.K. will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike. Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.

1. Earnings time

Second-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ: ) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with expected on Wednesday.

Tesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) recently dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the ’s rally.

There are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.

A slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE: ) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Philip Morris (NYSE: ).

2. U.S. economic data

U.S. retail sales data for June on Tuesday is expected to show an increase of , boosted by rebounding auto sales and higher gasoline station sales, indicating that consumer demand remains resilient.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on , and . High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.

There will also be reports on activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on .

3. China economic data

A flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.

Gross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.

However, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.

Mounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.

4. U.K. inflation

The U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike.

The headline consumer price index is expected to ease to year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.

In its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.

This could make August’s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.

5. Oil prices

Oil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.

""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.

Oil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.

Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally.

The Top 7 stocks drove 73 per cent of S&P 500 gains in 1H, each up 90 per cent on average in 1H.

These have a market capitalisation of roughly equivalent to half of US GDP.

They gained $4tn+ YTD, more than GDP growth of Japan (3rd largest economy).

Apple’s market capitalisation exceeds that of the entire index.

Tech, Media, and Telecom (TMT) companies have contributed 30 per cent of S&P 500’s earnings growth since 2010.

TMT represents 8 per cent of US GDP, 17 per cent of S&P EPS and 40 per cent of S&P mkt cap, the report said.

On the reasons for market concentration, the report said ultra-low rates and a lackluster economy in the 2010s created the perfect petri dish for idiosyncratic, secular growth and disruptive themes to flourish.

This coupled with market-capitalisation weighted index inflows favoring larger companies, global Tech Wars driving big spend, fiscal support and lighter regulation, a pandemic hastening more tech adoption, e-commerce, cloud, today’s nascency-to-maturity theme: AI, and Tech IPOs incubating longer and debuting as hypergrowth mega caps.

“Irrational exuberance, top-heavy markets and speculative bubbles of one sort or another trace back to the 1700s’ tulips. In our career, the of the mid-90s morphed into the Internet Bubble of the late ‘90s, the Housing Bubble of the 2000s, cryptocurrency of the 2010s,” the report said.

Bubbles fueled by excessive leverage, democratisation of markets and rampant speculation tend to end badly. But real disruptors can do well. The 2000 Tech Bubble saw consolidation and relative losses for about a decade but 1 in 5 IPOS of the late 1990s survived and are today’s blue chips.

Seven companies listed in the Nasdaq-100 accounted for roughly 51 per cent of the index as of June 3, according to a note by Louis Navellier, chairman of Navellier & Associates.

The Nasdaq is looking to fix that problem -- without changing any of the stocks in the index, CNN reported.

Those top seven stocks, Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), dubbed by some the 'Magnificent Seven', have skyrocketed this year on artificial intelligence buzz.

They have also driven the lion’s share of the market’s rally this year, though the market’s run has widened in recent weeks to include a more diverse basket of stocks, CNN reported.

Nvidia shares have surged about 215 per cent for the year, Apple jumped 47 per cent and Microsoft gained 43 per cent.

Nvidia reached a $1 trillion market cap earlier this year, while Apple topped a $3 trillion market cap last month.

The huge gains mean that these big tech stocks have become bloated in some indexes, which are often weighted by market capitalisation.

That can pose a problem to investors, since it leaves the market vulnerable to large swings driven by just a handful of companies, CNN reported.

Donald Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors, says investors should be careful when examining an index like the Nasdaq-100’s performance, especially when considering its run is highly concentrated in just a handful of stocks with sky-high valuations, CNN reported.

“Investors should really reassess what’s in their portfolio -- why is it in their portfolio? And are they comfortable with the risks that they’re taking?” asked Calcagni.

The tech-heavy index will undergo a “special rebalance” in just a couple weeks, according to Nasdaq.

Amazon said on Thursday that this year's Prime Day event was bigger than ever, with Prime members purchasing more than 375 million items. It was the ""single largest sales day in company history,"" Amazon said.

""On PD Day 1, Prime Members purchased 375M+ items (+25% Y/Y) and saved $2.5B+ (+47% Y/Y) and we note Adobe suggests US PD sales rose 6% Y/Y (we note PD contributed ~400 bps to overall sales growth in '21 and' 22),"" Citi analysts wrote, who have a Buy rating and $145 price target on the stock.

""Amazon highlighted Home, Fashion, and Beauty as key verticals and we believe greater adoption of its advertising products improved conversion rates while Buy with Prime expanded Prime Day beyond Amazon.com.""

At BofA, analysts who have a Buy rating and $154 price target on Amazon, said Prime Day units were very strong, meaning share gains are likely.

""The 375mn+ unit metric is up 25% y/y vs. 'more than 300mn' for Prime Day 2022, with growth accelerating 5pts from 20% implied unit growth last year. Discounting also seemed heavy; Amazon indicated members saved >$2.5bn (+47% y/y vs $1.7bn last year) 'across the Amazon store,' suggesting further savings with Buy with Prime,"" they said.

Wells Fargo analysts believe the Prime Day release suggests an above-expectation GMV and revenue growth.

""We believe Prime Day represented 4% of 3Q:22 NA + Int'l segment revs. WFSe estimates $10.3B GMV vs. 2022 $8.3B, increase commensurate with unit growth,"" they said, maintaining an Overweight rating and $159 price target on Amazon.

""Strong Prime Day could represent demand 'pull-forward', but believe it's likely a positive read-through on 3Q revenue trajectory (WFSe +10%). Adobe projected 6-7% growth, though we believe that estimate is irreconcilable with reported figures,"" they added."

“As alleged in the indictment, Shakeeb Ahmed, who was a senior security engineer at an international technology company, used his expertise to defraud the exchange and its users and steal approximately $9 million in cryptocurrency,” said US Attorney Damian Williams.

“We also allege that he then laundered the stolen funds through a series of complex transfers on the blockchain where he swapped cryptocurrencies, hopped across different crypto blockchains, and used overseas crypto exchanges,” he added.

According to the DOJ, he laundered the millions in fees that he stole to conceal their source and ownership.

Ahmed is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Watching for signs that inflation is cooling

Investors are hoping that a cooling off of could convince the Federal Reserve to come to the end of its interest rate increases in the near future.

Wednesday’s report is expected to show the pace of inflation has eased off considerably from last year, though prices are still higher than the Fed’s target rate.

Futures traders are expecting the Fed to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point this month after pausing at their June meeting. But then expectations for later this year start to diverge. Some see another rate hike this fall.

Investors are also listening to what a spate of Fed officials are saying in appearances this week to get any clues on the central bank’s thinking heading into the meeting this month.

rebalance after rally leads to overconcentration

An end to the Fed’s rate hiking could boost tech stocks, which rallied in the first half of the year. Nasdaq is planning to rebalance its 100 index to adjust the weightings after the megacap names led to overconcentration.

One tech giant, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), was rising 0.4% as it kicked off its annual Prime Day online sale, something that has inspired other retailers to launch sales events of their own. Target (NYSE: ) is also having a promotion, as is Walmart (NYSE: ).

2022-07-11, Investing.com,This internet stock is a new Top Pick at Evercore ISI with upside potential of 75%,https://in.investing.com/news/this-internet-stock-is-a-new-top-pick-at-evercore-isi-with-upside-potential-of-75-432SI-3719259,"Evercore ISI analysts reflected on the Internet sector with a positive view ahead of the Q2 earnings season. The analysts are “tactically constructive” on the large caps despite the broker’s coverage of 19 stocks being up 44% year-to-date.

“Given the rally in the Net stocks, we’re tempted to downgrade our investment opinion. But we won’t for two reasons – Multiples are still depressed – i.e. below average – and Fundamentals are still soft – i.e. revenue growth rates are weak,” analysts wrote in a client note.

On the valuation front, they highlighted Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Etsy (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) as stocks that are trading “well below their pre-Covid Median.”

Analysts picked Uber (NYSE: ) as the new No.1 long in their coverage of internet stocks. Uber replaces Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) stock, which is up 141% YTD and which moves down to the 3rd spot while Amazon remains 2nd on the list of best internet stocks to own.

“UBER has one of the strongest top-line growth outlooks among the companies we cover and faces a series of potential “value catalysts” – the attainment of GAAP profitability in H2, the initiation of capital returns, possibly also in H2, and S&P 500 inclusion,” analysts said.

“Further, we believe its Mobility segment is likely to be relatively recession-resistant from a demand perspective (we still gotta commute) and may actually have a recession hedge from a supply perspective (driving is a quick side-hustle for many). Our recent survey work suggests that demand for Delivery may actually be as “utilitarian” as the demand for Mobility, which implies a most robust outlook than the market may appreciate.”

Hence, the analysts concluded by saying that Uber stock looks well-positioned to re-rate as more and more investors are convinced of Uber’s ability to deliver over $4 billion in free cash flow in 2024.

Evercore ISI’s price target of $75 per share on Uber stock implies an upside potential of over 75%."
2022-07-11, Investing.com,Nasdaq 100 rebalance will benefit these 7 stocks - Wells Fargo,https://in.investing.com/news/nasdaq-100-rebalance-will-benefit-these-7-stocks--wells-fargo-432SI-3719242,"Wells Fargo analysts reflected on the upcoming Special Rebalance that is taking place on Friday, July 21.

A Special Rebalance is usually conducted to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights. This particular move is focused on reducing concentration risk and reducing the dominance of the Big Seven, namely Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

“With uber-caps overbought, near-term liquidity demands will likely weigh on the group. In 2011, down-sized names lagged by 2-3% between announcement and event,” analysts said in a client note.

While these seven stocks will be down-sizers, Wells Fargo analysts expect the following stocks to benefit from the upcoming rebalancing: Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ), Booking.com (NASDAQ: ), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: ), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ), Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ), and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ).

Back to the down-sizers, analysts expect Microsoft’s weight to fall by 1.8%, while Apple should lose 1.7%. Nvidia, Amazon, and Google are expected to lose around 1%.

“We believe this liquidity event dents—but does not break—the longer-term uber-cap trend. In our view, similar to 2000, an aggressive Fed that pushes the US into recession is what ultimately undoes the uber-cap and “new economy” trades. As long as the economy remains in a malaise (i.e., not a recession), rather optimistic valuation premiums and growth estimates are difficult to refute,” analysts concluded."

Bullard scheduled to speak

The parade of central bank officials continues Tuesday in advance of their quiet period before the Fed meeting, with St. Louis Fed President scheduled to speak later in the session.

Fed policymakers started the week by hinting that the end of the U.S. central bank’s tightening cycle is near, as investors will be interested to see if Bullard, who has tended to be one of the more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, continues this theme.

U.S. June CPI looms large

The U.S. small business confidence climbed to a seven-month high in June as pessimism about the economic outlook diminished sharply and sales expectations improved, but focus this week will be on the June U.S. on Wednesday, which could influence the thinking of Fed officials.

Although the headline figure is expected to cool to 3.1% annually, the slowest increase since March 2021, the reading, which is closely watched by Federal Reserve policymakers, is seen rising by 5.0% year-on-year and 0.3% .

Apple (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the iPhone maker opened a store on the WeChat messaging app, in a bid by the California-based tech giant to boost its retail presence in China.

Crude rises on weak dollar

Oil prices rose Tuesday, helped by the falling to a two-month low, with this weakness making crude cheaper for foreign buyers, amid growing expectations that the Fed was close to ending its rate hike cycle.

Ahmed’s LinkedIn profile revealed he is a senior security engineer at Amazon.

The company, however, said he is no longer employed.

The crypto exchange Ahmed hit operated on the blockchain.

While the exchange was not named, reports said it matches last year's theft from Crema Finance, a Solana-based DEX.

In July 2022, Ahmed carried out an attack on the crypto exchange by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the its smart contracts and inserting fake pricing data to fraudulently cause that smart contract to generate approximately $9 millionworth of inflated fees that he did not legitimately earn, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement.

“As alleged in the indictment, Shakeeb Ahmed, who was a senior security engineer at an international technology company, used his expertise to defraud the exchange and its users and steal approximately $9 million in cryptocurrency,” said US Attorney Damian Williams.

“We also allege that he then laundered the stolen funds through a series of complex transfers on the blockchain where he swapped cryptocurrencies, hopped across different crypto blockchains, and used overseas crypto exchanges,” he added.

According to the DOJ, he laundered the millions in fees that he stole to conceal their source and ownership.

Ahmed is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, each of which carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Watching for signs that inflation is cooling

Investors are hoping that a cooling off of could convince the Federal Reserve to come to the end of its interest rate increases in the near future.

Wednesday’s report is expected to show the pace of inflation has eased off considerably from last year, though prices are still higher than the Fed’s target rate.

Futures traders are expecting the Fed to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point this month after pausing at their June meeting. But then expectations for later this year start to diverge. Some see another rate hike this fall.

Investors are also listening to what a spate of Fed officials are saying in appearances this week to get any clues on the central bank’s thinking heading into the meeting this month.

rebalance after rally leads to overconcentration

An end to the Fed’s rate hiking could boost tech stocks, which rallied in the first half of the year. Nasdaq is planning to rebalance its 100 index to adjust the weightings after the megacap names led to overconcentration.

One tech giant, Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), was rising 0.4% as it kicked off its annual Prime Day online sale, something that has inspired other retailers to launch sales events of their own. Target (NYSE: ) is also having a promotion, as is Walmart (NYSE: ).

Bank earnings coming up

2022-07-11, Investing.com,This internet stock is a new Top Pick at Evercore ISI with upside potential of 75%,https://in.investing.com/news/this-internet-stock-is-a-new-top-pick-at-evercore-isi-with-upside-potential-of-75-432SI-3719259,"Evercore ISI analysts reflected on the Internet sector with a positive view ahead of the Q2 earnings season. The analysts are “tactically constructive” on the large caps despite the broker’s coverage of 19 stocks being up 44% year-to-date.

“Given the rally in the Net stocks, we’re tempted to downgrade our investment opinion. But we won’t for two reasons – Multiples are still depressed – i.e. below average – and Fundamentals are still soft – i.e. revenue growth rates are weak,” analysts wrote in a client note.

On the valuation front, they highlighted Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Etsy (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) as stocks that are trading “well below their pre-Covid Median.”

Analysts picked Uber (NYSE: ) as the new No.1 long in their coverage of internet stocks. Uber replaces Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) stock, which is up 141% YTD and which moves down to the 3rd spot while Amazon remains 2nd on the list of best internet stocks to own.

“UBER has one of the strongest top-line growth outlooks among the companies we cover and faces a series of potential “value catalysts” – the attainment of GAAP profitability in H2, the initiation of capital returns, possibly also in H2, and S&P 500 inclusion,” analysts said.

“Further, we believe its Mobility segment is likely to be relatively recession-resistant from a demand perspective (we still gotta commute) and may actually have a recession hedge from a supply perspective (driving is a quick side-hustle for many). Our recent survey work suggests that demand for Delivery may actually be as “utilitarian” as the demand for Mobility, which implies a most robust outlook than the market may appreciate.”

Hence, the analysts concluded by saying that Uber stock looks well-positioned to re-rate as more and more investors are convinced of Uber’s ability to deliver over $4 billion in free cash flow in 2024.

Evercore ISI’s price target of $75 per share on Uber stock implies an upside potential of over 75%."
2022-07-11, Investing.com,Nasdaq 100 rebalance will benefit these 7 stocks - Wells Fargo,https://in.investing.com/news/nasdaq-100-rebalance-will-benefit-these-7-stocks--wells-fargo-432SI-3719242,"Wells Fargo analysts reflected on the upcoming Special Rebalance that is taking place on Friday, July 21.

A Special Rebalance is usually conducted to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights. This particular move is focused on reducing concentration risk and reducing the dominance of the Big Seven, namely Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

“With uber-caps overbought, near-term liquidity demands will likely weigh on the group. In 2011, down-sized names lagged by 2-3% between announcement and event,” analysts said in a client note.

While these seven stocks will be down-sizers, Wells Fargo analysts expect the following stocks to benefit from the upcoming rebalancing: Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ), Booking.com (NASDAQ: ), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: ), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ), Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ), and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ).

Back to the down-sizers, analysts expect Microsoft’s weight to fall by 1.8%, while Apple should lose 1.7%. Nvidia, Amazon, and Google are expected to lose around 1%.

“We believe this liquidity event dents—but does not break—the longer-term uber-cap trend. In our view, similar to 2000, an aggressive Fed that pushes the US into recession is what ultimately undoes the uber-cap and “new economy” trades. As long as the economy remains in a malaise (i.e., not a recession), rather optimistic valuation premiums and growth estimates are difficult to refute,” analysts concluded."

Bullard scheduled to speak

The parade of central bank officials continues Tuesday in advance of their quiet period before the Fed meeting, with St. Louis Fed President scheduled to speak later in the session.

Fed policymakers started the week by hinting that the end of the U.S. central bank’s tightening cycle is near, as investors will be interested to see if Bullard, who has tended to be one of the more hawkish members of the Federal Open Market Committee, continues this theme.

U.S. June CPI looms large

The U.S. small business confidence climbed to a seven-month high in June as pessimism about the economic outlook diminished sharply and sales expectations improved, but focus this week will be on the June U.S. on Wednesday, which could influence the thinking of Fed officials.

Although the headline figure is expected to cool to 3.1% annually, the slowest increase since March 2021, the reading, which is closely watched by Federal Reserve policymakers, is seen rising by 5.0% year-on-year and 0.3% .

Crude rises on weak dollar

For Q2 2022, the estimated earnings decline for the is -7.2%, which would mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020.

The focus of Wolfe’s analysts is on the Online Ads and eCommerce sector. Along these lines, the analysts highlight the following 5 stocks:

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) – Wolfe Research has an ""Outperform"" rating and a $150 per share price target on META shares. The analysts have “reasonable confidence” that Meta will deliver positive estimate revision in the second half of 2022. “META should report solid 2Q results with revenues coming at or near the high-end of the prior guidance range ($32B). Our checks with digital advertising agencies intra-quarter indicated strong trends in April, May, and early June driven by growth in ad budgets, improving ROIs, and incremental adoption of Advantage+ across a wider range of advertiser cohorts,” they said. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – The analysts hiked the price target on the ""Outperform""-rated Amazon stock by $10 to $150 per share. They see the upside potential for Amazon in the context of Q2 EBIT numbers. “We expect 2Q to be a healthy print for AMZN. We see a path for retail margins, specifically in North America, to expand steadily over the next few quarters. However, it likely takes a few more quarters until retail EBIT margin reaches pre-COVID levels,” they said. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) – Google shares also received a boost at Wolfe with the price target being raised to $140 per share. Still, Wolfe Research analysts seem less bullish on GOOGL than on META and AMZN. “We don’t see meaningful risks to GOOGL’s search revenue growth trajectory in the near-term. However, 2H margin risks (from potential ramp in hiring and other costs including NFL YT content deal) keep our excitement on GOOGL shares tempered NT.” Pinterest (NYSE: ) – The analysts are looking for signs of improving growth rates. They reiterated an ""Outperform"" rating on PINS and a $33 per share price target, while the stock remains “one of our top picks for 2H.” “We think the company is making steady progress on several long-term initiatives, the effect of which is somewhat masked by the impact of deceleration in discretionary consumer spending during 1Q.” MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) – The company is likely to report “strong top-line growth in commerce and fintech businesses in several key markets,” the analysts predict.

2022-07-09, Investing.com,This week in tech: Meta's meteoric Threads launch; Rivian's auspicious week,https://in.investing.com/news/this-week-in-tech-metas-meteoric-threads-launch-rivians-auspicious-week-3716422,"By Louis Juricic and Sarina Isaacs

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: Meta's massive Threads launch (and Twitter's lawsuit warning); a boost for Alibaba ; and radiant headlines for Rivian.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Meta's Threads app launches with a bang - and a legal threat

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday that its new Threads app - which some are calling the ""Twitter killer"" - had already amassed 70 million signups after its Wednesday-night launch, thanks in large part to its tremendous Instagram user base.

A day earlier, Twitter responded to the launch by threatening to sue Meta, according to a letter sent by Twitter attorney Alex Spiro that Semafor obtained.

The letter accuses Meta of attempting to create a ""copycat"" app by unlawfully poaching numerous ex-Twitter employees, then tasking these employees with developing the Threads app with the intention of utilizing Twitter's trade secrets and intellectual property in order to expedite the app's creation. The letter demands that Meta immediately cease use of that information.

Meta, via its communications director Andy Stone, posted on the new app that no one on the Threads team is a former Twitter employee.

Elon Musk tweeted, “competition is fine, cheating is not.”

Bank of America analysts said that Meta has a history of successfully replicating competitor apps without serious legal challenges, adding:

Until further facts surrounding the claim emerge or further steps are taken by either party, we anticipate that the current threat of legal action will have limited immediate impact on the ramp of the app. However, if Threads was to grow to a size similar to, or larger than, Twitter, we could see possibility of antitrust issues with cross platform data use.

Meta shares gained 2% for the week.







Alibaba pops on lower-than-anticipated China fine

U.S.-listed shares in Alibaba (NYSE: ) spiked 8% Friday after the Chinese government slapped its fintech arm Ant Group with a lower-than-expected 7.12 billion yuan fine ($985M). Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares (HK: ) closed up 3.4% for the session.

Reuters previously reported that Ant was set to be fined at least 8B yuan (roughly $1.1B).

The penalty - the biggest placed on a Chinese internet company since regulators fined ride-sharing app Didi Global (OTC: ) for $1.2B last year - concludes a multiyear revamp of Ant that was initiated by the People's Bank of China following the scrapping of the fintech firm's planned $37B flotation in 2020.

Ant said that it will “comply with the terms of the penalty in all earnestness and sincerity and continue to further enhance our compliance governance.”

The end of the overhaul could mean that Ant will be able to secure a financial holding company license and, potentially, bolster a revival of an initial public offering. Before the IPO was scuttled, some investors had valued Ant at over $300B.

Meanwhile, New York-listed shares of Alibaba peers Baidu (NASDAQ: ) and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) each rose more than 3%.

Rivian's explosive week

Electric carmaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) soared last week on several pieces of good news: better-than-expected production numbers, word that Amazon (NASDAQ: ) will deploy its first Rivian vans in Europe, and warming sentiment among Wall Street analysts.

First, on Monday, Rivian surged more than 17% after the company said it produced 13,992 vehicles - a 59% year-over-year jump - overcoming Street expectations for 12,640. The company, which has been struggling with supply-chain hurdles, also reiterated its annual production target of 50,000 units.

Then, on Wednesday, Amazon said that 300 of the vehicles will take to the roads in a number of regions in Germany over the coming weeks, including Munich, Berlin, and Düsseldorf. They constitute Rivian's first commercial shipments outside of the U.S.

Amazon, which is also the largest shareholder in Rivian, had already ordered 100,000 of these vans and began to roll them out in several U.S. cities last year. By 2030, Amazon says it plans to have 100,000 Rivian vans in operation globally.

Amid the positive headlines, DA Davidson upgraded the stock to Neutral from Underperform, arguing that the entry into Europe came “far earlier than we anticipated.” The analyst added:

While 2Q deliveries were short of our model, they beat consensus expectations (a low bar, in our view). The recent ABRP acquisition adds new capabilities and valuable data as well.

Separately, Needham & Company added Rivian to its Conviction List and raised its price target to $28 from the prior $26. Mizuho kept its Buy rating on the stock, but cut its 12-month price target to $27 from the prior $30.

All told, Rivian shares rocketed about 52% for the week to $24.70.

2022-07-08, IANS,Samsung Galaxy M34 5G: Offers feature-rich experience at affordable price,https://in.investing.com/news/samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-offers-featurerich-experience-at-affordable-price-3715900,"New Delhi, July 8 (IANS) Samsung (KS: ) has just launched its new smartphone Galaxy M34 5G in the country, which is a feature-packed smartphone providing a premium experience at an affordable price.The new smartphone comes with an impressive rear panel design, showcasing a distinctive camera setup adorned with three separate rings.

Furthermore, the handset's edges feature elegant curves, ensuring a comfortable and satisfying grip during use, even when playing games.

We used the Galaxy M34 5G in Midnight Blue colour for a week, specifically the 6GB+126GB variant. After thorough usage, here are our thoughts on Samsung's latest device.

When it comes to design, the M34 5G comes with a sleek and stylish design on the back. However, it's worth noting that without a back case, the phone tends to attract fingerprints quite easily, which can sometimes diminish its overall appearance.

On the front, the smartphone features a 6.5-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display provides a good viewing experience even in bright sunlight.

Now, let's dive into the camera capabilities of the Galaxy M34 5G. This smartphone is equipped with a triple-lens camera system on the rear. It houses a main 50 MP (OIS) No Shake camera and on the front, it features a 13 MP camera.

Overall, the smartphone's camera provides great performance for its price range, especially when capturing photos in well-lit environments.

It also comes with the Nightography feature which provides satisfying low-light shots.

The new smartphone comes packed with a large 6,000mAh battery, but it provides an average charging speed because it only supports 25W of fast charging.

It also comes with an interesting Fun Mode, which has 16 different in-built lens effects allowing customers to express themselves through their smartphone camera.

The new smartphone comes in three colours-- Midnight Blue, Prism and Waterfall Blue and is available for pre-order on Amazon (NASDAQ: ). As an introductory offer, Galaxy M34 5G will be available at an all-inclusive price of Rs 16,999 for the 6+128GB variant and Rs 18,999 for the 8+128GB variant with select bank cards.

Conclusion: The Samsung Galaxy M34 5G is an affordable smartphone that offers impressive camera capabilities, a vibrant display, long battery life and solid performance.

It is a good option for budget-conscious consumers as it provides excellent value for money and delivers a feature-rich experience that exceeds expectations in its price range.

2022-07-07, The News Crypto,CESS Presents at the Prestigious IVS 2022 Conference in Kyoto,https://in.investing.com/news/cess-presents-at-the-prestigious-ivs-2022-conference-in-kyoto-3715682,"Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (CESS), the 3rd-gen decentralized cloud-based data storage protocol built exclusively for Web3, has recently presented at IVS 2022 – the biggest and most influential startup conference in Japan. CESS Co-founder and Chairman Nick Zaldastani and COO and Co-Founder Jessie Dai both attended the event and shared opinions on decentralized storage, enterprise blockchain opportunities, and the impact of infrastructure on decentralization.

Issues pertaining to data ownership are a recurring theme and have grown in importance as the blockchain space has matured and evolved. Nick Zaldastani spoke in depth about how new changes in data ownership paradigms are drastically changing and improving legacy approaches to data storage:

“Decentralized storage is quickly becoming the bedrock of blockchain. Legacy systems and approaches no longer work in a Web3 world, and CESS was built to provide the scalability, stability, reliability, performance, cost-savings, and security demanded by new applications, systems, and platforms that depend on vast amounts of secure and accessible data of all kinds to function effectively. We were delighted to present at the conference and look forward to taking things to another level over the weeks and months to come.”

Jesse Dai also shared her thoughts on the event and said: “When compared with other Web3 storage projects, CESS offers unmatched storage costs, higher file reliability, more secure and efficient storage proofs, and lightning-fast upload and retrieval speeds. When taken together, these capabilities cement our project’s value proposition as the ideal partner for enterprises and projects that need speed, performance, and reliability in the fast-paced and dynamic world of Web3 applications and data. At IVS2022, we’ve had the opportunity to educate attendees about our offerings while networking with potential collaborators and partners and look forward to the next round of innovation, growth, and partnerships that will inevitably result from this high-profile conference.”

CESS is pioneering new innovations in decentralized storage that not only give complete ownership and control of user data back to users – in complete contrast to the approach of centralized platforms such as, for example, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and YouTube, where the platform typically owns and controls user data – and CESS also empowers users to permit or restrict access to their data to different entities and remove or scrub data from the Internet whenever and however they choose.

To do this, CESS uses a combination of groundbreaking tech innovations, including Multiple Data Storage Proof Schemes represented by Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR²), Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of Space-time (PoSt), Proof of Flow (PoF), Proof of Availability and Storage (PoAs). Other technologies include Multi-Format Data Rights Confirmation (MDRC) and Proxy Re-encryption Technology (PReT) to ensure data ownership and data privacy.

PoDR² is used to guarantee that the system always holds multiple copies of user data files for retrieval. PoRep guarantees that miners have replicated the data as assigned. In order to verify that data files remain on storage nodes during the contract period of files, a Proof of SpaceTime (PoSt) scheme is implemented. Using a traffic proof algorithm PoF, CESS is able to measure and calculate the traffic bandwidth contributed by nodes. Finally, keeping in mind the fluctuation of the network environment, CESS uses a Proof of Available Storage scheme (PoAs) to verify that nodes have sufficient storage capacity and stability.

Using these technological breakthroughs, CESS is able to deliver unprecedented levels of data security and control, that too on a global scale fit for large consumption on an enterprise level.

CESS is designed from the ground up to be a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for fast, accessible, safe, and encrypted data storage – including hot, warm, and cold data. Thanks to these capabilities, CESS is reimagining what is possible in the cloud-based decentralized storage space and is quickly gaining traction as the go-to solution for leading Web3 applications that need transformative decentralized storage. Along the way, CESS is ushering in a decentralized storage revolution, much as Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (Amazon (NASDAQ: ) S3) transformed centralized cloud computing over the past 15 since its launch in 2006.

Kyoto is a city rich in history and has long been a friend to startup executives and investors – not to mention Web3 innovators and developers from all industries and verticals. This year’s conference featured over 10,000 attendees, 700+ speakers, over 250 sessions, and 100+ side events.

CESS’s Smart Cloud Space System maximizes scattered global storage space utilization as well and manages node disk space by regularly checking disk status, calculating available and used space, and clearing invalid data.

In this way, CESS is a secure, efficient, and scalable decentralized cloud storage network that provides data storage services and data sharing platforms for Web3. It is the first decentralized storage network that offers full-stack data solutions for large-scale commercial applications. As an open-sourced and public blockchain, CESS is positioned to be the underlying network infrastructure that is equipped with integrated APIs and SDK for easy dApps deployment. It supports WASM and is compatible with EVM smart contracts, making CESS widely available for large-scale commercial applications with its superior performance in data handling.

All incentives are guaranteed by a set of transparent and fair incentive mechanisms. Anyone can join CESS fairly to become candidate consensus miners through R²S, preventing large nodes from having a monopoly on the network. R²S also achieves low gas fees and 10,000 TPS.

CESS supports use cases such as customized network drives, frontend support, decentralized streaming and social media, decentralized data marketplaces, user-generated content platforms, and blockchain data backup hubs, helping to build a diverse and robust ecosystem where transactions are secured by encryption and data ownership is returned to their rightful owners."

2022-07-07, IANS,Amazon deforestation down by a third in 2022: Brazil,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-deforestation-down-by-a-third-in-2022-brazil-3714941,"Brasilia, July 7 (IANS) The Brazilian government has claimed that deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest has decreased by a third, ot 33.6 per cent, in the first six months since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's assumed office compared with the same period last year.The announcement was based on new satellite data presented by Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (Inpe) on Thursday, reports the BBC.

According to the Inpe, the rainforest shrank by 2,649 sq km from January to June this year, down from 3,988 sq km in those six months last year under former President Jair Bolsonaro.

The Institute singled out June as the month that saw a record 41 per cent drop in forest clearance compared with the same period last year.

""We have reached a steady downward trend in deforestation of the Amazon,"" the BBC quoted Environment Minister Marina Silva as saying to reporters.

Despite the positive report, the rainforest witnessed increasing fires.

In June alone, satellite monitoring detected 3,075 fires in the Amazon -- the highest number since 2007.

Many of the blazes -- releasing vast amounts of carbon emissions -- have been linked to the clearing of previously deforested areas.

Lula, who took office in January, has vowed to reverse policies of his far-right predecessor Bolsonaro, who promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon.

The President has also been pushing for the world's richest nations to pay for various initiatives aimed at saving the rainforest.

The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, and 60 per cent of it is in Brazil, the BBC reported.

Due to the large number of trees growing there, it is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" on account of how the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

The preliminary investigation found that the transaction may allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for the manufacturing and supply of RVCs and strengthen its position in the market for online marketplace services to third-party sellers (and related advertising services) and/or other data-related markets.

“Amazon is both an online marketplace and a retailer. We are concerned that, by acquiring iRobot, Amazon may use such a dual role to foreclose access by iRobot’s rivals to its marketplace,” said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy.

“With our in-depth investigation, we will also investigate whether Amazon would use data collected by iRobot to strengthen its position as an online marketplace provider,” she added.

The Commission now has 90 working days, until November 15, to make a decision.

The EU probe comes as the UK's antitrust regulator last month cleared Amazon's proposed $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that iRobot's market position in the supply of robot vacuum cleaners in the UK is modest and that it already faces several significant rivals.

2022-07-11, IANS,Amazon gears up with Shark Tank-type Prime TV series on Indian startups,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-gears-up-with-shark-tanktype-prime-tv-series-on-indian-startups-3718651,"New Delhi, July 11 (IANS) Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly launching a Shark Tank-type TV show on its Prime streaming service this week to empower promising startups in India.TechCrunch reported on Tuesday, citing people close to the development, that the Prime Video show is set to be unveiled as early as Wednesday, as the e-commerce giant gears up for its Prime Day over the coming weekend.

According to the report, the Prime startup series will showcase innovation from smaller cities and towns.

“The show will also see Amazon cut checks to startups through its India-focused $250 million SMBhav fund,” the report mentioned.

When reached out to Amazon India, the company did not immediately comment on the report.

Amazon India representatives are in touch with several angel investors and venture funds and Bollywood celebrities are also reported to be participating in the Prime Video series.

The Amazon Prime startup series comes on the heels of Shark Tank India, which has seen two seasons on Sony Entertainment Television.

The show is the Indian franchise of the American show Shark Tank. It shows entrepreneurs making business presentations to a panel of investors or sharks, who decide whether to invest in their company.

Amazon Prime Video is entering the startup arena at a time when the Indian startup ecosystem is going through a rough patch, amid sharp valuation cuts and job losses.

The Indian startup ecosystem reported the lowest six-month funding in the last four years, in the first half of this year, at $3.8 billion across 298 deals -- a decline of nearly 36 per cent as compared to the second half of 2022 ($5.9 billion), according to the latest PwC report.

There was no new unicorn in India in the first half of 2022 as startup funding plunged more than 70 per cent in the January-June period from a year ago, according to data by market intelligence firm Tracxn.

Prime Day is set to take place between the 11th and 12th of July, with customers gaining access to ""more deals than any past Prime Day,"" with new deals dropping every 30 minutes during select periods.

The analysts said that with Prime Day arriving at a time when many customers are bargain hunting due to elevated inflation and economic concerns impacting consumer spending, they ""expect strong demand for deals as CEO Jassy's comments on CNBC last week suggested that customers are trading down more frequently than in past quarters.""

""In our Prime Day model, we estimate 10% Y/Y 1P Prime Day sales growth and 14% 3P sales growth, with 1P GMV at $6.8bn and 3P GMV at $5.2bn,"" wrote the analysts. ""Our 12% Y/Y Prime Day GMV growth estimate translates to $11.95bn in total GMV for Prime Day (and is above our 10% GMV growth rate for 3Q). Based on our projection for $162bn in 3Q'23e Amazon GMV, we estimate Prime Day could represent 7.4% of GMV for the quarter (up slightly from 7.2% last year).""

For Q2 2022, the estimated earnings decline for the is -7.2%, which would mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020.

The focus of Wolfe’s analysts is on the Online Ads and eCommerce sector. Along these lines, the analysts highlight the following 5 stocks:

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) – Wolfe Research has an ""Outperform"" rating and a $150 per share price target on META shares. The analysts have “reasonable confidence” that Meta will deliver positive estimate revision in the second half of 2022. “META should report solid 2Q results with revenues coming at or near the high-end of the prior guidance range ($32B). Our checks with digital advertising agencies intra-quarter indicated strong trends in April, May, and early June driven by growth in ad budgets, improving ROIs, and incremental adoption of Advantage+ across a wider range of advertiser cohorts,” they said. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – The analysts hiked the price target on the ""Outperform""-rated Amazon stock by $10 to $150 per share. They see the upside potential for Amazon in the context of Q2 EBIT numbers. “We expect 2Q to be a healthy print for AMZN. We see a path for retail margins, specifically in North America, to expand steadily over the next few quarters. However, it likely takes a few more quarters until retail EBIT margin reaches pre-COVID levels,” they said. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) – Google shares also received a boost at Wolfe with the price target being raised to $140 per share. Still, Wolfe Research analysts seem less bullish on GOOGL than on META and AMZN. “We don’t see meaningful risks to GOOGL’s search revenue growth trajectory in the near-term. However, 2H margin risks (from potential ramp in hiring and other costs including NFL YT content deal) keep our excitement on GOOGL shares tempered NT.” Pinterest (NYSE: ) – The analysts are looking for signs of improving growth rates. They reiterated an ""Outperform"" rating on PINS and a $33 per share price target, while the stock remains “one of our top picks for 2H.” “We think the company is making steady progress on several long-term initiatives, the effect of which is somewhat masked by the impact of deceleration in discretionary consumer spending during 1Q.” MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) – The company is likely to report “strong top-line growth in commerce and fintech businesses in several key markets,” the analysts predict. Like PINS, MELI is also one of Wolfe’s Top Picks for 2H23. The new price target on MELI stock is $1400 per share, down from the prior $1700.

The stock with the largest upside potential in Wolfe’s research coverage of Online Ads and eCommerce companies is Pinterest (20%+)."

2022-07-09, Investing.com,This week in tech: Meta's meteoric Threads launch; Rivian's auspicious week,https://in.investing.com/news/this-week-in-tech-metas-meteoric-threads-launch-rivians-auspicious-week-3716422,"By Louis Juricic and Sarina Isaacs

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: Meta's massive Threads launch (and Twitter's lawsuit warning); a boost for Alibaba ; and radiant headlines for Rivian.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Meta's Threads app launches with a bang - and a legal threat

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Friday that its new Threads app - which some are calling the ""Twitter killer"" - had already amassed 70 million signups after its Wednesday-night launch, thanks in large part to its tremendous Instagram user base.

A day earlier, Twitter responded to the launch by threatening to sue Meta, according to a letter sent by Twitter attorney Alex Spiro that Semafor obtained.

The letter accuses Meta of attempting to create a ""copycat"" app by unlawfully poaching numerous ex-Twitter employees, then tasking these employees with developing the Threads app with the intention of utilizing Twitter's trade secrets and intellectual property in order to expedite the app's creation. The letter demands that Meta immediately cease use of that information.

Meta, via its communications director Andy Stone, posted on the new app that no one on the Threads team is a former Twitter employee.

Elon Musk tweeted, “competition is fine, cheating is not.”

Bank of America analysts said that Meta has a history of successfully replicating competitor apps without serious legal challenges, adding:

Until further facts surrounding the claim emerge or further steps are taken by either party, we anticipate that the current threat of legal action will have limited immediate impact on the ramp of the app. However, if Threads was to grow to a size similar to, or larger than, Twitter, we could see possibility of antitrust issues with cross platform data use.

Meta shares gained 2% for the week.







Alibaba pops on lower-than-anticipated China fine

U.S.-listed shares in Alibaba (NYSE: ) spiked 8% Friday after the Chinese government slapped its fintech arm Ant Group with a lower-than-expected 7.12 billion yuan fine ($985M). Alibaba's Hong Kong-traded shares (HK: ) closed up 3.4% for the session.

Reuters previously reported that Ant was set to be fined at least 8B yuan (roughly $1.1B).

The penalty - the biggest placed on a Chinese internet company since regulators fined ride-sharing app Didi Global (OTC: ) for $1.2B last year - concludes a multiyear revamp of Ant that was initiated by the People's Bank of China following the scrapping of the fintech firm's planned $37B flotation in 2020.

Ant said that it will “comply with the terms of the penalty in all earnestness and sincerity and continue to further enhance our compliance governance.”

The end of the overhaul could mean that Ant will be able to secure a financial holding company license and, potentially, bolster a revival of an initial public offering. Before the IPO was scuttled, some investors had valued Ant at over $300B.

Meanwhile, New York-listed shares of Alibaba peers Baidu (NASDAQ: ) and PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: ) each rose more than 3%.

Rivian's explosive week

Electric carmaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) soared last week on several pieces of good news: better-than-expected production numbers, word that Amazon (NASDAQ: ) will deploy its first Rivian vans in Europe, and warming sentiment among Wall Street analysts.

First, on Monday, Rivian surged more than 17% after the company said it produced 13,992 vehicles - a 59% year-over-year jump - overcoming Street expectations for 12,640. The company, which has been struggling with supply-chain hurdles, also reiterated its annual production target of 50,000 units.

Then, on Wednesday, Amazon said that 300 of the vehicles will take to the roads in a number of regions in Germany over the coming weeks, including Munich, Berlin, and Düsseldorf. They constitute Rivian's first commercial shipments outside of the U.S.

Amazon, which is also the largest shareholder in Rivian, had already ordered 100,000 of these vans and began to roll them out in several U.S. cities last year. By 2030, Amazon says it plans to have 100,000 Rivian vans in operation globally.

Amid the positive headlines, DA Davidson upgraded the stock to Neutral from Underperform, arguing that the entry into Europe came “far earlier than we anticipated.” The analyst added:

While 2Q deliveries were short of our model, they beat consensus expectations (a low bar, in our view). The recent ABRP acquisition adds new capabilities and valuable data as well.

Separately, Needham & Company added Rivian to its Conviction List and raised its price target to $28 from the prior $26. Mizuho kept its Buy rating on the stock, but cut its 12-month price target to $27 from the prior $30.

All told, Rivian shares rocketed about 52% for the week to $24.70.

Scott Kanowsky, Senad Karaahmetovic, Michael Elkins, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.

2022-07-08, IANS,Samsung Galaxy M34 5G: Offers feature-rich experience at affordable price,https://in.investing.com/news/samsung-galaxy-m34-5g-offers-featurerich-experience-at-affordable-price-3715900,"New Delhi, July 8 (IANS) Samsung (KS: ) has just launched its new smartphone Galaxy M34 5G in the country, which is a feature-packed smartphone providing a premium experience at an affordable price.The new smartphone comes with an impressive rear panel design, showcasing a distinctive camera setup adorned with three separate rings.

Furthermore, the handset's edges feature elegant curves, ensuring a comfortable and satisfying grip during use, even when playing games.

We used the Galaxy M34 5G in Midnight Blue colour for a week, specifically the 6GB+126GB variant. After thorough usage, here are our thoughts on Samsung's latest device.

When it comes to design, the M34 5G comes with a sleek and stylish design on the back. However, it's worth noting that without a back case, the phone tends to attract fingerprints quite easily, which can sometimes diminish its overall appearance.

On the front, the smartphone features a 6.5-inch Full HD+ Super AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The display provides a good viewing experience even in bright sunlight.

Now, let's dive into the camera capabilities of the Galaxy M34 5G. This smartphone is equipped with a triple-lens camera system on the rear. It houses a main 50 MP (OIS) No Shake camera and on the front, it features a 13 MP camera.

Overall, the smartphone's camera provides great performance for its price range, especially when capturing photos in well-lit environments.

It also comes with the Nightography feature which provides satisfying low-light shots.

The new smartphone comes packed with a large 6,000mAh battery, but it provides an average charging speed because it only supports 25W of fast charging.

It also comes with an interesting Fun Mode, which has 16 different in-built lens effects allowing customers to express themselves through their smartphone camera.

The new smartphone comes in three colours-- Midnight Blue, Prism and Waterfall Blue and is available for pre-order on Amazon (NASDAQ: ). As an introductory offer, Galaxy M34 5G will be available at an all-inclusive price of Rs 16,999 for the 6+128GB variant and Rs 18,999 for the 8+128GB variant with select bank cards.

Conclusion: The Samsung Galaxy M34 5G is an affordable smartphone that offers impressive camera capabilities, a vibrant display, long battery life and solid performance.

It is a good option for budget-conscious consumers as it provides excellent value for money and delivers a feature-rich experience that exceeds expectations in its price range.

2022-07-07, The News Crypto,CESS Presents at the Prestigious IVS 2022 Conference in Kyoto,https://in.investing.com/news/cess-presents-at-the-prestigious-ivs-2022-conference-in-kyoto-3715682,"Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (CESS), the 3rd-gen decentralized cloud-based data storage protocol built exclusively for Web3, has recently presented at IVS 2022 – the biggest and most influential startup conference in Japan. CESS Co-founder and Chairman Nick Zaldastani and COO and Co-Founder Jessie Dai both attended the event and shared opinions on decentralized storage, enterprise blockchain opportunities, and the impact of infrastructure on decentralization.

Issues pertaining to data ownership are a recurring theme and have grown in importance as the blockchain space has matured and evolved. Nick Zaldastani spoke in depth about how new changes in data ownership paradigms are drastically changing and improving legacy approaches to data storage:

“Decentralized storage is quickly becoming the bedrock of blockchain. Legacy systems and approaches no longer work in a Web3 world, and CESS was built to provide the scalability, stability, reliability, performance, cost-savings, and security demanded by new applications, systems, and platforms that depend on vast amounts of secure and accessible data of all kinds to function effectively. We were delighted to present at the conference and look forward to taking things to another level over the weeks and months to come.”

Jesse Dai also shared her thoughts on the event and said: “When compared with other Web3 storage projects, CESS offers unmatched storage costs, higher file reliability, more secure and efficient storage proofs, and lightning-fast upload and retrieval speeds. When taken together, these capabilities cement our project’s value proposition as the ideal partner for enterprises and projects that need speed, performance, and reliability in the fast-paced and dynamic world of Web3 applications and data. At IVS2022, we’ve had the opportunity to educate attendees about our offerings while networking with potential collaborators and partners and look forward to the next round of innovation, growth, and partnerships that will inevitably result from this high-profile conference.”

CESS is pioneering new innovations in decentralized storage that not only give complete ownership and control of user data back to users – in complete contrast to the approach of centralized platforms such as, for example, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and YouTube, where the platform typically owns and controls user data – and CESS also empowers users to permit or restrict access to their data to different entities and remove or scrub data from the Internet whenever and however they choose.

To do this, CESS uses a combination of groundbreaking tech innovations, including Multiple Data Storage Proof Schemes represented by Proof of Data Reduplication and Recovery (PoDR²), Proof of Replication (PoRep), Proof of Space-time (PoSt), Proof of Flow (PoF), Proof of Availability and Storage (PoAs). Other technologies include Multi-Format Data Rights Confirmation (MDRC) and Proxy Re-encryption Technology (PReT) to ensure data ownership and data privacy.

PoDR² is used to guarantee that the system always holds multiple copies of user data files for retrieval. PoRep guarantees that miners have replicated the data as assigned. In order to verify that data files remain on storage nodes during the contract period of files, a Proof of SpaceTime (PoSt) scheme is implemented. Using a traffic proof algorithm PoF, CESS is able to measure and calculate the traffic bandwidth contributed by nodes. Finally, keeping in mind the fluctuation of the network environment, CESS uses a Proof of Available Storage scheme (PoAs) to verify that nodes have sufficient storage capacity and stability.

Using these technological breakthroughs, CESS is able to deliver unprecedented levels of data security and control, that too on a global scale fit for large consumption on an enterprise level.

CESS is designed from the ground up to be a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solution for fast, accessible, safe, and encrypted data storage – including hot, warm, and cold data. Thanks to these capabilities, CESS is reimagining what is possible in the cloud-based decentralized storage space and is quickly gaining traction as the go-to solution for leading Web3 applications that need transformative decentralized storage. Along the way, CESS is ushering in a decentralized storage revolution, much as Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (Amazon (NASDAQ: ) S3) transformed centralized cloud computing over the past 15 since its launch in 2006.

Kyoto is a city rich in history and has long been a friend to startup executives and investors – not to mention Web3 innovators and developers from all industries and verticals. This year’s conference featured over 10,000 attendees, 700+ speakers, over 250 sessions, and 100+ side events.

2022-07-07, IANS,Amazon deforestation down by a third in 2022: Brazil,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-deforestation-down-by-a-third-in-2022-brazil-3714941,"Brasilia, July 7 (IANS) The Brazilian government has claimed that deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ: ) rainforest has decreased by a third, ot 33.6 per cent, in the first six months since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's assumed office compared with the same period last year.The announcement was based on new satellite data presented by Brazil's National Institute of Space Research (Inpe) on Thursday, reports the BBC.

According to the Inpe, the rainforest shrank by 2,649 sq km from January to June this year, down from 3,988 sq km in those six months last year under former President Jair Bolsonaro.

The Institute singled out June as the month that saw a record 41 per cent drop in forest clearance compared with the same period last year.

""We have reached a steady downward trend in deforestation of the Amazon,"" the BBC quoted Environment Minister Marina Silva as saying to reporters.

Despite the positive report, the rainforest witnessed increasing fires.

In June alone, satellite monitoring detected 3,075 fires in the Amazon -- the highest number since 2007.

Many of the blazes -- releasing vast amounts of carbon emissions -- have been linked to the clearing of previously deforested areas.

Lula, who took office in January, has vowed to reverse policies of his far-right predecessor Bolsonaro, who promoted mining in indigenous lands in the Amazon.

The President has also been pushing for the world's richest nations to pay for various initiatives aimed at saving the rainforest.

The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world, and 60 per cent of it is in Brazil, the BBC reported.

Due to the large number of trees growing there, it is often called ""the lungs of the planet"" on account of how the trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.

The preliminary investigation found that the transaction may allow Amazon to restrict competition in the market for the manufacturing and supply of RVCs and strengthen its position in the market for online marketplace services to third-party sellers (and related advertising services) and/or other data-related markets.

“Amazon is both an online marketplace and a retailer. We are concerned that, by acquiring iRobot, Amazon may use such a dual role to foreclose access by iRobot’s rivals to its marketplace,” said Margrethe Vestager, executive vice-president in charge of competition policy.

“With our in-depth investigation, we will also investigate whether Amazon would use data collected by iRobot to strengthen its position as an online marketplace provider,” she added.

The Commission now has 90 working days, until November 15, to make a decision.

The EU probe comes as the UK's antitrust regulator last month cleared Amazon's proposed $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that iRobot's market position in the supply of robot vacuum cleaners in the UK is modest and that it already faces several significant rivals.

Goldman Sachs is among the many research firms that call Jazz Pharma a buy - along with a $212 price target, a massive leap from its current price around $120. And when Goldman upgraded the stock this past December, its analysts cited Jazz’s “positive outlook on operating margin performance and the potential for multiple upside levers,” among them expansion of two of its drugs into non-U.S. markets.

After a 22% pullback from the start of the year, Jazz shares are currently trading at a heavy discount of a 6.1x forward price-to-earnings ratio. Fair value calculations from InvestingPro estimate 35% upside from current levels, while analysts polled by InvestingPro collectively expect the stock to rocket a whopping 64% from here, with zero underperform ratings among them.

In a 'Supplemental Privacy Policy,' Meta said that ""You may deactivate your Threads profile at any time, but your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.""

According to the social network, a Threads profile is an integral part of the user’s Instagram account. Instagram currently has more than 2 billion users globally and Threads, touted as a 'Twitter killer' is available in 100 countries, including in India, is billed as the next Twitter killer.

""Threads app stands out from other Twitter challengers by tapping into a ready user base potentially migrating from Instagram on Day Zero. With Mark Zuckerberg's proven execution skills, Threads has the potential to become a breakthrough alternative to Twitter,"" Prabhu Ram, head of Industry Intelligence Group (IIG) at CyberMedia Research (CMR), told IANS.

Even if they capture just a fraction of the Instagram user base, as little as a quarter, Threads could rival Twitter in audience size.

""While focusing on user growth initially, Threads is poised to attract advertisers as its user base expands,” said Ram. Some top brands like Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), NFL and Pepsi have expressed their vote of confidence in Threads by signing up to the app, according to reports.

Similar to Instagram, with Threads, users can follow and connect with friends and creators who share their interests, including the people they follow on Instagram.

Moreover, users under 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private profile when they join the app. Users can also control who can mention them or reply to them within Threads. Like on Instagram, users can add hidden words to filter out replies to their threads that contain specific words. They can also unfollow, block, restrict or report a profile on Threads by tapping the three-dot menu, and any accounts they have blocked on Instagram will automatically be blocked on Threads.

The company is also on the lookout for ""new partnerships and acquisitions in Europe and beyond"" in a bid to scale up its space services with launch and engine businesses, the Financial Times reported.

""We're looking for anything we can do to acquire, to scale up to better serve our customers,"" Bob Smith, chief executive, Blue Origin was quoted as saying.

""It's not a function of size -- rather how much it accelerates our road map of what we're trying to get done,"" he added.

The company is also looking at acquisitions and partnerships in areas from manufacturing to software and wants to expand services in new regions such as Europe.

While ""no location had yet been chosen"" for the new launch site…""I think there's a great opportunity in Europe,"" said Smith. ""It's far less clear to us how to actually sell space services in Europe than it is in the US.""

But Europe can open new avenues for Blue Origin as the continent is currently facing limited launch availability with the imminent retirement of the Ariane 5 rocket, and only two rockets remaining Ariane 6, which has yet to fly, and Vega-C.

Besides developing rockets and engines to take cargo and crew to space, Blue Origin is also leading a consortium to build a commercial space station. It was awarded a $3.4 billion NASA contract last month to build a lunar lander to take humans to the moon's surface, the report said.

Blue Origin's success has been with the New Shepard rocket which has aced 22 missions to suborbital space, including six crewed missions that carried 31 space tourists.

However, even after being the first company to successfully launch, land and reuse a rocket, it has been trailing against Rocket Lab and Elon Musk's SpaceX, which developed reliable rockets capable of carrying satellites and other payload into orbit.

Both have successfully carried out several crewed and unmanned missions to the International Space Station.

2022-07-05, Investing.com,Amazon Rolls Out First Electric Delivery Vans from Rivian in Europe,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-rolls-out-first-electric-delivery-vans-from-rivian-in-europe-432SI-3711627,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) today announced the arrival of its new custom electric delivery vans from Rivian (RIVN) in Europe, with the first vans rolling out in Germany. More than 300 electric delivery vans are hitting the road in Munich, Berlin, and Dusseldorf in the coming weeks, joining a fleet of thousands of electric vans already in operation in Europe, including more than 1,000 electric vans in Germany. Amazon announced last year that it plans to invest more than €1 billion to electrify its European transportation network and reduce carbon emissions over the coming years, including more than €400M in Germany.

“Together, Amazon and Rivian designed and built a state-of-the-art electric vehicle from the ground up, and unlike anything else on the road today,” said Neil Emery, Amazon, Director, Global Fleet & Product. “The safety and comfort of our drivers were top of mind for us throughout this process, and we’ve raised the bar on both with the vehicle we are rolling out in Europe today.”

“We’re thrilled to see the EDV rolling out in Germany today,” said Dagan Mishoulam, Vice President, Strategy & Go To Market, Rivian. “This vehicle was designed in conjunction with our partners at Amazon and not only puts driver convenience and safety first, but also the environment. We’ve had incredible feedback from drivers in the US and we're excited to start international expansion in Germany. Today is a real milestone for us as it also marks the first Rivian vehicles in Europe and we’re very excited about our future in the region.”

“Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, and reducing our delivery-related emissions is a critical part of this goal,” said Rocco Bräuniger, Country Manager for Amazon.de. “Last year we delivered more than 45 million packages in Germany with electric vans and e-cargo bikes, and these new additions from Rivian will help us deliver packages more sustainably and to more customers.”

Amazon began rolling out its custom electric delivery vans from Rivian in the U.S. last summer and already has more than 3,000 vans delivering packages in over 500 U.S. cities and regions. The company aims to have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian on the road globally by 2030, helping to save millions of metric tons of carbon per year.

Amazon’s custom electric delivery vans from Rivian are designed from the ground-up with safety, sustainability, and comfort in mind, and have been thoroughly tested by drivers in Germany. They are the product of Amazon’s partnership with Rivian, which the companies announced in 2019 when Amazon co-founded, and became the first signatory of The Climate Pledge—a commitment to reach net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040. As part of the pledge, Amazon is creating a more sustainable delivery fleet—and its work with Rivian is an important part of decarbonizing its last mile logistics as well as accelerating innovation that could help others reach net-zero carbon.

Amazon has been testing deliveries with Rivian preproduction vehicles in Europe since last year. This testing has allowed Rivian to continuously improve the vehicle’s performance, safety and durability in various climates and geographies as well as its state-of-the-art features to ensure driver satisfaction, and overall functionality. In Europe, Amazon and Rivian specially designed a shorter, thinner van than its U.S. counterpart in order to better fit in Europe’s cities.

The custom vehicles include innovative technology and features such as:

A safety-first design focused on superior 360-degree visibility, and vehicle features that protect drivers and pedestrians.

A suite of innovative safety features including a large windshield to enhance driver visibility, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and collision warnings.

First-of-its-kind embedded technology that fully integrates the delivery workflow with the vehicle, enabling seamless access to routing, navigation, driver support and more.

Features to enhance the driver experience, and create ease on the road such as automatic door locking/unlocking as the driver approaches or leaves the vehicle, and a powered bulkhead door that opens when drivers reach their delivery location.

A strengthened door on the driver’s side for additional protection, and an ergonomically designed driver’s cabin and cargo area for safe, and easy movement inside the van.

Batteries that are light, resilient, and low cost in addition to lasting the lifetime of the vehicle.

Amazon has added thousands of charging stations at its facilities across Europe, and will continue to invest in building an infrastructure to support a more sustainable delivery fleet.

In 2022, Amazon used zero-emission vehicles, including electric vans and micro-mobility solutions like e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, and walkers, to deliver more than 120 million packages to customers in Europe. The new vans from Rivian, along with the expansion of micro-mobility hubs across European cities, will help Amazon deliver even more packages in zero-emission vehicles."

Southern upgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs upgraded Southern (NYSE: ) to Conviction Buy from Buy with a price target of $80.00, expecting positive progress in the Vogtle Units 3 and 4 nuclear project, leading to increased earnings growth and value.

2 more upgrades

ACM Research (NASDAQ: ) shares closed with more than a 13% gain yesterday after Jefferies upgraded the company to Buy from Hold with its price target of $23.40 (from $9), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

The rating change is based on looser DUV rules lifting China's fab CapEx.

Wolfe Research upgraded Lazard (NYSE: ) to Peer Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $32 from $28.

The firm expressed caution about Lazard shares for a while due to concerns that the market was underestimating headwinds related to revenue and comparable sales. However, considering that the shares are trading at a significant discount compared to their peers, the firm now sees risk/reward as more balanced.

In a 'Supplemental Privacy Policy,' Meta said that ""You may deactivate your Threads profile at any time, but your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.""

According to the social network, a Threads profile is an integral part of the user’s Instagram account. Instagram currently has more than 2 billion users globally and Threads, touted as a 'Twitter killer' is available in 100 countries, including in India, is billed as the next Twitter killer.

""Threads app stands out from other Twitter challengers by tapping into a ready user base potentially migrating from Instagram on Day Zero. With Mark Zuckerberg's proven execution skills, Threads has the potential to become a breakthrough alternative to Twitter,"" Prabhu Ram, head of Industry Intelligence Group (IIG) at CyberMedia Research (CMR), told IANS.

Even if they capture just a fraction of the Instagram user base, as little as a quarter, Threads could rival Twitter in audience size.

""We're looking for anything we can do to acquire, to scale up to better serve our customers,"" Bob Smith, chief executive, Blue Origin was quoted as saying.

""It's not a function of size -- rather how much it accelerates our road map of what we're trying to get done,"" he added.

The company is also looking at acquisitions and partnerships in areas from manufacturing to software and wants to expand services in new regions such as Europe.

While ""no location had yet been chosen"" for the new launch site…""I think there's a great opportunity in Europe,"" said Smith. ""It's far less clear to us how to actually sell space services in Europe than it is in the US.""

But Europe can open new avenues for Blue Origin as the continent is currently facing limited launch availability with the imminent retirement of the Ariane 5 rocket, and only two rockets remaining Ariane 6, which has yet to fly, and Vega-C.

Besides developing rockets and engines to take cargo and crew to space, Blue Origin is also leading a consortium to build a commercial space station. It was awarded a $3.4 billion NASA contract last month to build a lunar lander to take humans to the moon's surface, the report said.

Blue Origin's success has been with the New Shepard rocket which has aced 22 missions to suborbital space, including six crewed missions that carried 31 space tourists.

However, even after being the first company to successfully launch, land and reuse a rocket, it has been trailing against Rocket Lab and Elon Musk's SpaceX, which developed reliable rockets capable of carrying satellites and other payload into orbit.

Both have successfully carried out several crewed and unmanned missions to the International Space Station.

2022-07-05, Investing.com,Amazon Rolls Out First Electric Delivery Vans from Rivian in Europe,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-rolls-out-first-electric-delivery-vans-from-rivian-in-europe-432SI-3711627,"Amazon (NASDAQ: ) today announced the arrival of its new custom electric delivery vans from Rivian (RIVN) in Europe, with the first vans rolling out in Germany. More than 300 electric delivery vans are hitting the road in Munich, Berlin, and Dusseldorf in the coming weeks, joining a fleet of thousands of electric vans already in operation in Europe, including more than 1,000 electric vans in Germany. Amazon announced last year that it plans to invest more than €1 billion to electrify its European transportation network and reduce carbon emissions over the coming years, including more than €400M in Germany.

“Together, Amazon and Rivian designed and built a state-of-the-art electric vehicle from the ground up, and unlike anything else on the road today,” said Neil Emery, Amazon, Director, Global Fleet & Product. “The safety and comfort of our drivers were top of mind for us throughout this process, and we’ve raised the bar on both with the vehicle we are rolling out in Europe today.”

“We’re thrilled to see the EDV rolling out in Germany today,” said Dagan Mishoulam, Vice President, Strategy & Go To Market, Rivian. “This vehicle was designed in conjunction with our partners at Amazon and not only puts driver convenience and safety first, but also the environment. We’ve had incredible feedback from drivers in the US and we're excited to start international expansion in Germany. Today is a real milestone for us as it also marks the first Rivian vehicles in Europe and we’re very excited about our future in the region.”

“Amazon is committed to reaching net-zero carbon by 2040, and reducing our delivery-related emissions is a critical part of this goal,” said Rocco Bräuniger, Country Manager for Amazon.de. “Last year we delivered more than 45 million packages in Germany with electric vans and e-cargo bikes, and these new additions from Rivian will help us deliver packages more sustainably and to more customers.”

Amazon began rolling out its custom electric delivery vans from Rivian in the U.S. last summer and already has more than 3,000 vans delivering packages in over 500 U.S. cities and regions. The company aims to have 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian on the road globally by 2030, helping to save millions of metric tons of carbon per year.

Amazon’s custom electric delivery vans from Rivian are designed from the ground-up with safety, sustainability, and comfort in mind, and have been thoroughly tested by drivers in Germany. They are the product of Amazon’s partnership with Rivian, which the companies announced in 2019 when Amazon co-founded, and became the first signatory of The Climate Pledge—a commitment to reach net-zero carbon across its operations by 2040. As part of the pledge, Amazon is creating a more sustainable delivery fleet—and its work with Rivian is an important part of decarbonizing its last mile logistics as well as accelerating innovation that could help others reach net-zero carbon.

Amazon has been testing deliveries with Rivian preproduction vehicles in Europe since last year. This testing has allowed Rivian to continuously improve the vehicle’s performance, safety and durability in various climates and geographies as well as its state-of-the-art features to ensure driver satisfaction, and overall functionality. In Europe, Amazon and Rivian specially designed a shorter, thinner van than its U.S. counterpart in order to better fit in Europe’s cities.

The custom vehicles include innovative technology and features such as:

A safety-first design focused on superior 360-degree visibility, and vehicle features that protect drivers and pedestrians.

A suite of innovative safety features including a large windshield to enhance driver visibility, automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and collision warnings.

First-of-its-kind embedded technology that fully integrates the delivery workflow with the vehicle, enabling seamless access to routing, navigation, driver support and more.

Features to enhance the driver experience, and create ease on the road such as automatic door locking/unlocking as the driver approaches or leaves the vehicle, and a powered bulkhead door that opens when drivers reach their delivery location.

A strengthened door on the driver’s side for additional protection, and an ergonomically designed driver’s cabin and cargo area for safe, and easy movement inside the van.

Batteries that are light, resilient, and low cost in addition to lasting the lifetime of the vehicle.

Amazon has added thousands of charging stations at its facilities across Europe, and will continue to invest in building an infrastructure to support a more sustainable delivery fleet.

In 2022, Amazon used zero-emission vehicles, including electric vans and micro-mobility solutions like e-cargo bikes, e-scooters, and walkers, to deliver more than 120 million packages to customers in Europe. The new vans from Rivian, along with the expansion of micro-mobility hubs across European cities, will help Amazon deliver even more packages in zero-emission vehicles."

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Amazon initiated with a Buy rating

DBS Group initiated coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) with a Buy rating and a price target of $150.00, highlighting the company’s leading position in e-commerce, its growing prime membership base, and growth opportunities for both AWS and its online advertising business.

According to the firm, Amazon’s retail segment is still attempting to regain profitability after facing challenges from macroeconomic factors. The US e-commerce industry is projected to grow at 12.4% CAGR, reaching 20% of total retail sales by 2025 (vs. 13.5% in 2022). Amazon holds a 39% market share in US e-commerce and has opportunities to capture more of the untapped market.

The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on July 27. Street estimates stand at $0.35 for EPS and $131.16 billion for revenues.

Southern upgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs upgraded Southern (NYSE: ) to Conviction Buy from Buy with a price target of $80.00, expecting positive progress in the Vogtle Units 3 and 4 nuclear project, leading to increased earnings growth and value.

According to the firm, the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which introduced the nuclear production tax credit (PTC), reduced risks associated with this asset class, making nuclear power a catalyst for growth.

2 more upgrades

ACM Research (NASDAQ: ) shares closed with more than a 13% gain yesterday after Jefferies upgraded the company to Buy from Hold with its price target of $23.40 (from $9), as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

The rating change is based on looser DUV rules lifting China's fab CapEx.

Wolfe Research upgraded Lazard (NYSE: ) to Peer Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $32 from $28.

The firm expressed caution about Lazard shares for a while due to concerns that the market was underestimating headwinds related to revenue and comparable sales. However, considering that the shares are trading at a significant discount compared to their peers, the firm now sees risk/reward as more balanced.

There are several categories of dark pattern practices on e-commerce platforms which the government has identified. Some examples of these are false urgency, wherein the consumer is induced to purchase something under the pressure of being given a limited time offer on a particular product. Another example is that of ""confirm shaming"", where the consumer is lured by questions like ""are you sure you don't want to buy?""

Hidden cost is one of the common forms of such malpractice, where an online ticket is offered at a reduced rate but when it is purchased, the price is much more than it was offered earlier.

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

""Specifically, Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions,"" read the FTC complaint.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tesla downgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $248.00 (from $185.00) following a massive rally (up 108% YTD) in the EV maker's stock. Shares fell nearly 2% premarket today.

According to the firm, its view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets, is now better reflected in the stock. While the rating change was mostly driven by valuation, the bank also noted a difficult pricing environment for new vehicles, which it believes will hurt Tesla’s non-GAAP gross margin in 2022.

This represents the fourth downgrade this month for Tesla.

UBS downgraded Alphabet , sees better risk-reward in Meta and Amazon

UBS downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $132.00 (from $123.00), as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

The firm’s decision to move to the sidelines is based on several factors. These include limited upside potential to the current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates, medium-term revenue risk, the possibility of operating income margin expansion being offset by GenAI investments, and the perception of better risk-reward opportunities in other stocks, specifically Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ).

2 more downgrades

Celanese (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after BMO Capital downgraded the company to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $119.00 from $133.00 as end market weakness is likely to persist.

Viatris (NASDAQ: ) shares fell nearly 3% on Friday after Barclays downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $11.00.

The analysts highlight 4 key reasons why he is moving to the sidelines:

Limited upside to current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates; Medium-term revenue risk; Operating income margin expansion could be offset by GenAI investments; and Better risk-reward in other stocks, namely Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

On the competition front, the analysts still don’t see Bing or ChatGPT as “major threats” given the superiority of Search.

“We see some tail risk that Meta's AI chat could gain traction given the scale of users across its apps but we view this as more speculative. Our original concerns around the cost of GenAI have moderated, though near-term risk remains and the co did increase capex guidance last quarter and flagged a mix skew towards (faster depreciating) technical infrastructure. As such, while we view both the cost and competitive risks as less severe, some element of these risks remain,” they said in a note.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tesla downgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $248.00 (from $185.00) following a massive rally (up 108% YTD) in the EV maker's stock. Shares fell nearly 2% premarket today.

According to the firm, its view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets, is now better reflected in the stock. While the rating change was mostly driven by valuation, the bank also noted a difficult pricing environment for new vehicles, which it believes will hurt Tesla’s non-GAAP gross margin in 2022.

This represents the fourth downgrade this month for Tesla.

UBS downgraded Alphabet , sees better risk-reward in Meta and Amazon

UBS downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $132.00 (from $123.00), as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

The firm’s decision to move to the sidelines is based on several factors. These include limited upside potential to the current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates, medium-term revenue risk, the possibility of operating income margin expansion being offset by GenAI investments, and the perception of better risk-reward opportunities in other stocks, specifically Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ).

2 more downgrades

Celanese (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after BMO Capital downgraded the company to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $119.00 from $133.00 as end market weakness is likely to persist.

Viatris (NASDAQ: ) shares fell nearly 3% on Friday after Barclays downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $11.00.

The analysts highlight 4 key reasons why he is moving to the sidelines:

Limited upside to current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates; Medium-term revenue risk; Operating income margin expansion could be offset by GenAI investments; and Better risk-reward in other stocks, namely Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

On the competition front, the analysts still don’t see Bing or ChatGPT as “major threats” given the superiority of Search.

“We see some tail risk that Meta's AI chat could gain traction given the scale of users across its apps but we view this as more speculative. Our original concerns around the cost of GenAI have moderated, though near-term risk remains and the co did increase capex guidance last quarter and flagged a mix skew towards (faster depreciating) technical infrastructure. As such, while we view both the cost and competitive risks as less severe, some element of these risks remain,” they said in a note.

Alphabet shares are down over 1.5% in premarket Monday."

Amazon has invested about $11 billion in India so far and has plans to invest nearly $15 billion more by 2030.

""Productive meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Discussed Amazon's commitment to invest $26 billion in India by 2030,"" Jassy tweeted after meeting PM Modi who concluded his three-day state visit to the US on Friday.

""Working together, we will support startups, create jobs, enable exports, and empower individuals and small businesses to compete globally,"" the Amazon CEO added.

India is a key market for Amazon, where it has invested over $6.5 billion in e-commerce in the last decade.

In May this year, Amazon Web Services (AWS), the Cloud arm of e-commerce giant Amazon, announced plans to invest Rs 1,05,600 crore ($12.7 billion) into cloud infrastructure in India by 2030 to meet growing customer demand for cloud services in the country.

This investment is estimated to contribute Rs 1,94,700 crore ($23.3 billion) to India's total gross domestic product (GDP) by 2030.

The fresh investment followed AWS's investment of Rs 30,900 crore ($3.7 billion) between 2016-2022, which will bring AWS's total investment in India to Rs 1,36,500 crore ($16.4 billion) by 2030.

AWS has two data centre infrastructure regions in India -- the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region, launched in 2016, and the AWS Asia Pacific (Hyderabad) Region, launched in November 2022.

""Last qtr MSFT noted FQ1 (Sept.) is when Azure starts to lap optimization headwinds,"" wrote analysts.

""While encouraging for cloud, we view MSFT as best positioned for a few key reasons: 1) broad portfolio across productivity, cyber, cloud, etc. presents compelling offset/room to negotiate in consolidation-focused IT backdrop; 2) gaining share from traditional industries — slower to move, but bring significant scale + MSFT IT bias; 3) early AI leadership — brings incremental interest to Azure.""

Analysts noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth will likely accelerate in August due to lapping 2022 customer spend rationalization.

""We are tactically positive on the AWS business given 2H re-acceleration potential, but see mkt share trend vs. Azure obscuring longer-term optimism,"" added analysts. ""Biggest overhang appears to be lack of execution around AI / LLM opportunity—we believe AWS capabilities similar to Azure but product not being bundled/productized to make easy purchase for CTOs."""

Business Insider reported that Netflix also considered buying MGM before Amazon (NASDAQ: ) spent $8.5 billion on this acquisition. This report comes after Bloomberg reported last year that Netflix is exploring a deal to acquire Paramount Pictures, the company’s film studio.

“We've always viewed Paramount Studios (and PARA's CBS Studio) as a rare gem that, if put up for sale, could garner significant M&A interest from streamers; however, we're not convinced PARA would break-up and sell,” the analysts said in a client note.

They estimate that Paramount’s studios business could be worth around $30B, which suggests an upside to the current stock price after accounting for debt.

However, the analysts remain bearish on Paramount as they don’t suspect that Netflix has “any interest in PARA in its entirety so we're suspect of an all-out takeout of PARA.”

Wells Fargo analysts reaffirm their view that the bull case on PARA is a sale or break-up."

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

""Specifically, Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions,"" read the FTC complaint.

Amazon Prime costs $139 per year and gives consumers access to free two-day shipping, along with access to Prime Video and music streaming.

""Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,"" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement.

""These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike. The FTC will continue to vigorously protect Americans from ""dark patterns"" and other unfair or deceptive practices in digital markets,"" she added.

During Amazon's online checkout process, consumers were faced with numerous opportunities to subscribe to Amazon Prime at $14.99/month.

In many cases, the option to purchase items on Amazon without subscribing to Prime was more difficult for consumers to locate.

""In some cases, the button presented to consumers to complete their transaction did not clearly state that in choosing that option they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription,"" said the FTC.

The FTC has been investigating Amazon Prime's sign-up and cancellation processes since 2021.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

""The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,"" the spokesperson said.

""We also find it concerning that the FTC announced this lawsuit without notice to us, in the midst of our discussions with FTC staff members to ensure they understand the facts, context, and legal issues, and before we were able to have a dialog with the Commissioners themselves before they filed a lawsuit.

""While the absence of that normal course engagement is extremely disappointing, we look forward to proving our case in court,"" the spokesperson added.

Powell is set to deliver his second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The hawkish comments contrasted with that of other fed members including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Atlantic Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, both of whom towed a more cautious line on the need to rapidly return to rate hikes.

Bostic warned of that pressing on with additional rate hikes could “needlessly drain too much momentum from the economy.” While Goolsbee said he was still undecided on whether to resume hikes next month.

The analysts argue that a run-up in shares is a result of several factors, including improving profitability, an AWS recovery in sight, and the perception of long-term AI tailwinds.

“We see AMZN as a core beneficiary from the rise of AI as AWS benefits from increased usage to train and run AI models. While AMZN lags behind its mega-cap peers in generative AI capabilities today, the AI opportunity remains early, and we expect AMZN's rich history of innovation will help them close the AI gap over time,” they said in a note.

Moreover, the analysts see upside potential relative to consensus, which should help the stock to rally further.

“AMZN continues to improve profitability through cost rationalization and improved efficiency, driving an expected inflection in Operating Margin in '23 to 3.9% (from 2.4% in '22). We expect increased cost efficiencies will continue to drive the margin recovery and support positive Operating Income estimate revisions through 2024 as AMZN grows into its overbuilt logistics capacity.”

""Last qtr MSFT noted FQ1 (Sept.) is when Azure starts to lap optimization headwinds,"" wrote analysts.

""While encouraging for cloud, we view MSFT as best positioned for a few key reasons: 1) broad portfolio across productivity, cyber, cloud, etc. presents compelling offset/room to negotiate in consolidation-focused IT backdrop; 2) gaining share from traditional industries — slower to move, but bring significant scale + MSFT IT bias; 3) early AI leadership — brings incremental interest to Azure.""

Analysts noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS) growth will likely accelerate in August due to lapping 2022 customer spend rationalization.

""We are tactically positive on the AWS business given 2H re-acceleration potential, but see mkt share trend vs. Azure obscuring longer-term optimism,"" added analysts. ""Biggest overhang appears to be lack of execution around AI / LLM opportunity—we believe AWS capabilities similar to Azure but product not being bundled/productized to make easy purchase for CTOs."""

Business Insider reported that Netflix also considered buying MGM before Amazon (NASDAQ: ) spent $8.5 billion on this acquisition. This report comes after Bloomberg reported last year that Netflix is exploring a deal to acquire Paramount Pictures, the company’s film studio.

“We've always viewed Paramount Studios (and PARA's CBS Studio) as a rare gem that, if put up for sale, could garner significant M&A interest from streamers; however, we're not convinced PARA would break-up and sell,” the analysts said in a client note.

They estimate that Paramount’s studios business could be worth around $30B, which suggests an upside to the current stock price after accounting for debt.

However, the analysts remain bearish on Paramount as they don’t suspect that Netflix has “any interest in PARA in its entirety so we're suspect of an all-out takeout of PARA.”

The complaint, filed in the federal court in the US city of Seattle, said that for years, Amazon has ""knowingly duped millions of consumers into unknowingly enrolling in its Amazon Prime service"".

""Specifically, Amazon used manipulative, coercive, or deceptive user-interface designs known as 'dark patterns' to trick consumers into enrolling in automatically-renewing Prime subscriptions,"" read the FTC complaint.

Amazon Prime costs $139 per year and gives consumers access to free two-day shipping, along with access to Prime Video and music streaming.

""Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,"" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in a statement.

""These manipulative tactics harm consumers and law-abiding businesses alike. The FTC will continue to vigorously protect Americans from ""dark patterns"" and other unfair or deceptive practices in digital markets,"" she added.

During Amazon's online checkout process, consumers were faced with numerous opportunities to subscribe to Amazon Prime at $14.99/month.

In many cases, the option to purchase items on Amazon without subscribing to Prime was more difficult for consumers to locate.

""In some cases, the button presented to consumers to complete their transaction did not clearly state that in choosing that option they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription,"" said the FTC.

The FTC has been investigating Amazon Prime's sign-up and cancellation processes since 2021.

An Amazon spokesperson said that the FTC's claims are false on the facts and the law.

""The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,"" the spokesperson said.

""We also find it concerning that the FTC announced this lawsuit without notice to us, in the midst of our discussions with FTC staff members to ensure they understand the facts, context, and legal issues, and before we were able to have a dialog with the Commissioners themselves before they filed a lawsuit.

""While the absence of that normal course engagement is extremely disappointing, we look forward to proving our case in court,"" the spokesperson added.

Powell is set to deliver his second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The hawkish comments contrasted with that of other fed members including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Atlantic Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, both of whom towed a more cautious line on the need to rapidly return to rate hikes.

Bostic warned of that pressing on with additional rate hikes could “needlessly drain too much momentum from the economy.” While Goolsbee said he was still undecided on whether to resume hikes next month.

The analysts argue that a run-up in shares is a result of several factors, including improving profitability, an AWS recovery in sight, and the perception of long-term AI tailwinds.

“We see AMZN as a core beneficiary from the rise of AI as AWS benefits from increased usage to train and run AI models. While AMZN lags behind its mega-cap peers in generative AI capabilities today, the AI opportunity remains early, and we expect AMZN's rich history of innovation will help them close the AI gap over time,” they said in a note.

Moreover, the analysts see upside potential relative to consensus, which should help the stock to rally further.

“AMZN continues to improve profitability through cost rationalization and improved efficiency, driving an expected inflection in Operating Margin in '23 to 3.9% (from 2.4% in '22). We expect increased cost efficiencies will continue to drive the margin recovery and support positive Operating Income estimate revisions through 2024 as AMZN grows into its overbuilt logistics capacity.”

US FTC seeks court intervention to halt Microsoft's acquisition of Activision

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requested a court to temporarily halt Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), according to a Reuters report last Monday.

The FTC expressed concern that Microsoft and Activision were indicating the deal's imminent closure, possibly by Friday, and thus urged a federal judge to prevent any final agreement before that time.

The temporary halt to the acquisition had been granted by a U.S. judge on Tuesday in response to the FTC's request, with a hearing scheduled for this week.

The FTC argued that such a deal would grant Microsoft the ability and a heightened incentive to restrict Activision's content in ways that significantly reduce competition. In early December, the FTC, responsible for enforcing antitrust law, had already approached an in-house administrative judge to block the transaction on antitrust grounds. Their contention was that it would grant Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's (NYSE: ) PlayStation at a disadvantage.

Microsoft president Brad Smith expressed his willingness to present their case in federal court. Activision did not comment.

Broadcom/VMware $61 billion deal likely receives EU approval

VMware (NYSE: ) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) shares surged 4% and 6% last Monday after Reuters reported that Broadcom is likely to receive conditional approval from the EU antitrust authority for its planned purchase of VMware, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The approval from the European Commission is contingent upon Broadcom implementing measures to ensure interoperability with competitors, sources said.

Both Broadcom and the EU antitrust watchdog declined to provide any comments on the matter.

iRobot stock jumps 21% after UK CMA approves Amazon’s acquisition

The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has approved Amazon's (NASDAQ: ) $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot (NASDAQ: ). As a result iRobot shares jumped more than 21% on Friday.

The CMA conducted an investigation and determined that the deal does not raise competition concerns in the UK. However, the acquisition is still under review by regulators in other jurisdictions. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has requested documents from both companies to further assess the purpose and rationale of the deal. iRobot has stated that the companies will cooperate with the FTC investigation, which typically takes about a year.

2 more merger deals

(NASDAQ: ) announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Adenza from the private equity giant Thoma Bravo, as InvestingPro reported in real time. The deal, first rumored by the Wall Street Journal early Monday last week, will have NASDAQ pay a total of $10.5B in cash and stock.

Patterson-UTI Energy (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped more than 12% on Thursday following the announcement that it had entered into a merger agreement with NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NYSE: ) to combine in an all-stock merger of equals.

Under the terms of the $5.4B deal, NexTier shareholders will receive 0.7520 shares of Patterson-UTI common stock for each share of NexTier common stock. Upon closing, Patterson-UTI shareholders will own 55% and NexTier shareholders will own 45% of the combined company.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found that iRobot's market position in the supply of robot vacuum cleaners in the UK is modest and that it already faces several significant rivals.

""On this basis, the CMA considered that the loss of potential competition from Amazon wouldn't have a substantial impact on market outcomes,"" it said in a statement.

The acquisition of iRobot would not disadvantage Amazon's rival 'smart home' platforms.

""This is primarily because robot vacuum cleaners (and the data that they gather) are generally not considered to be an important input to the emerging ""smart home"" market in the UK,"" said the CMA.

The CMA also found that there are, in any case, several alternative robot vacuum cleaners with similar capabilities to iRobot that could form part of rival ""smart home"" offerings.

""More people are choosing to use 'smart' tech in their homes - whether that's listening to the radio through a smart speaker, answering the door using a video doorbell, or keeping floors clean with robot vacuum cleaners,"" said Colin Raftery, Senior Director of Mergers at the CMA.

""Here, after a thorough investigation, we're satisfied that the deal would have no impact on competition in the UK,"" the CMA added.

U.S.-based customers can still withdraw their funds during this period.

Binance, Binance.US and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed an agreement to limit customer funds only to Binance.US employees in the short term.

Binance recently asked the court to deny the U.S. SEC’s request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) since it would effectively put the company out of business. The regulator expressed its concern that if a TRO was not obtained, funds may be transferred overseas or documents erased.

The judge referred both the SEC and Binance to a magistrate judge to sort out a compromise. This was to protect customer funds without winding down the exchange. The move allows the exchange to avoid freezing all of Binance.US’s assets.

Binance.US will take precautions to ensure that no authorities from Binance Holdings have access to private keys for its different wallets, hardware wallets, or root access to its Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS) tools. Furthermore, the crypto trading platform will publish full information about its operational expenses, including expected costs, in upcoming weeks.

Other provisions in the proposed agreement will require Binance.US to create new crypto wallets inaccessible to the employees of its global exchange unit, give additional information to the SEC and agree to an expedited discovery timeline.

U.S.-based customers can still withdraw their funds during this period.

No relief in sight for now The SEC charged Binance, Binance.US and Zhao for allegedly violating securities laws in the U.S. According to the regulatory authority, the firms operated as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearinghouse all in one, allowing U.S. consumers to trade in tokens.

The regulator also alleged that Binance and CZ could access customer funds, moving millions to CZ-owned enterprises such as Merit Peak and Sigma Chain.

Binance had already dismissed these allegations. The proposed agreement still needs signing off from the federal judge overseeing the case."

”Only one round of inflation and labor market data will be released between now and the July meeting, and the unreliability of the monthly numbers means that policy decisions, in our view, should not be determined by such short runs,” it added.

According to an AWS executive, the world's largest cloud computing company is considering AMD's latest AI technology - potentially boosting AMD's inroads into the market currently dominated by rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - but is yet to make a final decision.

Either company is yet to make an official comment, although AWS's VP of elastic compute cloud Dave Brown did confirm there are negotiations: ""We're still working together on where exactly that will land between AWS and AMD, but it's something that our teams are working together on.""

AMD recently held an event where the company outlined its AI strategy and unveiled its newest AI products. The company disclosed the specs of its upcoming AI chip, which, 'on paper,' outperforms Nvidia's current best offerings, although it did not name any major clients for the product, leaving investors in the unknown.

Shares of AMD are gaining around 1.7% in pre-market on Wednesday following the announcement, extending an over 94% gain YTD.

1. Final countdown to Fed decision

The is set to deliver a fresh monetary policy announcement following the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, with investors keen to find out if the central bank will push pause on its long-running rate-hiking cycle or increase borrowing costs further.

Most estimates point to the former, particularly after data on Tuesday showed that headline inflation growth in the world's largest economy cooled by more than expected in May. At 4.0% on an annual basis, the stood at its lowest level since early 2021 and has now eased for eleven months straight.

But the figure is still well above the Fed's stated 2% target and the labor market is displaying signs of strength, suggesting that while Fed officials may choose to halt rate increases, they may flag that the move is only temporary.

2. Futures mixed with Fed announcement ahead

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the latest policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

3. Federal court temporarily blocks Microsoft-Activision merger

A federal court in California has ruled in favor of a request from U.S. antitrust regulators to place a temporary block on the completion of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) massive $69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ).

The FTC had previously asked the court to order a preliminary injunction on a final tie-up until after the agency has carried out its own administrative review -- due to start later this year -- over the legality of the deal.

A judge in a U.S. district court in California subsequently placed the merger on hold pending a two-day evidentiary hearing next week. At that hearing, a federal court will choose whether the preliminary injunction is warranted.

The FTC has already signaled that it believes the deal, the largest ever in the video games industry, will lessen competition. Microsoft has disagreed, saying it will be a boon for both gamers and companies alike.

Microsoft and Activision must submit their legal arguments against the preliminary injunction by Friday. The FTC will then have until June 20 to respond.

4. Nvidia closes with over $1T valuation

Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) edged up in premarket dealmaking after a milestone session that saw the chipmaking giant's valuation end the trading day at above $1T for the first time.

California-based Nvidia first cracked the vaunted Trillion Dollar Club late last month, when the stock price surpassed the threshold level of $404.87. However, they had yet to close above that mark until yesterday.

The company has been a massive beneficiary of a boom in interest in artificial intelligence, with the graphics cards maker saying that it expects the trend to power robust demand. The optimism has helped spur other firms with links to automated technology.

Nvidia is one of a number of major tech industry players, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft, to reach a trillion-dollar valuation.

5. Shell outlines plan to boost dividend

Shell (LON: ) has said it will aim to lift its dividend and cut spending as chief executive Wael Sawan looks to restore wavering investor confidence in the business through ""performance, discipline and simplification.""

Europe's largest energy company said it will raise overall shareholder distributions to 30% to 40% of cash flow from operations, up from its prior level of 20% to 30%. As a part of this plan, Shell will bump up its dividend by 15% from the second quarter, while the rate of share buybacks will go up to at least $5B for the second half of 2022.

Meanwhile, capital expenditures will be slashed to $22B to $25B per year for 2024 and 2025, down from a range of $23B to $27B planned for this year.

Shell will present these proposals at an investor conference in New York later today. According to Reuters, Sawan has been keen to support the company's stock price at a time when shareholders have been skeptical of its plans to shift away from oil and gas in favor of its renewables and low-carbon businesses."

2022-06-13, Bloomberg,"Opera Workers’ Ruling Offers Path for Uber, Lyft Drivers to Unionize",https://in.investing.com/news/opera-workers-ruling-offers-path-for-uber-lyft-drivers-to-unionize-3683696,"(Bloomberg) -- A US labor board ruling on Tuesday laid the groundwork for drivers from Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc. and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: ). and other gig workers to formally unionize – a still difficult but potentially transformative task.

In a ruling concerning workers at the Atlanta Opera (NASDAQ: ), the National Labor Relations Board’s Democratic majority voted to make it easier for workers to prove they’re employees rather than independent contractors, granting them the right to organize.

“Applying this clear standard will ensure that workers who seek to organize or exercise their rights under the National Labor Relations Act are not improperly excluded from its protections,” NLRB Chairman Lauren McFerran said in a statement.

While the decision directly involves hair and makeup workers at the opera, it also changes the precedent for who should be considered an employee at companies throughout the economy. The new ruling is likely to embolden workers at companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash Inc. to pursue cases, arguing they are also employees with union rights.

Gig company executives have argued that the flexibility they offer workers and the prices they offer consumers depend on their ability to keep classifying their workers as non-employees. Even with the opera precedent, the companies can try to persuade the government that their workers still qualify as contractors, as they have tried to do in states that passed laws cracking down on contractor misclassification. And even if gig workers are deemed to be employees, labor organizers might struggle to sign up enough workers to petition for a unionization election and win the ensuing vote.

Labor advocates have long complained that US labor law lets companies deploy aggressive tactics to defeat organizing drives — such as holding mandatory anti-union meetings about how unionizing could harm them — and provides only weak penalties for companies that illegally retaliate. The nature of jobs like ride-hailing, in which drivers largely work alone and with varying schedules and locations, can make organizing particularly difficult.

But the past year-and-a-half has seen unions notch historic wins at several major US companies that had previously seemed impregnable to organizing, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., and hundreds of Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: ). cafes. A serious organizing campaign could pose major headaches for gig company executives.

That’s one reason the companies have worked in recent years to neutralize potential threats by cutting deals with unions and state lawmakers that provide workers with perks without requiring the companies to agree to full-fledged collective bargaining or employment benefits.

Gig workers face a number of hurdles to a successful organizing drive. First they would have to successfully petition for an election at some company. Even if they were deemed employees by the labor board and voted to unionize, management would be legally required to negotiate with them.

But the company could still refuse to do so, forcing the issue into a federal appeals court. A ruling on the issue could blunt the threat to the companies, or exacerbate it much further.

“For now, though, this is a more hawkish pause than we expected, and it strikes us as, well, pointless,"" Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a Wednesday note, suggesting that the Fed isn’t likely to have a clearer view on the economy by the July meeting as incoming data will be sparse.

”Only one round of inflation and labor market data will be released between now and the July meeting, and the unreliability of the monthly numbers means that policy decisions, in our view, should not be determined by such short runs,” it added.

According to an AWS executive, the world's largest cloud computing company is considering AMD's latest AI technology - potentially boosting AMD's inroads into the market currently dominated by rival Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - but is yet to make a final decision.

Either company is yet to make an official comment, although AWS's VP of elastic compute cloud Dave Brown did confirm there are negotiations: ""We're still working together on where exactly that will land between AWS and AMD, but it's something that our teams are working together on.""

AMD recently held an event where the company outlined its AI strategy and unveiled its newest AI products. The company disclosed the specs of its upcoming AI chip, which, 'on paper,' outperforms Nvidia's current best offerings, although it did not name any major clients for the product, leaving investors in the unknown.

Shares of AMD are gaining around 1.7% in pre-market on Wednesday following the announcement, extending an over 94% gain YTD.

Still, the seemingly impressive performance pales when compared to its rival Nvidia - the stock is up 187% YTD, boasting a 35% gain in the past few weeks driven by the AI-related 'monster' revenue guidance hike."

Elsewhere, a California federal court temporarily blocks the completion of a mega merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard, while Nvidia's valuation closes above $1 trillion for the first time.

1. Final countdown to Fed decision

The is set to deliver a fresh monetary policy announcement following the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, with investors keen to find out if the central bank will push pause on its long-running rate-hiking cycle or increase borrowing costs further.

Most estimates point to the former, particularly after data on Tuesday showed that headline inflation growth in the world's largest economy cooled by more than expected in May. At 4.0% on an annual basis, the stood at its lowest level since early 2021 and has now eased for eleven months straight.

But the figure is still well above the Fed's stated 2% target and the labor market is displaying signs of strength, suggesting that while Fed officials may choose to halt rate increases, they may flag that the move is only temporary.

2. Futures mixed with Fed announcement ahead

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Wednesday as investors awaited the latest policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

At 04:51 ET (08:51 GMT), the contract slipped by 35 points or 0.10%, added 9 points or 0.19%, and rose by 41 points or 0.27%.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is a more than 91% chance that the Fed will keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a range of 5.00% to 5.25%. Meanwhile, the probability that the bank chooses to hike borrowing costs by a quarter basis point stands at under 10%.

3. Federal court temporarily blocks Microsoft-Activision merger

A federal court in California has ruled in favor of a request from U.S. antitrust regulators to place a temporary block on the completion of Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) massive $69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ).

The FTC had previously asked the court to order a preliminary injunction on a final tie-up until after the agency has carried out its own administrative review -- due to start later this year -- over the legality of the deal.

A judge in a U.S. district court in California subsequently placed the merger on hold pending a two-day evidentiary hearing next week. At that hearing, a federal court will choose whether the preliminary injunction is warranted.

The FTC has already signaled that it believes the deal, the largest ever in the video games industry, will lessen competition. Microsoft has disagreed, saying it will be a boon for both gamers and companies alike.

Microsoft and Activision must submit their legal arguments against the preliminary injunction by Friday. The FTC will then have until June 20 to respond.

4. Nvidia closes with over $1T valuation

Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) edged up in premarket dealmaking after a milestone session that saw the chipmaking giant's valuation end the trading day at above $1T for the first time.

California-based Nvidia first cracked the vaunted Trillion Dollar Club late last month, when the stock price surpassed the threshold level of $404.87. However, they had yet to close above that mark until yesterday.

The company has been a massive beneficiary of a boom in interest in artificial intelligence, with the graphics cards maker saying that it expects the trend to power robust demand. The optimism has helped spur other firms with links to automated technology.

Nvidia is one of a number of major tech industry players, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Microsoft, to reach a trillion-dollar valuation.

5. Shell outlines plan to boost dividend

Shell (LON: ) has said it will aim to lift its dividend and cut spending as chief executive Wael Sawan looks to restore wavering investor confidence in the business through ""performance, discipline and simplification.""

Europe's largest energy company said it will raise overall shareholder distributions to 30% to 40% of cash flow from operations, up from its prior level of 20% to 30%. As a part of this plan, Shell will bump up its dividend by 15% from the second quarter, while the rate of share buybacks will go up to at least $5B for the second half of 2022.

Meanwhile, capital expenditures will be slashed to $22B to $25B per year for 2024 and 2025, down from a range of $23B to $27B planned for this year.

Shell will present these proposals at an investor conference in New York later today. According to Reuters, Sawan has been keen to support the company's stock price at a time when shareholders have been skeptical of its plans to shift away from oil and gas in favor of its renewables and low-carbon businesses."

2022-06-13, Bloomberg,"Opera Workers’ Ruling Offers Path for Uber, Lyft Drivers to Unionize",https://in.investing.com/news/opera-workers-ruling-offers-path-for-uber-lyft-drivers-to-unionize-3683696,"(Bloomberg) -- A US labor board ruling on Tuesday laid the groundwork for drivers from Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc. and Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: ). and other gig workers to formally unionize – a still difficult but potentially transformative task.

In a ruling concerning workers at the Atlanta Opera (NASDAQ: ), the National Labor Relations Board’s Democratic majority voted to make it easier for workers to prove they’re employees rather than independent contractors, granting them the right to organize.

“Applying this clear standard will ensure that workers who seek to organize or exercise their rights under the National Labor Relations Act are not improperly excluded from its protections,” NLRB Chairman Lauren McFerran said in a statement.

While the decision directly involves hair and makeup workers at the opera, it also changes the precedent for who should be considered an employee at companies throughout the economy. The new ruling is likely to embolden workers at companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash Inc. to pursue cases, arguing they are also employees with union rights.

Gig company executives have argued that the flexibility they offer workers and the prices they offer consumers depend on their ability to keep classifying their workers as non-employees. Even with the opera precedent, the companies can try to persuade the government that their workers still qualify as contractors, as they have tried to do in states that passed laws cracking down on contractor misclassification. And even if gig workers are deemed to be employees, labor organizers might struggle to sign up enough workers to petition for a unionization election and win the ensuing vote.

Labor advocates have long complained that US labor law lets companies deploy aggressive tactics to defeat organizing drives — such as holding mandatory anti-union meetings about how unionizing could harm them — and provides only weak penalties for companies that illegally retaliate. The nature of jobs like ride-hailing, in which drivers largely work alone and with varying schedules and locations, can make organizing particularly difficult.

But the past year-and-a-half has seen unions notch historic wins at several major US companies that had previously seemed impregnable to organizing, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., and hundreds of Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ: ). cafes. A serious organizing campaign could pose major headaches for gig company executives.

That’s one reason the companies have worked in recent years to neutralize potential threats by cutting deals with unions and state lawmakers that provide workers with perks without requiring the companies to agree to full-fledged collective bargaining or employment benefits.

Gig workers face a number of hurdles to a successful organizing drive. First they would have to successfully petition for an election at some company. Even if they were deemed employees by the labor board and voted to unionize, management would be legally required to negotiate with them.

But the company could still refuse to do so, forcing the issue into a federal appeals court. A ruling on the issue could blunt the threat to the companies, or exacerbate it much further.

A lackluster response to Apple's Vision Pro

Wall Street reacted with caution to Apple's (NASDAQ: ) launch of its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, which comes at a higher-than-expected price of $3,499.

CFRA, for example, said

Although we are impressed by its best-in-class hardware/immersive capabilities, we think AAPL failed to identify why it's a must-own device for consumers, at least for now. Still, the company's entry into the space and greater engagement from developers will help support adoption and new use cases over time.

Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.

And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""

Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.

Coinbase sued by SEC

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.

“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.

The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.

Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year.









General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging network

General Motors (NYSE: ) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ: ), into its EVs beginning in 2025.

The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE: ) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.

These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.

The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.

After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""

GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.

Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: report

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.

Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.

Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.

""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" it wrote in a client note.

The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.

Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.

Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdown

Netflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.

Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.

The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.

The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.

Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.

2022-06-11, IANS,"Twitter refuses to pay Google Cloud bill, trust and safety services at risk",https://in.investing.com/news/twitter-refuses-to-pay-google-cloud-bill-trust-and-safety-services-at-risk-3680106,"San Francisco, June 11 (IANS) Elon Musk-run Twitter has reportedly refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract comes up for renewal this month.

According to a report in Platformer, unless Twitter pays up or works something out, ""its access could be cut off on June 30th when their contract ends"".

Prior to Musk acquiring the micro-blogging platform for $44 billion in October last year, the company signed a multi-year contract with Google to host services related to fighting spam, removing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and protecting accounts.

If Twitter fails to pay Google Cloud, its trust and safety teams can be left crippled.

Twitter has been trying to renegotiate its contract with Google since at least March.

""It had also delayed payments to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), leading the company to threaten withholding advertising payments,"" the report noted.

Smyte, a company Twitter acquired in 2018 that offers tools to stop abuse and harassment, is among the services currently running on Google Cloud Platform.

""It is now scheduled to be shut down June 30, sources say. If Smyte goes down, it will likely reduce Twitter's ability to achieve two of Musk's stated priorities: removing CSAM and bots,"" Zoe Schiffer, Managing Editor of Platformer, tweeted on Sunday.

In March, Platformer first reported, citing people aware of the situation, that Twitter sales and marketing staff were told by their colleagues that ""Amazon had threatened to withhold payment for advertising it runs on Twitter because the social network for months refused to pay its Amazon Web Services bills for cloud computing services"".

2022-06-10, IANS,Indian-origin Vishal Garg's Better.com lays off real estate team,https://in.investing.com/news/indianorigin-vishal-gargs-bettercom-lays-off-real-estate-team-3679669,"San Francisco, June 10 (IANS) The embattled online mortgage lender Better.com, run by controversial Indian-origin CEO Vishal Garg, has reportedly laid off its real estate team and has shut down this unit.

The company is said to be shifting from an in-house agent model to a partnership agent model, reports TechCrunch.

The report cited an impacted employee as saying that they received ""little to no severance, after getting a more than 50 per cent salary cut in November in order to 'ensure' our jobs to come"".

It was, however, not clear how many employees were affected in the latest job cuts.

In December 2021, Garg laid off nearly 900 employees over a Zoom call that created a furore.

In total, he laid off more than 4,000 employees in the US and India.

According to the company, the uncertain mortgage market conditions created an exceedingly challenging operating environment for many companies in the industry.

In March this year, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) signed a deal with Better.com to allow employees to use their shares in the company toward a mortgage down payment.

Better.com launched 'Equity Unlocker' that allows Amazon employees to use their vested equity as collateral for a down payment for buying homes.

According to Garg, Amazon employees can finance their homes without actually selling their shares.

""Even though equity is a valuable asset, it is considered ineligible by most banks and financial institutions when calculating the necessary down payment on a home,"" said Garg.

The , which entered a bull market a day earlier after closing up 20% from its October low, was up 0.2%. The gained 0.1%, or 36 points, and the gained 0.3%.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 3% to remain on track for an 18-day win streak as investors cheered news that General Motors is partnering with the electric vehicle maker to access its EV charging network.

The Tesla-GM collaboration will provide GM EV drivers with access to 12,000 Tesla superchargers, Wedbush says, noting that this is a “large monetization opportunity for the company in its supercharger story.”

The opportunity adds to Tesla’s “growing sum-of-the-parts valuation that we now peg at $300 per share with its developing energy business along with its well-established EV machine,” Wedbush said after adding Tesla to its best ideas list.

General Motors Company (NYSE: ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: ), which recently also struck a similar deal to access Tesla’s superchargers, were also higher.

Big tech also added to gains from a day earlier, riding the ongoing wave of bullish sentiment as Wall Street continues to talk up the opportunity of artificial intelligence for tech giants, which have the capital needed to gain a stronghold in the emerging AI industry.

""The larger technology companies can absorb the costs of building these large language models, afford some of these computing costs, as well as comply with regulation,” Goldman Sachs said in a recent blog post.

Adobe (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, continued to rack up gains ahead of its quarterly results due Jun. 15 after Wells Fargo upgraded the stock to Overweight from Buy amid optimism that its AI progress will likely boost growth.

DocuSign (NASDAQ: ) gave up gains, falling more than 3% after its better-than-expected were overshadowed by cautious remarks from CEO Allan C. Thygesen who flagged slowing growth and a cautious customer backdrop.

That brings to end the bear market that began in January 2022.

Buoyed by gains in big technology stocks, the broad-based index closed at 4,293.93 and crossed the threshold that separates a bear market from a bull market -- that's investor-speak for a period of time marked by rising stock prices and optimism on Wall Street, CNN reported.

Markets have remained surprisingly resilient over the past nine months, as 2022 losers like tech and media have bounced back from a disastrous year on hope that the worst is over for those industries.

The AI boom has fueled interest in tech stocks, which dominate the S&P 500.

After a horrible year for Big Tech, optimism has returned as ChatGPT has made AI the it-thing in Silicon Valley.

Investors are placing big bets on Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia and others, hoping they can drive a new tech revolution with artificial intelligence.

Over the past week, markets have gained momentum, likely because of the end of the debt ceiling crisis, optimism that the Federal Reserve will pause rate hikes at its June meeting and a recent string of strong economic readings, CNN reported.

And while those are all positives for the economy, analysts fear that this could be a short-lived rally that ends up biting investors.

Inflation remains too high for comfort. The US economy is still adding jobs but the pace has been mostly slower.

Consumers are still spending, but they're pulling back on discretionary expenses like clothing and, focusing instead on necessities like food and leisure activities. That isn't exactly a recipe for long-term market success, CNN reported.

(NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: ).

Meta Platforms was initiated with an Equal Weight rating and a price target of $276. Wells Fargo expressed skepticism towards optimistic earnings estimates for 2024. The firm believes that near-term growth is likely limited due to substantial investments in AI/Metaverse and potential EU regulatory risks. It also forecasts higher capital expenditures for 2024 and anticipates increased pressure on Meta's free cash flow due to spending on servers and data centers.

Amazon was initiated with an Overweight rating and a $159 price target. Wells Fargo forecasts that North America Retail margins will recover to 2019 levels by 2025, a year earlier than market expectations. It anticipates a positive inflection in AWS growth beginning in August and ending the year with 15% growth. “We are tactically positive on the AWS business given 2H reacceleration potential, but see market share trend vs. Azure obscuring longer-term optimism,” said the firm, adding that it views Amazon as its top pick in the internet sector.

Alphabet was initiated with an Equal Weight rating and a $117 price target. Wells Fargo noted that the conversational search format transition brings significant uncertainty to the search market for the first time in over a decade. It anticipates pricing volatility and aggressive competition over Google’s search distribution partnerships, which could negatively impact medium-term search growth and profitability. “Even if Google maintains search leadership, we do not expect a replication of last decade’s prosperity for the company,” added the firm."

Analysts told investors that generative artificial intelligence (AI) could show up at Amazon Web Services (AWS) by the fourth quarter.

""We see room for AMZN shares to move higher as AWS reaccelerates in 4Q as Bedrock expands,"" analysts wrote. "" Our May 24th AI day, combined with other channel feedback, make us more sanguine on AWS prospects in GenAI.""

""Increasing compute demand, particularly as Bedrock expands later this year, should drive acceleration in 4Q, which we move higher.""

Analysts also believe Amazon will benefit from incumbency status and the potential commoditization of LLMs.

""While AWS is coming from behind on LLMs, our checks suggest that FMs could be commoditized, which would benefit AWS. Channel contacts expect AWS to catch up quickly in its LLMs and AI focused chips, which should see plenty of demand regardless given shortages,"" they added."

According to a Bloomberg report last week, Amazon has been in discussions with a number of mobile carriers -- including Verizon (NYSE: ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), and Dish Network (NASDAQ: ) -- over possibly offering Prime users nationwide wireless plans for $10 a month or lower. The talks have been ongoing for six to eight weeks, with Amazon keen to secure the lowest possible wholesale prices, the Bloomberg report said.

Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as AT&T, denied any negotiations were underway, Reuters said, while Dish did not provide a comment to the news agency.

In a note, the CFRA analysts said that the e-commerce giant is currently focused on boosting its retail margins, particularly as growth at its key cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services shows signs of flagging.

Amazon may subsequently be dissuaded from spending heavily on subsidizing wireless phone plans for Prime members at the current moment, they added.

Meanwhile, the deal could see wireless carriers lose direct access to customers, which may outweigh the amount of indirect consumers they gain from Amazon, the analysts said."

Amazon started with Overweight rating at Wells Fargo , upgraded by Edgewater

Wells Fargo initiated coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) with an Overweight rating and a price target of $159.00. Meanwhile, Edgewater Research upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform, as InvestingPro reported in real time.

Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is planning to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service. This follows similar moves by competitors like Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ), who are also exploring ad-supported options to support content spending. Additionally, Amazon is reportedly in talks with Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ) to add ad-based tiers to their streaming services through Prime Video channels. Amazon, Paramount, and Warner have declined to comment on the matter, the WSJ said.

Aptive upgraded to Outperform

Wolfe Research upgraded Aptiv (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Peerperform with a price target of $130.00.

The firm sees several upcoming catalysts for Aptive, including a strong upward trajectory for margins, and significant potential for upside to consensus estimates. 2022 Street consensus of $4.38 EPS is consistent with the company's $4.00-$4.50 guidance, but Wolfe expects guidance to be raised on Q2/23 earnings call in August.

2 more upgrades

Evercore ISI upgraded Marsh & McLennan (NYSE: ) to Outperform from In Line and raised its price target to $199.00 from $195.00, expecting a 4-5% upside to consensus EPS with more visibility given a greater ability to leverage Centers of Excellence.

Piper Sandler upgraded Glaukos (NYSE: ) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $80.00 from $55.00, noting it believes the Street is underestimating the ramp of both iStent Infinite and, more critically, iDose.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

A lackluster response to Apple's Vision Pro

Wall Street reacted with caution to Apple's (NASDAQ: ) launch of its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, which comes at a higher-than-expected price of $3,499.

CFRA, for example, said

Although we are impressed by its best-in-class hardware/immersive capabilities, we think AAPL failed to identify why it's a must-own device for consumers, at least for now. Still, the company's entry into the space and greater engagement from developers will help support adoption and new use cases over time.

Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.

And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""

Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.

Coinbase sued by SEC

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.

“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.

The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.

Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year.









General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging network

General Motors (NYSE: ) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ: ), into its EVs beginning in 2025.

The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE: ) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.

These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.

The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.

After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""

GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.

Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: report

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.

Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.

The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.

Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.

Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdown

Netflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.

Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.

The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.

The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.

Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.

2022-06-11, IANS,"Twitter refuses to pay Google Cloud bill, trust and safety services at risk",https://in.investing.com/news/twitter-refuses-to-pay-google-cloud-bill-trust-and-safety-services-at-risk-3680106,"San Francisco, June 11 (IANS) Elon Musk-run Twitter has reportedly refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract comes up for renewal this month.

According to a report in Platformer, unless Twitter pays up or works something out, ""its access could be cut off on June 30th when their contract ends"".

Prior to Musk acquiring the micro-blogging platform for $44 billion in October last year, the company signed a multi-year contract with Google to host services related to fighting spam, removing child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and protecting accounts.

If Twitter fails to pay Google Cloud, its trust and safety teams can be left crippled.

Twitter has been trying to renegotiate its contract with Google since at least March.

""It had also delayed payments to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), leading the company to threaten withholding advertising payments,"" the report noted.

Smyte, a company Twitter acquired in 2018 that offers tools to stop abuse and harassment, is among the services currently running on Google Cloud Platform.

""It is now scheduled to be shut down June 30, sources say. If Smyte goes down, it will likely reduce Twitter's ability to achieve two of Musk's stated priorities: removing CSAM and bots,"" Zoe Schiffer, Managing Editor of Platformer, tweeted on Sunday.

In March, Platformer first reported, citing people aware of the situation, that Twitter sales and marketing staff were told by their colleagues that ""Amazon had threatened to withhold payment for advertising it runs on Twitter because the social network for months refused to pay its Amazon Web Services bills for cloud computing services"".

2022-06-10, IANS,Indian-origin Vishal Garg's Better.com lays off real estate team,https://in.investing.com/news/indianorigin-vishal-gargs-bettercom-lays-off-real-estate-team-3679669,"San Francisco, June 10 (IANS) The embattled online mortgage lender Better.com, run by controversial Indian-origin CEO Vishal Garg, has reportedly laid off its real estate team and has shut down this unit.

The company is said to be shifting from an in-house agent model to a partnership agent model, reports TechCrunch.

The report cited an impacted employee as saying that they received ""little to no severance, after getting a more than 50 per cent salary cut in November in order to 'ensure' our jobs to come"".

It was, however, not clear how many employees were affected in the latest job cuts.

In December 2021, Garg laid off nearly 900 employees over a Zoom call that created a furore.

In total, he laid off more than 4,000 employees in the US and India.

According to the company, the uncertain mortgage market conditions created an exceedingly challenging operating environment for many companies in the industry.

In March this year, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) signed a deal with Better.com to allow employees to use their shares in the company toward a mortgage down payment.

Better.com launched 'Equity Unlocker' that allows Amazon employees to use their vested equity as collateral for a down payment for buying homes.

According to Garg, Amazon employees can finance their homes without actually selling their shares.

""Even though equity is a valuable asset, it is considered ineligible by most banks and financial institutions when calculating the necessary down payment on a home,"" said Garg.

Taking to Twitter late Friday night, Petro said: ""A joy for the whole country! The 4 children who were lost 40 days ago in the Colombian jungle appeared alive.""

He also attached an image of several members of the military and Indigenous community tending to the siblings -- Lesly Jacobombaire Mucutuy (13), Soleiny Jacobombaire Mucutuy (9), Tien Ranoque Mucutuy (4) and Cristin Ranoque Mucutuy (1).

In a separate statement, the President called it a ""magical day"", adding: ""They were alone, they themselves achieved an example of total survival which will remain in history.

""These children are today the children of peace and the children of Colombia.""

Petro added that he hoped to speak with the children on Saturday.

On May 1, the Cessna 206 light aircraft was flying between Araracuara in Amazonas province and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare, when it disappeared.

Since the crash, more than 100 soldiers with sniffer dogs have been deployed in the search and rescue operations.

Last month, the wreckage of the aircraft and bodies of the the pilot and two adults were found.

One of the dead adults, Ranoque Mucutuy, was the mother of the four children.

The family are from the Huitoto people, an indigenous group in south-eastern Colombia and northern Peru.

2022-06-09, Investing.com,"S&P 500 gives up some gains, but tech strength keeps bulls in control",https://in.investing.com/news/sp-500-gives-up-some-gains-but-tech-strength-keeps-bulls-in-control-3679473,"Investing.com -- The S&P 500 gave up gains Friday, after entering a new bull market a day earlier, but remains supported by an ongoing climb in big tech and a Tesla-led jump in consumer stocks.

The , which entered a bull market a day earlier after closing up 20% from its October low, was up 0.2%. The gained 0.1%, or 36 points, and the gained 0.3%.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) jumped more than 3% to remain on track for an 18-day win streak as investors cheered news that General Motors is partnering with the electric vehicle maker to access its EV charging network.

The Tesla-GM collaboration will provide GM EV drivers with access to 12,000 Tesla superchargers, Wedbush says, noting that this is a “large monetization opportunity for the company in its supercharger story.”

The opportunity adds to Tesla’s “growing sum-of-the-parts valuation that we now peg at $300 per share with its developing energy business along with its well-established EV machine,” Wedbush said after adding Tesla to its best ideas list.

General Motors Company (NYSE: ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: ), which recently also struck a similar deal to access Tesla’s superchargers, were also higher.

Big tech also added to gains from a day earlier, riding the ongoing wave of bullish sentiment as Wall Street continues to talk up the opportunity of artificial intelligence for tech giants, which have the capital needed to gain a stronghold in the emerging AI industry.

""The larger technology companies can absorb the costs of building these large language models, afford some of these computing costs, as well as comply with regulation,” Goldman Sachs said in a recent blog post.

Adobe (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, continued to rack up gains ahead of its quarterly results due Jun. 15 after Wells Fargo upgraded the stock to Overweight from Buy amid optimism that its AI progress will likely boost growth.

DocuSign (NASDAQ: ) gave up gains, falling more than 3% after its better-than-expected were overshadowed by cautious remarks from CEO Allan C. Thygesen who flagged slowing growth and a cautious customer backdrop.

Braze (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, rallied 16% after reporting that were better than feared, prompting positive commentary from Goldman Sachs, which reiterated its Buy rating on the stock, citing potential AI-driven market share gains."

That brings to end the bear market that began in January 2022.

Buoyed by gains in big technology stocks, the broad-based index closed at 4,293.93 and crossed the threshold that separates a bear market from a bull market -- that's investor-speak for a period of time marked by rising stock prices and optimism on Wall Street, CNN reported.

Markets have remained surprisingly resilient over the past nine months, as 2022 losers like tech and media have bounced back from a disastrous year on hope that the worst is over for those industries.

The AI boom has fueled interest in tech stocks, which dominate the S&P 500.

After a horrible year for Big Tech, optimism has returned as ChatGPT has made AI the it-thing in Silicon Valley.

Investors are placing big bets on Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia and others, hoping they can drive a new tech revolution with artificial intelligence.

Over the past week, markets have gained momentum, likely because of the end of the debt ceiling crisis, optimism that the Federal Reserve will pause rate hikes at its June meeting and a recent string of strong economic readings, CNN reported.

And while those are all positives for the economy, analysts fear that this could be a short-lived rally that ends up biting investors.

Inflation remains too high for comfort. The US economy is still adding jobs but the pace has been mostly slower.

Consumers are still spending, but they're pulling back on discretionary expenses like clothing and, focusing instead on necessities like food and leisure activities. That isn't exactly a recipe for long-term market success, CNN reported.

2022-06-08, Investing.com,"Wells Fargo launches coverage on large cap internet stocks: Meta, Google & Amazon",https://in.investing.com/news/wells-fargo-launches-coverage-on-large-cap-internet-stocks-meta-google--amazon-432SI-3677968,"Wells Fargo initiated coverage on 13 large-cap Internet sector companies, including Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: ).

Meta Platforms was initiated with an Equal Weight rating and a price target of $276. Wells Fargo expressed skepticism towards optimistic earnings estimates for 2024. The firm believes that near-term growth is likely limited due to substantial investments in AI/Metaverse and potential EU regulatory risks. It also forecasts higher capital expenditures for 2024 and anticipates increased pressure on Meta's free cash flow due to spending on servers and data centers.

Amazon was initiated with an Overweight rating and a $159 price target. Wells Fargo forecasts that North America Retail margins will recover to 2019 levels by 2025, a year earlier than market expectations. It anticipates a positive inflection in AWS growth beginning in August and ending the year with 15% growth. “We are tactically positive on the AWS business given 2H reacceleration potential, but see market share trend vs. Azure obscuring longer-term optimism,” said the firm, adding that it views Amazon as its top pick in the internet sector.

Alphabet was initiated with an Equal Weight rating and a $117 price target. Wells Fargo noted that the conversational search format transition brings significant uncertainty to the search market for the first time in over a decade. It anticipates pricing volatility and aggressive competition over Google’s search distribution partnerships, which could negatively impact medium-term search growth and profitability. “Even if Google maintains search leadership, we do not expect a replication of last decade’s prosperity for the company,” added the firm."

Analysts told investors that generative artificial intelligence (AI) could show up at Amazon Web Services (AWS) by the fourth quarter.

""We see room for AMZN shares to move higher as AWS reaccelerates in 4Q as Bedrock expands,"" analysts wrote. "" Our May 24th AI day, combined with other channel feedback, make us more sanguine on AWS prospects in GenAI.""

""Increasing compute demand, particularly as Bedrock expands later this year, should drive acceleration in 4Q, which we move higher.""

Analysts also believe Amazon will benefit from incumbency status and the potential commoditization of LLMs.

""While AWS is coming from behind on LLMs, our checks suggest that FMs could be commoditized, which would benefit AWS. Channel contacts expect AWS to catch up quickly in its LLMs and AI focused chips, which should see plenty of demand regardless given shortages,"" they added."

Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.

Warner Discovery and Paramount closed 8.4% and 3.9% higher, respectively, following the news. Amazon stock fell 4.25%.

Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.

""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" they wrote in a client note.

The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into Video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.

2022-06-08, Investing.com,Amazon unlikely to launch wireless service for Prime users soon - CFRA Research,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-unlikely-to-launch-wireless-service-for-prime-users-soon--cfra-research-3677146,"Investing.com -- Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is unlikely to pursue a potential deal to offer steeply discounted, or even free, mobile services to its Prime members in the near term, analysts at CFRA Research have argued.

According to a Bloomberg report last week, Amazon has been in discussions with a number of mobile carriers -- including Verizon (NYSE: ), T-Mobile (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), and Dish Network (NASDAQ: ) -- over possibly offering Prime users nationwide wireless plans for $10 a month or lower. The talks have been ongoing for six to eight weeks, with Amazon keen to secure the lowest possible wholesale prices, the Bloomberg report said.

Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as AT&T, denied any negotiations were underway, Reuters said, while Dish did not provide a comment to the news agency.

In a note, the CFRA analysts said that the e-commerce giant is currently focused on boosting its retail margins, particularly as growth at its key cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services shows signs of flagging.

Amazon may subsequently be dissuaded from spending heavily on subsidizing wireless phone plans for Prime members at the current moment, they added.

Meanwhile, the deal could see wireless carriers lose direct access to customers, which may outweigh the amount of indirect consumers they gain from Amazon, the analysts said."

Amazon started with Overweight rating at Wells Fargo , upgraded by Edgewater

Wells Fargo initiated coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) with an Overweight rating and a price target of $159.00. Meanwhile, Edgewater Research upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform, as InvestingPro reported in real time.

Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is planning to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service. This follows similar moves by competitors like Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ), who are also exploring ad-supported options to support content spending. Additionally, Amazon is reportedly in talks with Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ) to add ad-based tiers to their streaming services through Prime Video channels. Amazon, Paramount, and Warner have declined to comment on the matter, the WSJ said.

Aptive upgraded to Outperform

Wolfe Research upgraded Aptiv (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Peerperform with a price target of $130.00.

The firm sees several upcoming catalysts for Aptive, including a strong upward trajectory for margins, and significant potential for upside to consensus estimates. 2022 Street consensus of $4.38 EPS is consistent with the company's $4.00-$4.50 guidance, but Wolfe expects guidance to be raised on Q2/23 earnings call in August.

2 more upgrades

Evercore ISI upgraded Marsh & McLennan (NYSE: ) to Outperform from In Line and raised its price target to $199.00 from $195.00, expecting a 4-5% upside to consensus EPS with more visibility given a greater ability to leverage Centers of Excellence.

Piper Sandler upgraded Glaukos (NYSE: ) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $80.00 from $55.00, noting it believes the Street is underestimating the ramp of both iStent Infinite and, more critically, iDose.

The Colorado-based big data group said battery-maker Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA) will use the technology to help integrate edge sensors and introduce ""automated efficiencies"" at its factory in Nevada. Starting in 2025, PENA will also bring the system to a new facility in Kansas.

""The agreement expands Palantir's signature platform including artificial intelligence and edge capabilities in the manufacturing space,"" the company noted.

The news comes after Palantir secured a contract with U.S. Special Operations Command earlier this week, enhancing its already deep ties with American government agencies.

“With Affirm on Amazon Pay, merchants can offer a pay-over-time option to their existing customers and have another way to reach new customers.”

Some merchants, including Casper, USA Berkey Filters, and UltraSabers, already use Affirm’s Adaptive Checkout solution within the Amazon Pay app, the press release adds. Accordingly, merchants using Affirm have reported 60% higher average order values when compared to other payment methods.

AWS revenue growth trough “seems near” the analysts said in a client note.

“Google (NASDAQ: ) searches & Reddit data show strong interest for AWS AI offerings,” they wrote.

Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: ) historic print also bodes well for Amazon as AWS and NVDA Data Center revenues correlate ~98% back to 2017.

“The NVDA print arguably represents a historic demand shift toward AI compute with a seemingly long runway for growth,” the analysts added.

On the other hand, they also highlighted that Snowflake's (NYSE: ) recent report shows optimizations continue.

“Optimizations continue across cloud providers and SNOW is closely aligned with AWS. Customer vertical exposure may be at play. Also, GPU pricing data for AWS looks relatively uncompelling in a competitive market,” the analysts added.

Overall, Piper Sandler remains bullish on Amazon on the improving outlook for AWS.

“While optimizations may persist near-term, 3Q represents a year since the 'optimization' cycle began. Backlog growth held steady in 1Q. We have modestly raised our 2024E AWS revenue estimates & make modest tweaks to margins. Street Retail estimates look conservative to us and imply FY24 operating margins well below pre-COVID. We like the setup & see improving trends at AWS & Retail,” the analysts concluded.

Amazon shares are down 0.4% in premarket Wednesday."

The production will begin in the second half of 2022, according to the report.

Speaking on the latest earnings call in late May, the company’s CEO and President discussed a “lot of great progress on share gains, content gains as things like multi-gig ramped up, we added things like new custom ASICs.”

“So, that business has sort of outperformed,” he said.

Marvell said it hopes to “at least” double AI sales this year.

Commenting on the report, Mizuho analysts believe that “any AMZN design that is slated to start or ramp in 2H23 was already in that revenue guide.”

“Some had speculated MSFT would be a leading MRVL ASIC customer. AMZN would make sense as they have some of the biggest custom in-house silicon development (Gravitron). And NVDA CEO has oddly NEVER INCLUDED AMZN as a direct GPU / AI partner in recent presentations, only MSFT, ORCL, GOOG,” they added."

The move comes as US-based Victoria's Secret and other retailers have been forced to bring down prices to help clear out excess inventory.

Speaking during an earnings call last week, chief executive Martin Waters also flagged that the business environment has become ""more challenging"" as inflationary pressures lead consumers to cut back on nonessential spending. Victoria's Secret subsequently slashed its annual sales outlook.

The news comes just a week after another report that Amazon and DISH were in discussions to sell DISH wireless plans through Amazon (i.e., effectively a distribution partnership to help DISH improve sales into its struggling wireless business).

According to Wells Fargo, if Amazon enters the wireless market by selling its own branded plans, it could have a significant impact due to the strength of its brand and vast distribution network (+200 million Amazon Prime subscribers globally, and ~150M in the U.S.).

T-Mobile and Verizon Communications already came out this morning and stated they were not in talks to add Amazon as a partner. Wells Fargo believes this would leave DISH as the most likely partner, although DISH leverages a wholesale agreement with AT&T (NYSE: ) and T-Mobile in areas where it does not have coverage.

Following the news, DISH stock jumped more than 16% on Friday, while telecom stocks had a terrible day, with Verizon down 3%, and T-Mobile down 5%.

The article also mentioned that Amazon is negotiating for the lowest possible wholesale prices from a network partner.

According to BofA Securities, in a worst-case scenario, Amazon could introduce its own wireless product by leveraging a premier network wholesale deal and bundling it with Amazon Prime at a significant discount compared to existing mobile alternatives.

According to the bank, the situation resembles the prisoner's dilemma, where each carrier fears that another carrier might strike a deal that could harm the industry. While carriers come out denying Amazon talks, and so did Amazon, analysts at HSBC mentioned that nervousness around the pricing environment and customer growth prospects are evident."

2022-06-05, Investing.com,WWE announces multi-year partnership with live streaming platform Twitch,https://in.investing.com/news/wwe-announces-multiyear-partnership-with-live-streaming-platform-twitch-3672517,"Investing.com -- World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE: ) has announced a multi-year partnership with streaming platform Twitch.

The agreement will see the WWE channel and WWE Superstar channels return to Twitch, WWE said in a statement on Monday, adding that the deal will feature live and exclusive content.

A key part of this offering will be a companion sidecast to WWE's Monday Night RAW program that will be led by a ""rotating cast of hosts"" that will bring ""the WWE Universe behind the scenes and closer to the in-ring action,"" the company noted.

WWE combines the worlds of sports and entertainment through a mixture of fighting, plot, and often colorful characters. In April, the business agreed to a $21 billion all-stock merger with Endeavor Group's Ultimate Fighting Championship. The tie-up is expected to close in the second half of 2022.

Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), is an interactive platform that is best known for video game live streaming. It has just over 2.4 million viewers on a seven-day average, with many of those watching between the ages of 18 and 34, according to company data and publicity material.

Attracting younger viewers and adapting to their media consumption habits have become key challenges for the more than $80B North American sports market, a report from business intelligence firm Morning Consult found last December.

Nearly a third of sports fans from so-called Generation Z -- the cohort born between 1996 and 2010 -- say they watch live sports via authorized streaming platforms, the study said, while only 28% tune in through traditional broadcast or cable television."
2022-06-04, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3671132,"Investing.com -- The economic calendar is light in the coming week but rate decisions in Canada and Australia will be in the spotlight in the run-up to the Federal Reserve’s keenly anticipated announcement on June 14. Investors remain cautious despite a rally in tech stocks and market watchers will get an update on the outlook for the global economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. data

With the Fed entering its traditional blackout period ahead of its June 13- 14 meeting there will be no officials discussing the monetary policy outlook.

Friday’s mixed U.S. employment report showed job growth accelerating in May but also indicated that wage gains are moderating. An increase in the unemployment rate added to the view that conditions in the labor market are easing.

The jobs data underlined expectations for the Fed to pause hiking rates at its upcoming meeting. It would be the first halt since the Fed started its aggressive anti-inflation policy tightening more than a year ago.

The is out on Monday and is expected to point to a still solid rate of expansion, in contrast with the which contracted for a seventh straight month in May.

Other reports include Wednesday’s and Thursday’s numbers.

Stock market gains

Some investors are becoming increasingly wary about how much market gains have come to be dominated by the out-performance of a small handful of megacap stocks while the rest of the market treads water.

The tech-heavy has gained 33% so far in 2022 and the benchmark has risen 11.5% year to date, currently standing at a 10-month high.

The combined weight of five stocks - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - now accounts for 25% of the S&P 500’s market value, with the buzz around advances in artificial intelligence fuelling hopes for significant future gains.

A rally concentrated in a handful of stocks raises questions about the health of the broader market and risks igniting volatility if investors ditch those megacap holdings.

Central bank decisions

Ahead of the Fed’s upcoming meeting the and the Bank of Canada will both hold policy meetings this week, as officials in both countries grapple with still persistent inflation.

Tuesday’s RBA decision could go either way after April inflation data rose much more strongly than expected.

Rates are already at an 11-year peak after a surprise hike last month, with RBA governor Philip Lowe saying he wanted to send a clear message that the central bank will do whatever it takes to win the inflation fight.

Meanwhile, markets expect the to deliver a hawkish hold - indicating that they could raise rates again in July unless there is evidence of cooling inflation.

Eurozone

In the Eurozone, data on Monday will show how the German economy performed at the start of the second quarter, with data on , and due out after data last week showing that the bloc’s largest economy slid into recession in the first quarter.

The European Central Bank is to publish the results of its consumer expectation survey on Tuesday which will show whether inflation expectations are becoming more entrenched.

ECB President Christine Lagarde is to testify before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on Monday and her comments will be closely watched.

Other ECB officials due to make appearances before the central bank enters its quiet period on Thursday ahead of its June 15 meeting include board members Luis de Guindos and Fabio Panetta.

World Bank and OECD global economic forecasts

Investors will get an update on the outlook for the global economy when the World Bank releases its latest projections for global growth on Tuesday, followed a day later by OECD with its own forecasts.

Last month the World Bank warned of a slow-growth crisis in the global economy that could persist over the coming decade amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation, the ongoing effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and three years of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, OECD raised its forecasts for global growth back in March saying it expects global growth to reach 2.6% this year and 2.9% in 2024 but warned that the outlook remains fragile, and risks remained tilted to the downside.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Soft guidance at Salesforce

Salesforce (NYSE: ) shares slumped 4.7% on Thursday even after the company reported .

Analysts say the stock sold off because Salesforce revenue outperformance was below historical trends, and it also missed on under-contract sales expected in the next 12 months (that is, cRPO, or current revenue performance obligation). Moreover, its revenue growth for the quarter came in at its slowest pace since 2010, per Reuters.

For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.69, $0.08 better than the average analyst estimate, and $8.25 billion in sales was ahead of the $8.18B consensus. Next quarter Salesforce expects sales of $8.51B to $8.53B, higher than the $8.49B estimates.

Despite the market's reaction, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on CRM shares, saying the results were ""strong in light of the challenging macro backdrop.""

Bank of America reaffirmed a Top Pick status on CRM, noting it is ""impressed"" by the 1% guidance beat for cRPO growth ""given the tough macro and disruption from restructuring actions.""

Shares closed the week at $213.03.

Broadcom's better-than-expected print

On Thursday, Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) said it recorded of $10.32 per share, easily beating the $10.12 consensus, on slightly better-than-expected revenue of $8.73B. It expects $8.85B in sales for the third quarter, comfortably above estimates for $8.72B.

Goldman Sachs said the company delivered ""another solid quarter,"" citing its expectations for that generative artificial intelligence ""has the potential to support a 'soft-landing' in the near term and drive above-model growth in the medium- to long-term.""

Similarly, BofA argues that Broadcom's AI portfolio is ""underappreciated,"" and assigned the stock a new Street-high price target of $950.

Shares dipped in the premarket on Friday, but ultimately closed the regular session up 2.5%. Shares ended the week at $812 even.



HP sees weakness in PC demand

HP (NYSE: ) shares slid some 6% Wednesday after the PC maker for a quarter since early 2020, noting ongoing weakness in demand for personal computers.

For the fiscal second quarter ended in April, HP reported a 21.7% drop in overall revenue to $12.9B - below expectations for $13.1B - encompassing a 29% slide in PC business sales and a 5% dip in printing revenue.

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 beat expectations for $0.76. Third-quarter (ending July) guidance calls for adjusted earnings of $0.81 to $0.91 a share vs. the $0.85 consensus, and it expects $3.30 to $3.50 for the full year, up from a prior analysts' estimate of $3.34.

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the company, saying it remains cautious on HPQ shares even though guidance implies a second-half sales recovery: ""We expect margins to normalize lower, and estimates to be revised lower over the next couple of qtrs.""

Barclays said the guidance may prove to be ""aggressive,"" adding, ""We continue to see downside for shares with near term top-line, margin and cash flow pressures, though cost cuts help offset some of the underlying weaknesses.""

HP shares staged a partial recovery to end the week, rising 3.8% to $30.55.

Dell throttles estimates amid challenging macro environment

On Thursday Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) said totaled $1.31, smashing the $0.86 average Street estimate, on better-than-expected revenue of $20.9B.

The beat on the bottom line comes even as margins and revenue fell amid a weaker backdrop for PC demand, and Dell guided for Q2 revenue of $20.7B at the midpoint of the range - worse than the Street at $21.1B.

Dell's client solutions group and infrastructure solutions group business saw revenue fall 23% and 18% respectively amid ""challenging economic backdrop,"" the company said.

The stock saw a premarket slump before climbing 4% in Friday's regular session.

Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each kept their buy ratings on the stock, although the former highlighted a weak recovery in Dell's core PC business.

Deutsche said it believes ""the risk-reward is attractive"" for the stock, noting, ""Considering a tough macro environment suggested by other IT hardware peers, we are not too surprised by DELL's cautious comments in the near term, and we view a delayed recovery as reasonable.""

Amazon denies report it is setting its sights on telecom space

An Amazon (NASDAQ: ) spokesperson said the company doesn't have plans to add wireless services at this time, Reuters reported, following a Bloomberg story that said Amazon is in talks to offer low-cost or free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers - news that shook the shares of telecom companies.

""We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don't have plans to add wireless at this time,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters, while AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile ""denied any talks.""

Amazon stock had gotten a lift on the initial report, while telecom companies like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: ), AT&T Inc (NYSE: ), and Verizon (NYSE: ) took sharp slides.

On the other hand, shares in DISH Network (NASDAQ: ) gained as much as 8.3% on the report. The satellite services provider is already working with Amazon and is expected to start selling its wireless services on Amazon in July.

Two companies said that eligible U.S. merchants offering Amazon Pay can now seamlessly add Affirm’s Adaptive Checkout as a payment option at checkout.

“We know customers want convenient and flexible payment options—whether they’re checking out on Amazon.com or using Amazon Pay,” said Omar Soudodi, director of Amazon Pay.

“With Affirm on Amazon Pay, merchants can offer a pay-over-time option to their existing customers and have another way to reach new customers.”

Some merchants, including Casper, USA Berkey Filters, and UltraSabers, already use Affirm’s Adaptive Checkout solution within the Amazon Pay app, the press release adds. Accordingly, merchants using Affirm have reported 60% higher average order values when compared to other payment methods.

AWS revenue growth trough “seems near” the analysts said in a client note.

“Google (NASDAQ: ) searches & Reddit data show strong interest for AWS AI offerings,” they wrote.

Nvidia’s (NASDAQ: ) historic print also bodes well for Amazon as AWS and NVDA Data Center revenues correlate ~98% back to 2017.

“The NVDA print arguably represents a historic demand shift toward AI compute with a seemingly long runway for growth,” the analysts added.

On the other hand, they also highlighted that Snowflake's (NYSE: ) recent report shows optimizations continue.

“Optimizations continue across cloud providers and SNOW is closely aligned with AWS. Customer vertical exposure may be at play. Also, GPU pricing data for AWS looks relatively uncompelling in a competitive market,” the analysts added.

Overall, Piper Sandler remains bullish on Amazon on the improving outlook for AWS.

“While optimizations may persist near-term, 3Q represents a year since the 'optimization' cycle began. Backlog growth held steady in 1Q. We have modestly raised our 2024E AWS revenue estimates & make modest tweaks to margins. Street Retail estimates look conservative to us and imply FY24 operating margins well below pre-COVID. We like the setup & see improving trends at AWS & Retail,” the analysts concluded.

Amazon shares are down 0.4% in premarket Wednesday."

The production will begin in the second half of 2022, according to the report.

Speaking on the latest earnings call in late May, the company’s CEO and President discussed a “lot of great progress on share gains, content gains as things like multi-gig ramped up, we added things like new custom ASICs.”

“So, that business has sort of outperformed,” he said.

Marvell said it hopes to “at least” double AI sales this year.

Commenting on the report, Mizuho analysts believe that “any AMZN design that is slated to start or ramp in 2H23 was already in that revenue guide.”

“Some had speculated MSFT would be a leading MRVL ASIC customer. AMZN would make sense as they have some of the biggest custom in-house silicon development (Gravitron). And NVDA CEO has oddly NEVER INCLUDED AMZN as a direct GPU / AI partner in recent presentations, only MSFT, ORCL, GOOG,” they added."

2022-06-05, Investing.com,WWE announces multi-year partnership with live streaming platform Twitch,https://in.investing.com/news/wwe-announces-multiyear-partnership-with-live-streaming-platform-twitch-3672517,"Investing.com -- World Wrestling Entertainment (NYSE: ) has announced a multi-year partnership with streaming platform Twitch.

The agreement will see the WWE channel and WWE Superstar channels return to Twitch, WWE said in a statement on Monday, adding that the deal will feature live and exclusive content.

A key part of this offering will be a companion sidecast to WWE's Monday Night RAW program that will be led by a ""rotating cast of hosts"" that will bring ""the WWE Universe behind the scenes and closer to the in-ring action,"" the company noted.

WWE combines the worlds of sports and entertainment through a mixture of fighting, plot, and often colorful characters. In April, the business agreed to a $21 billion all-stock merger with Endeavor Group's Ultimate Fighting Championship. The tie-up is expected to close in the second half of 2022.

Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), is an interactive platform that is best known for video game live streaming. It has just over 2.4 million viewers on a seven-day average, with many of those watching between the ages of 18 and 34, according to company data and publicity material.

Attracting younger viewers and adapting to their media consumption habits have become key challenges for the more than $80B North American sports market, a report from business intelligence firm Morning Consult found last December.

Nearly a third of sports fans from so-called Generation Z -- the cohort born between 1996 and 2010 -- say they watch live sports via authorized streaming platforms, the study said, while only 28% tune in through traditional broadcast or cable television."
2022-06-04, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3671132,"Investing.com -- The economic calendar is light in the coming week but rate decisions in Canada and Australia will be in the spotlight in the run-up to the Federal Reserve’s keenly anticipated announcement on June 14. Investors remain cautious despite a rally in tech stocks and market watchers will get an update on the outlook for the global economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. data

With the Fed entering its traditional blackout period ahead of its June 13- 14 meeting there will be no officials discussing the monetary policy outlook.

Friday’s mixed U.S. employment report showed job growth accelerating in May but also indicated that wage gains are moderating. An increase in the unemployment rate added to the view that conditions in the labor market are easing.

The jobs data underlined expectations for the Fed to pause hiking rates at its upcoming meeting. It would be the first halt since the Fed started its aggressive anti-inflation policy tightening more than a year ago.

The is out on Monday and is expected to point to a still solid rate of expansion, in contrast with the which contracted for a seventh straight month in May.

Other reports include Wednesday’s and Thursday’s numbers.

Stock market gains

Some investors are becoming increasingly wary about how much market gains have come to be dominated by the out-performance of a small handful of megacap stocks while the rest of the market treads water.

The tech-heavy has gained 33% so far in 2022 and the benchmark has risen 11.5% year to date, currently standing at a 10-month high.

The combined weight of five stocks - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - now accounts for 25% of the S&P 500’s market value, with the buzz around advances in artificial intelligence fuelling hopes for significant future gains.

A rally concentrated in a handful of stocks raises questions about the health of the broader market and risks igniting volatility if investors ditch those megacap holdings.

Central bank decisions

Ahead of the Fed’s upcoming meeting the and the Bank of Canada will both hold policy meetings this week, as officials in both countries grapple with still persistent inflation.

Tuesday’s RBA decision could go either way after April inflation data rose much more strongly than expected.

Rates are already at an 11-year peak after a surprise hike last month, with RBA governor Philip Lowe saying he wanted to send a clear message that the central bank will do whatever it takes to win the inflation fight.

Meanwhile, markets expect the to deliver a hawkish hold - indicating that they could raise rates again in July unless there is evidence of cooling inflation.

Eurozone

In the Eurozone, data on Monday will show how the German economy performed at the start of the second quarter, with data on , and due out after data last week showing that the bloc’s largest economy slid into recession in the first quarter.

The European Central Bank is to publish the results of its consumer expectation survey on Tuesday which will show whether inflation expectations are becoming more entrenched.

ECB President Christine Lagarde is to testify before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament on Monday and her comments will be closely watched.

Other ECB officials due to make appearances before the central bank enters its quiet period on Thursday ahead of its June 15 meeting include board members Luis de Guindos and Fabio Panetta.

World Bank and OECD global economic forecasts

Investors will get an update on the outlook for the global economy when the World Bank releases its latest projections for global growth on Tuesday, followed a day later by OECD with its own forecasts.

Last month the World Bank warned of a slow-growth crisis in the global economy that could persist over the coming decade amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation, the ongoing effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and three years of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, OECD raised its forecasts for global growth back in March saying it expects global growth to reach 2.6% this year and 2.9% in 2024 but warned that the outlook remains fragile, and risks remained tilted to the downside.

Soft guidance at Salesforce

Salesforce (NYSE: ) shares slumped 4.7% on Thursday even after the company reported .

Analysts say the stock sold off because Salesforce revenue outperformance was below historical trends, and it also missed on under-contract sales expected in the next 12 months (that is, cRPO, or current revenue performance obligation). Moreover, its revenue growth for the quarter came in at its slowest pace since 2010, per Reuters.

For the quarter, adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.69, $0.08 better than the average analyst estimate, and $8.25 billion in sales was ahead of the $8.18B consensus. Next quarter Salesforce expects sales of $8.51B to $8.53B, higher than the $8.49B estimates.

Despite the market's reaction, Goldman Sachs reiterated its Buy rating on CRM shares, saying the results were ""strong in light of the challenging macro backdrop.""

Bank of America reaffirmed a Top Pick status on CRM, noting it is ""impressed"" by the 1% guidance beat for cRPO growth ""given the tough macro and disruption from restructuring actions.""

Shares closed the week at $213.03.

Broadcom's better-than-expected print

On Thursday, Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) said it recorded of $10.32 per share, easily beating the $10.12 consensus, on slightly better-than-expected revenue of $8.73B. It expects $8.85B in sales for the third quarter, comfortably above estimates for $8.72B.

Goldman Sachs said the company delivered ""another solid quarter,"" citing its expectations for that generative artificial intelligence ""has the potential to support a 'soft-landing' in the near term and drive above-model growth in the medium- to long-term.""

Similarly, BofA argues that Broadcom's AI portfolio is ""underappreciated,"" and assigned the stock a new Street-high price target of $950.

Shares dipped in the premarket on Friday, but ultimately closed the regular session up 2.5%. Shares ended the week at $812 even.



HP sees weakness in PC demand

HP (NYSE: ) shares slid some 6% Wednesday after the PC maker for a quarter since early 2020, noting ongoing weakness in demand for personal computers.

For the fiscal second quarter ended in April, HP reported a 21.7% drop in overall revenue to $12.9B - below expectations for $13.1B - encompassing a 29% slide in PC business sales and a 5% dip in printing revenue.

Adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 beat expectations for $0.76. Third-quarter (ending July) guidance calls for adjusted earnings of $0.81 to $0.91 a share vs. the $0.85 consensus, and it expects $3.30 to $3.50 for the full year, up from a prior analysts' estimate of $3.34.

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the company, saying it remains cautious on HPQ shares even though guidance implies a second-half sales recovery: ""We expect margins to normalize lower, and estimates to be revised lower over the next couple of qtrs.""

Barclays said the guidance may prove to be ""aggressive,"" adding, ""We continue to see downside for shares with near term top-line, margin and cash flow pressures, though cost cuts help offset some of the underlying weaknesses.""

HP shares staged a partial recovery to end the week, rising 3.8% to $30.55.

Dell throttles estimates amid challenging macro environment

On Thursday Dell Technologies (NYSE: ) said totaled $1.31, smashing the $0.86 average Street estimate, on better-than-expected revenue of $20.9B.

The beat on the bottom line comes even as margins and revenue fell amid a weaker backdrop for PC demand, and Dell guided for Q2 revenue of $20.7B at the midpoint of the range - worse than the Street at $21.1B.

Dell's client solutions group and infrastructure solutions group business saw revenue fall 23% and 18% respectively amid ""challenging economic backdrop,"" the company said.

The stock saw a premarket slump before climbing 4% in Friday's regular session.

Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each kept their buy ratings on the stock, although the former highlighted a weak recovery in Dell's core PC business.

Deutsche said it believes ""the risk-reward is attractive"" for the stock, noting, ""Considering a tough macro environment suggested by other IT hardware peers, we are not too surprised by DELL's cautious comments in the near term, and we view a delayed recovery as reasonable.""

Amazon denies report it is setting its sights on telecom space

An Amazon (NASDAQ: ) spokesperson said the company doesn't have plans to add wireless services at this time, Reuters reported, following a Bloomberg story that said Amazon is in talks to offer low-cost or free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers - news that shook the shares of telecom companies.

""We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don't have plans to add wireless at this time,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters, while AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile ""denied any talks.""

Amazon stock had gotten a lift on the initial report, while telecom companies like T-Mobile (NASDAQ: ), AT&T Inc (NYSE: ), and Verizon (NYSE: ) took sharp slides.

On the other hand, shares in DISH Network (NASDAQ: ) gained as much as 8.3% on the report. The satellite services provider is already working with Amazon and is expected to start selling its wireless services on Amazon in July.

According to GeekWire, the walkout by corporate and tech employees at Amazon HQ late on Wednesday may have looked like several thousand participants.

""It wasn't an easy crowd to count. It was lunchtime, after all, and despite the free pizza on hand, plenty of people seemed to be milling on the outskirts, stopping for a quick listen as speakers aired grievances over the company's return-to-work policy and its lack of progress on climate change initiatives,"" the report noted.

Amazon Employees for Climate Justice called it a ""large-scale walkout"" with over 1,000 participants at the HQ.

In terms of concrete numbers, organisers said they logged 998 walkout pledges in Seattle and 2,143 worldwide.

""We are here because we want to build a better Amazon,"" a speaker told the gathering.

Amazon mandated its return-to-office policy from May 1, with employees required to be back in offices at least three days per week. The e-commerce giant has also laid off 27,000 employees in two job cut announcements.

However, thousands of corporate and tech employees weren't thrilled to return to work and joined an internal Slack channel to protest the policy.

The e-commerce giant employs more than 65,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region.

Vaishali Kasture, Head–Enterprise, Mid-Market and Global Businesses, AWS India & South Asia (AISPL) is taking on the role of interim leader of Commercial business, AWS India and South Asia.

Chandok's departure comes as AWS, the Cloud arm of e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ), last month announced plans to invest Rs 1,05,600 crore ($12.7 billion) into cloud infrastructure in India by 2030 to meet growing customer demand for cloud services in the country.

2022-06-01, Investing.com,'2000 Deja Vu': Fred Hickey says AI rally is no different than Dot-com bubble,https://in.investing.com/news/2000-deja-vu-fred-hickey-says-ai-rally-is-no-different-than-dotcom-bubble-432SI-3668044,"Fred Hickey, a prominent investor and the editor of the newsletter “The High-Tech Strategist” which is published monthly for the past 34 years, argues that today’s market is resembling the 1999-2000 tech bubble.

He sees the ‘Big Seven’ – Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) – ending up as the Big Six – Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), Dell (NYSE: ), IBM (NYSE: ), Lucent, and Microsoft – did during the tech bubble.

“Substitute “dotcom” with AI – Artificial Intelligence - and 2022 appears to be a mirror image of what occurred twenty-three years ago,” Hickey said in the 425th edition of the High-Tech Strategist.

“Investor psychology never changes and neither do the outcomes of Superbubbles. All the stocks in the crowded trades (NTT, Nifty-Fifty, Big Six) ended up collapsing as investors panicked during the final capitulation phases of the bear markets. It’ll be no different with today’s Big Seven (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla).”

“The only question is the timing of the downfall – and I suspect it’s coming soon,” he added.

The ongoing tech rally has been fueled by the success of Microsoft-based OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Hickey goes on to explain how IBM launched Watson AI in 2011 with the goal of revolutionizing the world.

He then reminds investors that Watson has been “a major failure and loss-leader for IBM for over a decade.”

“Ironically, most tech providers will be hurt by this shift in spending towards AI. Yet, the wildlings are pouring into other so-called AI beneficiaries, when the reality is otherwise,” Hickey concluded"

2022-06-01, IANS,Amazon Ring to pay $5.8 mn over unlawfully accessing consumer videos,https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-ring-to-pay-58-mn-over-unlawfully-accessing-consumer-videos-3667673,"San Francisco, June 1 (IANS) Ring, the Amazon-owned maker of video surveillance devices, will pay $5.8 million in consumer refunds and will be prohibited from profiting from unlawfully accessing consumer videos, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced.

The FTC charged home security camera company Ring with compromising its customers' privacy by allowing any employee or contractor to access consumers' private videos and by failing to implement basic privacy and security protections, enabling hackers to take control of consumers' accounts, cameras, and videos.

Under a proposed order, which must be approved by a federal court, Ring will be required to delete data products such as data, models, and algorithms derived from videos it unlawfully reviewed.

It also will be required to implement a privacy and security program with novel safeguards on human review of videos as well as other stringent security controls, such as multi-factor authentication for both employee and customer accounts, the US agency said in a statement late on Wednesday.

""Ring's disregard for privacy and security exposed consumers to spying and harassment,"" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ""The FTC's order makes clear that putting profit over privacy doesn't pay.""

California-based Ring, which was purchased by Amazon (NASDAQ: ) in February 2018, sells internet-connected, video-enabled home security cameras, doorbells, and related accessories and services.

In a complaint, the FTC said that Ring deceived its customers by failing to restrict employees' and contractors' access to its customers' videos, using customer videos to train algorithms, among other purposes, without consent, and failing to implement security safeguards.

The FTC also said Ring failed to take any steps until January 2018 to adequately notify customers or obtain their consent for extensive human review of customers' private video recordings for various purposes, including training algorithms.

Despite experiencing multiple credential-stuffing attacks in 2017 and 2018, Ring failed to implement common tactics such as multi-factor authentication until 2019.

As a result, hackers continued to exploit account vulnerabilities to access stored videos, live video streams, and account profiles of approximately 55,000 customers, according to the complaint.

The FTC and the Department of Justice said in a statement that they will require Amazon to ""overhaul its deletion practices and implement stringent privacy safeguards"" as the company violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule (COPPA Rule).

According to the complaint, Amazon prevented parents from exercising their deletion rights under the COPPA Rule, kept sensitive voice and geolocation data for years, and used it for its own purposes, while putting data at risk of harm from unnecessary access.

""Amazon's history of misleading parents, keeping children's recordings indefinitely, and flouting parents' deletion requests violated COPPA and sacrificed privacy for profits,"" said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection.

""COPPA does not allow companies to keep children's data forever for any reason, and certainly not to train their algorithms.""

Amazon will be required to delete inactive child accounts and certain voice recordings and geolocation information and will be prohibited from using such data to train its algorithms. The proposed order must be approved by the federal court to go into effect.

According to the complaint, the company ""prominently and repeatedly"" assured its users, including parents, that they could delete voice recordings collected from its Alexa voice assistant and geolocation information collected by the Alexa app.

The company, however, failed to follow through on these promises when it kept some of this information for years and used the data it unlawfully retained to help improve its Alexa algorithm, according to the complaint.

The company claims that its Alexa service and Echo devices are ""designed to protect your privacy"" and that parents and other users can delete geolocation data and voice recordings.

Amazon retained children's recordings indefinitely -- unless a parent requested that this information be deleted, according to the complaint.

And even when a parent sought to delete that information, the FTC said, Amazon failed to delete transcripts of what kids said from all its databases.

Amazon claimed it retained children's voice recordings in order to help it respond to voice commands, allow parents to review them, and to improve Alexa's speech recognition and processing capabilities, according to the complaint.

The FTC said the company failed to put in place an effective system to ensure that it honoured users' data deletion requests and to give parents meaningful notice about deletion.

Even when Amazon discovered its failures to delete geolocation data, the FTC said that Amazon repeatedly failed to fix the problems.

Last quarter, the company's profit surged 26 per cent to $2 billion, and sales rose 19 per cent to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts' forecasts. Nvidia's outlook for the current quarter was also significantly -- about 50 per cent -- higher than analysts' predictions. Its stock is up about 180 per cent so far this year, CNN reported.

""The walkout is on! About 1,816 employees have pledged to walk out around the world so far, with 873 in Seattle. Please join 1,816 of our coworkers (and counting) and pledge to walk out,"" said Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ) and Amazon's Remote Advocacy community leaders.

""Employees need a say in decisions that affect our lives such as the return-to-work mandate, and how our work is being used to accelerate the climate crisis,"" they added.

An Amazon spokesperson told GeekWire that they are always listening and will continue to do so.

""We're happy with how the first month of having more people back in the office has been. There's more energy, collaboration, and connections happening, and we've heard this from lots of employees and the businesses that surround our offices,"" said the company spokesperson.

""We understand that it's going to take time to adjust back to being in the office more and there are a lot of teams at the company working hard to make this transition as smooth as possible for employees,"" the spokesperson added.

However, thousands of corporate and tech employees weren't thrilled to return to work and joined an internal Slack channel to protest the policy.

""This is about Amazon going in the wrong direction, and losing trust. We want what's best for Amazon. Long-term thinking and employee voices are a significant component of the Day 1 culture that's turned Amazon into such a successful company, and we're trying to reignite it,"" Amazon Employees for Climate Justice and Amazon Remote Advocacy said in a statement.

""Day 1"" is a reference to a mantra touted by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021 but remains chairman.

Amazon employs more than 65,000 corporate workers in the Seattle region.
