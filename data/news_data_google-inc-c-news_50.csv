"Dec 18, 2022 00:00", IANS,Google to end ‘geofence warrant’ requests for users’ location data,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-end-geofence-warrant-requests-for-users-location-data-3941318,"New Delhi, Dec 18 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has moved to end a long-running surveillance practice called “geofence warrants”, a practice that allowed law enforcement agencies to use Google’s location data to identify potential criminals. “Geofence warrants” require a provider — like Google — to search its entire reserve of user location data to identify all users or devices located within a geographic area during a time period specified by law enforcement.

According to TechCrunch, the use of “geofence warrants” have increased in recent years which, according to people, are unconstitutional.

Google announced last week that the Timeline feature in Maps helps you remember places you’ve been and is powered by a setting called Location History.

“If you’re among the subset of users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by default), soon your Timeline will be saved right on your device — giving you even more control over your data,” the company informed.

Just like before, you can delete all or part of your information at any time or disable the setting entirely.

Google did not mention “geofence warrants” directly but this move will now force police to seek a search warrant to access a specific device, rather than asking Google for the data.

Geofence warrants have been possible because Google collects and stores specific user location data altogether in a massive database called “Sensorvault.”

Google reported several years ago that geofence warrants make up 25 per cent of all warrants it receives each year.

Police in Minneapolis used a geofence warrant to identify individuals who attended protests following the police killing of George Floyd in early 2021. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said in a blog post that “for now, at least, we’ll take this as a win” .

""These changes would appear to make it much more difficult—if not impossible — for Google to provide mass location data in response to a geofence warrant, a change we’ve been asking Google to implement for years,” said the foundation.

“It’s very welcome news for technology users as we usher in the end of 2022,” the EFF added.

In its transparency report in 2022, Apple (NASDAQ: ) said it received 13 geofence warrants demanding its customers’ location data, but provided no data.

""I am all over the place. I am also on the dark internet,"" Chandrasekhar said at the CNBC-TV18 and Moneycontrol Global AI Conclave on Saturday.

At the Conclave, the minister also mentioned that technological talent, not chip-driven computer power, is the key to India's progress in artificial intelligence (AI).

""Fifteen years ago you measured academic institutions by how many students got hired by Google or went abroad. Now it is about what kind of platforms the students of a particular institution are building for the world,"" Chandrasekhar said.

""Talent is a much more fundamental challenge in AI. We need universities to churn out masters and PhDs in AI. Talent is something that keeps me awake at night. The infrastructure pieces will get solved very quickly,"" he added.

Earlier this week, Chandrasekhar said that there is a serious need for the tech industry and academic institutions to work along with the governments globally in shaping the future pipeline of talent for AI-related jobs.

2022-12-16, IANS,US news publisher sues Google for 'siphoning off' ad revenue via AI tech,https://in.investing.com/news/us-news-publisher-sues-google-for-siphoning-off-ad-revenue-via-ai-tech-3940472,"San Francisco, Dec 16 (IANS) A US-based news publisher has filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against Google (NASDAQ: ), alleging that the tech giant is ""siphoning off"" news publishers' content, their readers and ad revenue via its AI technologies. The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Washington, DC, cited new AI technologies like Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem, reports TechCrunch.

The lawsuit, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, that Google's Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included ""news, magazine and digital publications,"" Helena World Chronicle argued that Google is ""starving the free press"" by sharing publishers'’ content on Google, resulting in loss of ""billions of dollars"" for them.

""When a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a 'Knowledge Panel' to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,"" the complaint read.

""Google compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers’ websites - what Google calls ‘materials shared across the web' - and from 'open source and licensed databases',"" it added.

By 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities, according to the report.

The lawsuit claimed that Google's recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with ""the goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.""

According to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, publishers believe they’ll lose somewhere between 20-40 per cent of their website traffic when Google's AI products are fully rolled out. In addition to damages, the lawsuit asks for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its AI products. Google was yet to comment on the lawsuit.

2022-12-16, IANS,Not the right way to do it: Pichai on laying off 12K Google workers,https://in.investing.com/news/not-the-right-way-to-do-it-pichai-on-laying-off-12k-google-workers-3940437,"San Francisco, Dec 16 (IANS) After almost a year when Google (NASDAQ: ) announced the decision to cut 12,000 jobs, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that the decision to inform employees affected by the layoffs was ""not the right way to do it"". At an all-hands meeting held on Tuesday, Pichai was asked about the decision to lay off so many employees, reports Insider.

""It has been almost one year since we made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce. What impact did this decision have on our growth, P&L, and morale?"" an employee asked Pichai.

In response the CEO said, the layoffs had a ""clear big impact on morale. It's reflected in the comments in Googlegeist and the feedback"".

Googlegeist is the company's internal survey, which measures employee satisfaction on topics such as leadership, product focus, and compensation.

""This is difficult for any company to go through. At Google, we really haven't had a moment quite like that in 25 years,"" Pichai said.

""It became clear if we didn't act, it would have been a worse decision down the line. It would have been a major overhang on the company. I think it would have made it very difficult in a year like this with such a big shift in the world to create the capacity to invest in areas,"" he added.

Executives were also asked whether they had any thoughts on how the layoffs were handled, and Pichai admitted that the company did not handle the cuts as well as it could have.

Pichai, in particular, stated that notifying all concerned employees at the same time, regardless of time zone, was not a good idea, the report mentioned.

""Clearly it's not the right way to do it. I think it's something we could have done differently for sure,"" he said. He added that immediately removing access to laid-off employees' work accounts was ""a very, very difficult decision"".

Google has made numerous smaller, more targeted waves of layoffs since January in areas such as recruiting, Google News, and Google Assistant. Meanwhile, Fortnite maker Epic Games has won its antitrust battle with Google in a landmark case that went on for three years.

The unanimous verdict by a US jury wraps up the legal battle between the tech companies.

The jury found that Google turned its Play Store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, reports The Verge.

The non-immigrant work visa allows US employers to hire foreign workers with specialised skills to work in the country for a specific period of time.

2022-12-14, IANS,Apple will need court order from govts to give phone push notifications,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-will-need-court-order-from-govts-to-give-phone-push-notifications-3937065,"San Francisco, Dec 14 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) will now require law enforcement agencies to obtain a court order before it hands over details of customers’ push notifications. Apple has updated its guidelines for law enforcement agencies, saying that search warrants and court orders are now required for it to give up “The Apple ID associated with” an Apple Push Notification Service token.

“The Apple ID associated with a registered Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token and associated records may be obtained with an order under 18 U.S.C. §2703(d) or a search warrant,” the company said in the update.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Google (NASDAQ: ) already have a policy to require court orders in place.

Last week, US Senator Ron Wyden warned in a letter written to the Justice Department that some unidentified governments around the world are spying on Apple and Google phone users through their push notifications. The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch last week that the company shares Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”

“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden,” according to Google.

According to Apple, when users allow an application they have installed to receive push notifications, an APNs token is generated and registered to that developer and device. “Some apps may have multiple APNs tokens for one account on one device to differentiate between messages and multi-media,” according to the company.

These changes will gradually roll out through the next year on Android and iOS, and you’ll receive a notification when this update comes to your account, Google said.

By 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT), the 30-stock had gained by 173 points or 0.5%, the benchmark gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy gained 0.70%. The main averages on Wall Street closed at fresh 52-week highs, with the S&P 500 touching its highest level since January 2022.

Inflation continues to cool, keeping lid on Treasury yields

Annual headline consumer price growth edged down to 3.1% last month, decelerating from 3.2% in October, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday. Month-on-month, the reading inched up by 0.1%. Economists had forecast the measures at 3.1% and 0.0%, respectively.

The jury found that Google turned its Play Store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, The Verge reported late on Monday.

Epic filed its lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging that Google Play Store practices violated US antitrust laws.

""Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world,"" Epic Games said in a statement.

""It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" the company added.

Wilson White, Google’s VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy, said the company plans to appeal the verdict.

""We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,"" White said in a statement.

""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" the Google spokesperson added.

Epic Games said that over the course of the trial, ""we saw evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores"".

Google imposes a 30 per cent tax on developers simply because they have prevented any viable competitors from emerging to offer better deals.

“And Google executives acknowledged in Court that their offer of a 26 per cent rate on third party payment options is a fake choice for developers,” said Epic Games.

Earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had won the long-drawn antitrust court battle in the US against Epic Games over its App Store policies.

The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the district court's earlier ruling related to Epic Games' antitrust claims in favour of Apple.

However, it also upheld the lower court's judgment in favour of Epic under California's Unfair Competition Law.

Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, as Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after the game maker intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases.

The Fortnite make said that the evidence presented in the Google case ""demonstrates the urgent need for legislation and regulations that address Apple and Google strangleholds over smartphones"".

Inflation, Fed meeting in spotlight

The Federal Open Market Committee is tipped to hold rates at their current range of 5.25% to 5.50% on Wednesday. Much of the focus will likely be the Fed's projections for the economy, inflation, and the number of cuts expected next year.

The meeting will arrived on the heels on fresh data expected to show ongoing slowing in price pressures.

Comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell will also be garnered for a potential push back on market expectations for a sooner rather than later rate cut.

In the wake of last week's jobs data and separate numbers showing the slowest annual rise in underlying price gains in two years in October, markets are now pricing in a nearly 50% chance of a quarter-point rate decrease in borrowing costs as soon as May, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

This feature is powered by a setting called Location History.

""If you’re getting a new phone or are worried about losing your existing one, you can always choose to back up your data to the Cloud so it doesn’t get lost. We’ll automatically encrypt your backed-up data so no one can read it, including Google,"" the tech giant said in a blogpost on Tuesday.

Moreover, the company mentioned that when you first turn on Location History, the auto-delete control will be set to three months by default, meaning any data older than that will be automatically deleted.

Earlier, this option was set to 18 months. For those who want to save memories to their Timeline for a longer period, they can always choose to extend the period or turn off auto-delete controls altogether.

These changes will gradually roll out through the next year on Android and iOS, and you’ll receive a notification when this update comes to your account, Google said.

In another update, the company mentioned that the blue dot, which shows where you are on Google Maps, brings key location controls right to your fingertips.

You will just need to tap it and you'll see whether your Location History or Timeline settings are turned on and whether you’ve given Maps access to your device’s location.

New blue dot controls will start rolling out in the coming weeks on Android and iOS.

“The interactive questions feature turns a passive watching experience into an engaging one, and improves students’ understanding of a subject by providing them with the space to make mistakes, review incorrect answers and assess correct answers at their own pace,” Google said in a statement.

Once students within a class have completed the video activity, educators will have access to a dashboard of key insights based on student engagement levels.

While interactive YouTube video assignments will be beneficial to students, it will also help educators identify concepts that need more instruction time, discover students who may need extra support and also shape future lesson plans, said the company.

Educators are also able to scale individualised support since students will get real-time validation as they answer certain question types in the video activities.

The feature is available to Education Plus and the Teaching and Learning Upgrade users.

The feature is being fully rolled out in the next three days. The tool can be enabled by administrators through the admin console.

The interactive questions feature has been available in beta since March.

By 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT), the 30-stock had gained by 173 points or 0.5%, the benchmark gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy gained 0.70%. The main averages on Wall Street closed at fresh 52-week highs, with the S&P 500 touching its highest level since January 2022.

Inflation continues to cool, keeping lid on Treasury yields

Annual headline consumer price growth edged down to 3.1% last month, decelerating from 3.2% in October, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday. Month-on-month, the reading inched up by 0.1%. Economists had forecast the measures at 3.1% and 0.0%, respectively.

The closely-watched ""core"" figure, which strips out volatile items like food and energy, rose by 4.0% annually, in line with the prior month. On a monthly basis, underlying price gains came in at 0.3%, a marginally faster pace than 0.2% in October. Both matched estimates.

Following the data, bets on rate cut in the first half of the year remained supported, with about 50% of traders betting on cut in May, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Treasury yields fell, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell 3.3 basis points to 4.206%.

Fed kicks off two-day meeting

Epic Games wins Google antitrust lawsuit

A federal jury has found against Google in a high-profile antitrust lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite""-maker Epic Games, sending shares in the tech giant's parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) lower.

Epic had argued that the tech giant essentially used its Play app store as an illegal monopoly that unfairly charged high fees on developers and suppressed competition in the Android app market. According to a court filing, the jury ruled in favor of Epic on all counts.

The court will begin to decide what changes Google will need to put in place in January. In a statement quoted by Reuters, Google said it will appeal the ruling.

2022-12-12, IANS,Fortnite maker Epic Games wins antitrust battle against Google,https://in.investing.com/news/fortnite-maker-epic-games-wins-antitrust-battle-against-google-3933850,"San Francisco, Dec 12 (IANS) Fortnite maker Epic Games has won its antitrust battle with Google (NASDAQ: ) in a landmark case that went on for three years.The unanimous verdict by a US jury wraps up the legal battle between the tech companies. The jury found that Google turned its Play Store and Google Play Billing service into an illegal monopoly, The Verge reported late on Monday.

Epic filed its lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging that Google Play Store practices violated US antitrust laws.

""Today’s verdict is a win for all app developers and consumers around the world,"" Epic Games said in a statement.

""It proves that Google’s app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation,"" the company added.

Wilson White, Google’s VP of Government Affairs and Public Policy, said the company plans to appeal the verdict.

""We plan to challenge the verdict. Android and Google Play provide more choice and openness than any other major mobile platform,"" White said in a statement.

""We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners, and the broader Android ecosystem,"" the Google spokesperson added.

Epic Games said that over the course of the trial, ""we saw evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores"".

Google imposes a 30 per cent tax on developers simply because they have prevented any viable competitors from emerging to offer better deals.

“And Google executives acknowledged in Court that their offer of a 26 per cent rate on third party payment options is a fake choice for developers,” said Epic Games.

Earlier this year, Apple (NASDAQ: ) had won the long-drawn antitrust court battle in the US against Epic Games over its App Store policies.

The US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the district court's earlier ruling related to Epic Games' antitrust claims in favour of Apple.

However, it also upheld the lower court's judgment in favour of Epic under California's Unfair Competition Law.

Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, as Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store after the game maker intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases.

The Fortnite make said that the evidence presented in the Google case ""demonstrates the urgent need for legislation and regulations that address Apple and Google strangleholds over smartphones"".

By 16:00 ET (21:00 GMT), the benchmark S&P 500 was up 0.3% and 30-stock gained 0.43%, 157 points, with both indexes notching an intraday high. The tech-heavy rose 0.20%.

Inflation, Fed meeting in spotlight

The Federal Open Market Committee is tipped to hold rates at their current range of 5.25% to 5.50% on Wednesday. Much of the focus will likely be the Fed's projections for the economy, inflation, and the number of cuts expected next year.

The meeting will arrived on the heels on fresh data expected to show ongoing slowing in price pressures.

Comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell will also be garnered for a potential push back on market expectations for a sooner rather than later rate cut.

In the wake of last week's jobs data and separate numbers showing the slowest annual rise in underlying price gains in two years in October, markets are now pricing in a nearly 50% chance of a quarter-point rate decrease in borrowing costs as soon as May, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

Cigna scraps Humana tie-up talks

U.S. health insurer Cigna (NYSE: ) has ended its drive to acquire peer Humana (NYSE: ), according to multiple media reports, pulling the plug on a deal that would have created an insurance behemoth worth over $140 billion.

The reports said neither Cigna nor Humana could agree on a price, while regulatory concerns and a fall in their share prices are also believed to have soured sentiment for a deal.

The abandoned talks come as Connecticut-based Cigna announced that it is aiming to roll out an additional $10B in share buybacks.

Macy's jumps on buyout fever

Macy's (NYSE: ) shares also surged more than 19% after the department store retailer reportedly received a $5.8 billion buyout offer from real estate-focused investing business Arkhouse Management and global asset manager Brigade Capital Management.

Globalfoundries Inc (NASDAQ: ), Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: ) led chips higher, with the latter up more than 8% after Citi resumed coverage on the chipmaker with a buy rating.

Occidental Petroleum in deal for CrownRock as consolidation in energy continues

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: ) said Monday it agreed a deal to buy shale oil driller Crownrock for $12B as the oil major seeks to expand its presence in the Midland basis.

The move underscored an ongoing consolidation in the energy sector following Exxon Mobil (NYSE: )'s $6B takeover deal for shale rival Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) earlier this year.

Elsewhere in the energy sector, Hess Corporation (NYSE: ) and Baker Hughes Co (NASDAQ: ) were among the top gainers, up more than 1% even as traded sluggish amid cautious trading ahead of the Fed meeting this week.

“All the user prompts and outputs in the video are real, shortened for brevity. The video illustrates what the multimodal user experiences built with Gemini could look like. We made it to inspire developers,” he said.

Google on Wednesday spiced up the generative AI race with introducing Gemini, its most capable and general model yet with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks, in three iterations.

The first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimised for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano.

Google’s AI chatbot Bard will use a fine-tuned version of Gemini Pro for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more.

It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories, and “we plan to expand to different modalities and support new languages and locations in the near future,” said Google.

The company also brought Gemini to Pixel 8 Pro, powering new features like Summarise in the Recorder app and rolling out Smart Reply in Gboard, starting with WhatsApp, with more messaging apps coming next year.

In the coming months, Gemini will be available in more of Google products and services like Search, Ads, Chrome and Duet AI.

“The root cause of both incidents was an atypical pattern of email traffic, resulting in high resource utilization in this system and delays in email delivery,” Google said in an update.

The company plans to “implement rate limit mechanisms in our systems” to improve things going forward.

Gmail’s core message processing system experienced delays for email delivery on November 30 and December 1 for a cumulative duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes.

“To our Gmail customers whose email delivery was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability,” said the company.

On both occasions, Google engineers were alerted to the delays via monitoring alerts.

“We immediately began mitigation efforts, including increasing capacity for the impacted regions. We have also implemented reasonable limits to prevent such an atypical traffic pattern from recurring,” said Google.

To stop such outages from happening again, Google is implement rate limit mechanisms in its systems.

The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Wyden said that Apple and Google can be “secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”

Last month, Apple sent ""threat notifications"" to individuals whose accounts are in nearly 150 countries, including in India. Apple is sending a team of experts to delve deep into the issue of some Indian politicians receiving threats notifications last month, warning them of state-sponsored hackers targeting their devices.

The threat notification probe is currently being conducted by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).

“Apple and Google should be permitted to be transparent about the legal demands they receive, particularly from foreign governments, just as the companies regularly notify users about other types of government demands for data,” Wyden wrote in the letter.

These companies should be permitted to generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice, to publish aggregate statistics about the number of demands they receive, and unless temporarily gagged by a court, to notify specific customers about demands for their data, he added.

The letter, however, did not specify which foreign governments have asked Apple and Google for push notification information. “Apple is committed to transparency and we have long been a supporter of efforts to ensure that providers are able to disclose as much information as possible to their users,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information and now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests,” the spokesperson added.

A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company shares Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”

“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden,” according to Google.

Google’s AI chatbot Bard will use a fine-tuned version of Gemini Pro for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more.

It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories, and “we plan to expand to different modalities and support new languages and locations in the near future,” said Google.

In the coming months, Gemini will be available in more of Google products and services like Search, Ads, Chrome and Duet AI.

“These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realisation of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year,” said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai,.

Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including the colleagues at Google Research.

“It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalise and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video,” said Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind.

While Gemini Ultra is the largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks, Gemini Pro is the model for scaling across a wide range of tasks and Gemini Nano is for on-device tasks.

“With a score of 90 per cent, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities,” said Google.

From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.

According to Google, Gemini 1.0’s sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written and visual information.

“Our first version of Gemini can understand, explain and generate high-quality code in the world’s most popular programming languages, like Python, Java, C++, and Go,” said the company.

Gemini can also be used as the engine for more advanced coding systems.

The company trained Gemini 1.0 at scale on its AI-optimised infrastructure using Google’s in-house designed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) v4 and v5e.

“Today, we’re announcing the most powerful, efficient and scalable TPU system to date, Cloud TPU v5p, designed for training cutting-edge AI models,” said Google.

 other nations",https://in.investing.com/news/google-pulls-17-deceptive-android-loan-apps-targeting-users-in-india-other-nations-3926952,"New Delhi, Dec 6 (IANS) Researchers on Wednesday said that they found 18 deceptive Android loan apps that disguised themselves as genuine personal loan services. Google (NASDAQ: ) has removed 17 of these apps, targeting users in India and other countries, from their platform.

According to the report by ESET Research, these apps had more than 12 million downloads globally from Google Play before their removal.

Such deceptive Android loan apps are named as 'SpyLoan apps'.

“These malicious applications exploit the trust that users place in legitimate loan providers, using sophisticated techniques to deceive people and steal a very wide range of personal information,” said ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko, who uncovered many of the SpyLoan apps.

According to the report, the originators of these apps, who blackmail and harass their victims, even with death threats, operate mainly in Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Colombia, Peru, the Philippines, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and Singapore.

Other than data harvesting and blackmail, these services present a form of modern-day digital usury, which refers to the charging of excessive interest rates on loans, taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.

The total annual cost (TAC) of such loans, according to victims of these applications, is significantly more than stated, and the loan period is much shorter than stated.

In some cases, borrowers were pressured to pay off their loans in five days, instead of the stated 91 days, and the TAC of a loan was anywhere between 160 per cent and 340 per cent, the report mentioned.

The researchers have traced the origins of the SpyLoan scheme back to 2020.

When a SpyLoan app is installed, the user is required to agree the terms of service and provide extensive permissions to access sensitive data saved on the device.

According to the privacy policies of these apps, if those permissions are not granted, the loan will not be provided. To complete the loan application process, users are also compelled to provide extensive personal information, the report noted.

2022-12-07, IANS,‘Atypical pattern’ of email traffic behind 2 Gmail outages: Google,https://in.investing.com/news/atypical-pattern-of-email-traffic-behind-2-gmail-outages-google-3928315,"New Delhi, Dec 7 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has revealed that Gmail’s two outages last week were due to “an atypical pattern of email traffic.”According to Google’s incident report, the tech giant runs a core message processing system that is responsible for delivering, monitoring, queuing, and receiving email messages.

“The root cause of both incidents was an atypical pattern of email traffic, resulting in high resource utilization in this system and delays in email delivery,” Google said in an update.

The company plans to “implement rate limit mechanisms in our systems” to improve things going forward.

Gmail’s core message processing system experienced delays for email delivery on November 30 and December 1 for a cumulative duration of 6 hours and 23 minutes.

“To our Gmail customers whose email delivery was impacted during this disruption, we sincerely apologize. This is not the level of quality and reliability we strive to offer you, and we are taking immediate steps to improve the platform’s performance and availability,” said the company.

On both occasions, Google engineers were alerted to the delays via monitoring alerts.

“We immediately began mitigation efforts, including increasing capacity for the impacted regions. We have also implemented reasonable limits to prevent such an atypical traffic pattern from recurring,” said Google.

To stop such outages from happening again, Google is implement rate limit mechanisms in its systems.

The letter said that his office received a tip in 2022 that government agencies in foreign countries were demanding smartphone “push” notification records from Google and Apple.

“My staff have been investigating this tip for the past year, which included contacting Apple and Google. In response to that query, the companies told my staff that information about this practice is restricted from public release by the government,” the letter further read.

Push notifications are the instant alerts delivered to smartphone users by apps, such as a notification about a new text message or a news update. They aren't sent directly from the app provider to users’ smartphones. Wyden said that Apple and Google can be “secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”

Last month, Apple sent ""threat notifications"" to individuals whose accounts are in nearly 150 countries, including in India. Apple is sending a team of experts to delve deep into the issue of some Indian politicians receiving threats notifications last month, warning them of state-sponsored hackers targeting their devices.

The threat notification probe is currently being conducted by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).

“Apple and Google should be permitted to be transparent about the legal demands they receive, particularly from foreign governments, just as the companies regularly notify users about other types of government demands for data,” Wyden wrote in the letter.

These companies should be permitted to generally reveal whether they have been compelled to facilitate this surveillance practice, to publish aggregate statistics about the number of demands they receive, and unless temporarily gagged by a court, to notify specific customers about demands for their data, he added.

The letter, however, did not specify which foreign governments have asked Apple and Google for push notification information. “Apple is committed to transparency and we have long been a supporter of efforts to ensure that providers are able to disclose as much information as possible to their users,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.

“In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information and now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests,” the spokesperson added.

A Google spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company shares Wyden’s “commitment to keeping users informed about these requests.”

“We were the first major company to publish a public transparency report sharing the number and types of government requests for user data we receive, including the requests referred to by Senator Wyden,” according to Google.

2022-12-06, IANS,Google introduces Gemini GenAI model for highly complex tasks,https://in.investing.com/news/google-introduces-gemini-genai-model-for-highly-complex-tasks-3927344,"New Delhi, Dec 6 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday spiced up the generative AI race with introducing Gemini, its most capable and general model yet with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks, in three iterations.The first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimised for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano.

Google’s AI chatbot Bard will use a fine-tuned version of Gemini Pro for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more.

It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories, and “we plan to expand to different modalities and support new languages and locations in the near future,” said Google.

The company also brought Gemini to Pixel 8 Pro, powering new features like Summarise in the Recorder app and rolling out in Smart Reply in Gboard, starting with WhatsApp, with more messaging apps coming next year.

In the coming months, Gemini will be available in more of Google products and services like Search, Ads, Chrome and Duet AI.

“These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realisation of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year,” said Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai,.

Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including the colleagues at Google Research.

“It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalise and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video,” said Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind.

While Gemini Ultra is the largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks, Gemini Pro is the model for scaling across a wide range of tasks and Gemini Nano is for on-device tasks.

“With a score of 90 per cent, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities,” said Google.

From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development.

According to Google, Gemini 1.0’s sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written and visual information.

“Our first version of Gemini can understand, explain and generate high-quality code in the world’s most popular programming languages, like Python, Java, C++, and Go,” said the company.

Gemini can also be used as the engine for more advanced coding systems.

The company trained Gemini 1.0 at scale on its AI-optimised infrastructure using Google’s in-house designed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) v4 and v5e.

“Today, we’re announcing the most powerful, efficient and scalable TPU system to date, Cloud TPU v5p, designed for training cutting-edge AI models,” said Google.

2022-12-06, IANS,"Google pulls 17 deceptive Android loan apps targeting users in India,
 other nations",https://in.investing.com/news/google-pulls-17-deceptive-android-loan-apps-targeting-users-in-india-other-nations-3926952,"New Delhi, Dec 6 (IANS) Researchers on Wednesday said that they found 18 deceptive Android loan apps that disguised themselves as genuine personal loan services. Google (NASDAQ: ) has removed 17 of these apps, targeting users in India and other countries, from their platform.

According to the report by ESET Research, these apps had more than 12 million downloads globally from Google Play before their removal.

Such deceptive Android loan apps are named as 'SpyLoan apps'.

“These malicious applications exploit the trust that users place in legitimate loan providers, using sophisticated techniques to deceive people and steal a very wide range of personal information,” said ESET researcher Lukas Stefanko, who uncovered many of the SpyLoan apps.

According to the report, the originators of these apps, who blackmail and harass their victims, even with death threats, operate mainly in Mexico, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Colombia, Peru, the Philippines, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and Singapore.

Other than data harvesting and blackmail, these services present a form of modern-day digital usury, which refers to the charging of excessive interest rates on loans, taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.

The total annual cost (TAC) of such loans, according to victims of these applications, is significantly more than stated, and the loan period is much shorter than stated.

In some cases, borrowers were pressured to pay off their loans in five days, instead of the stated 91 days, and the TAC of a loan was anywhere between 160 per cent and 340 per cent, the report mentioned.

The researchers have traced the origins of the SpyLoan scheme back to 2020.

When a SpyLoan app is installed, the user is required to agree the terms of service and provide extensive permissions to access sensitive data saved on the device.

According to the privacy policies of these apps, if those permissions are not granted, the loan will not be provided. To complete the loan application process, users are also compelled to provide extensive personal information, the report noted.

“To help make text classifiers more robust and efficient, we’ve developed a novel, multilingual text vectorizer called RETVec that helps models achieve state-of-the-art classification performance and drastically reduces computational cost,” the company said.

Systems such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Play rely on text classification models to identify harmful content including phishing attacks, inappropriate comments, and scams.

These types of texts are harder for machine learning models to classify because bad actors rely on adversarial text manipulations to actively attempt to evade the classifiers.

“For example, they will use homoglyphs, invisible characters, and keyword stuffing to bypass defenses,” said the tech giant.

Due to its novel architecture, RETVec works out-of-the-box on every language and all characters without the need for text preprocessing, making it the ideal candidate for on-device, web, and large-scale text classification deployments.

“Models trained with RETVec exhibit faster inference speed due to its compact representation. Having smaller models reduces computational costs and decreases latency, which is critical for large-scale applications and on-device models,” the tech giant said.

RETVec is a novel open-source text vectorizer that allows people to build more resilient and efficient server-side and on-device text classifiers.

The Gmail spam filter uses it to help protect Gmail inboxes against malicious emails, said Google.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., the parent company of the internet colossus Google, stands as a testament to the transformative power of technology and innovation. With a sprawling empire that encompasses everything from search and advertising to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Alphabet has cemented its status as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Yet, in the ever-shifting landscape of tech, even giants must adapt or risk obsolescence. This deep-dive analysis, drawing from recent analyst reports, peels back the layers of Alphabet's business to reveal a company at a crossroads, facing both unprecedented opportunity and daunting challenge.

Market Performance and Product Segments

Alphabet's stock, trading under NASDAQ:GOOGL, has been the subject of intense scrutiny, with analysts from Barclays (LON: ), RBC Capital Markets, KeyBanc, JMP Securities, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), J.P. Morgan, Citi Research, and Wedbush offering insights into the company's trajectory. The consensus is clear: Alphabet is a heavyweight in the tech industry, with a market capitalization that hovers around the $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion range.

The company's diverse portfolio is a source of strength. Google Search remains the crown jewel, with Barclays projecting a staggering $74 billion in search revenue for 2024, accounting for a significant slice of the market. YouTube continues to be a powerhouse in digital video, and despite some deceleration, Google Cloud is a formidable player in the cloud services arena, with Morgan Stanley highlighting the platform's potential in the GPU IaaS market.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

Alphabet is not without its rivals. The company's cloud computing segment, for example, is locked in a fierce battle with competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure. KeyBanc notes that Google Cloud's missed operating margin expectations and potential market share loss to Azure are concerning. However, Alphabet's leadership in search and AI is seen as unshaken, with the company expected to see mid-teens EPS growth in the coming years.

The regulatory environment also looms large over Alphabet, with ongoing legal proceedings such as the Google v. DoJ trial posing risks to its business operations. The outcomes of these cases could have far-reaching implications for the company's search unit economics and overall market position.

Customer Base and Management Strategy

Alphabet's customer base is vast and varied, stretching across virtually every sector of the economy. The company's strategy has been to leverage its strengths in AI and search technology to maintain and grow this base. Investments in Generative AI, as highlighted by RBC Capital Markets and JMP Securities, are a testament to Alphabet's commitment to innovation. These advancements are expected to drive the company's market position and foster enterprise adoption.

Potential Impacts of External Factors

External factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, can significantly impact Alphabet's performance. J.P. Morgan notes the company's resilience in online advertising, buoyed by AI and ad tech improvements. However, broader market challenges could affect the online advertising landscape, a concern echoed by Citi Research.

Upcoming Product Launches

While specific upcoming product launches are not detailed in the summaries, the focus on Generative AI suggests that Alphabet is poised to introduce new, innovative offerings that integrate this technology across its services.

Stock Performance

Alphabet's stock performance, while not immune to fluctuations, has generally been viewed favorably by analysts. Barclays, for example, has set a price target of $180, reflecting confidence in the company's growth potential. This sentiment is shared by JMP Securities, which increased its price target from $138 to $140 based on Alphabet's revenue and AI improvements.

Bear Case

Is Alphabet's cloud segment losing ground to competitors?

Alphabet's cloud business has been a mixed bag. While it's a significant contributor to the company's top line, concerns have been raised about its performance relative to competitors like Microsoft Azure. KeyBanc pointed out missed operating margin expectations and a perceived loss of market share to Azure. This could signal a need for Alphabet to double down on its investments to regain its footing in the cloud market.

Can legal challenges derail Alphabet's growth trajectory?

Legal challenges are a dark cloud over Alphabet's otherwise bright outlook. The ongoing Department of Justice trial and other regulatory hurdles pose risks to the company's core search business. Barclays and other analysts have noted the potential for these proceedings to necessitate changes in Alphabet's search unit economics, which could, in turn, impact profitability and market position.

Bull Case

How will Generative AI shape Alphabet's future?

Generative AI is poised to be a game-changer for Alphabet. RBC Capital Markets and JMP Securities have highlighted Alphabet's investments in this area, with the integration of Generative AI expected to enhance the company's offerings and drive long-term search performance. This technological edge could solidify Alphabet's dominance in various sectors, from advertising to cloud services.

Will Alphabet's ad business continue to thrive amid market shifts?

Despite the broader challenges in the online advertising market, Alphabet's ad business has shown resilience and strength. Citi Research and J.P. Morgan have underscored the company's momentum in online ads, driven by AI and technological advancements. With a stable macroeconomic backdrop and continued innovation, Alphabet's advertising revenues are expected to maintain an upward trajectory.

The upcoming events, which were not publicly announced, would have marked Google's most important product launch of the year, after it strained its computing resources and merged large teams to pursue OpenAI urgently, the report noted.

Gemini is designed to handle a wide range of applications, merging various sorts of data such as images and text for more advanced tasks.

In June, Google's DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that Gemini would be more capable than OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Hassabis mentioned the engineers are using techniques from the AI programme AlphaGo -- which was the first to defeat a champion human player of the board game Go -- to make Gemini. Gemini is likely to bring improvements to Google's existing AI and AI-enhanced products too, like Bard, Google Assistant and Search.

This new AI system was first teased at Google's developer conference in May when the company announced the new AI projects.

The Google case was filed under California’s Private Attorneys General Act.

“The 2016 lawsuit was among the first glimpses of employee activism that swept through the tech industry over the past seven years,” the report said late on Friday.

“The purpose of the Act is to punish the companies, rather than compensate employees, the report said.

“While we strongly believe in the legitimacy of our policies, after nearly eight years of litigation, Google decided that resolution of the matter, without any admission of wrongdoing, is in the best interest of everyone,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Strategic and Tactical Tips for Maximizing Success on BuySellVouchers

Key Considerations for a Successful Reselling Venture:

Understanding the Basics

Before diving in, grasp the fundamentals. Familiarize yourself with the types of gift cards, the demand and supply dynamics, accepted cryptocurrencies, and the BuySellVouchers system. Understanding these elements lays the foundation for a successful reselling venture.

Customize Your Approach: Picking the Right Strategy

In gift card trading, there are various strategies and approaches. Among them, well-known strategies such as “Flipping” and “Arbitrage” can be mentioned. Evaluate, plan, and choose the trading strategy that suits you best.

Choosing the Right Cryptocurrency

Choosing the right cryptocurrency for transactions is crucial. While Tether TRC20 and Bitcoin are widely accepted, it’s important to be mindful of transaction fees and processing times. Evaluate alternative options based on your preferences and the dynamics of the market.

Research and Identify Profitable Gift Cards

Conduct thorough market research to identify currently sought-after gift cards. Popular options often include significant retailers, gaming platforms, and streaming services. This information is easily accessible and analyzable by clicking on the ‘Sold’ filter on the main page, providing quick results on top-selling products. Stay updated on trends to adapt your inventory accordingly.

Stay Informed About Cryptocurrency Market Trends

Stay updated on cryptocurrency trends, market fluctuations, and regulatory changes. Being informed empowers you to make sound decisions and adapt your reselling strategy to evolving market conditions. Evaluate the value trend of cryptocurrencies and consider whether it is more profitable to exchange gift cards for Bitcoin with a floating value or for a stablecoin like Tether TRC20. If there is a sharp drop in the value of cryptocurrencies in the market, it’s wise to cash out gift cards through stablecoins. Conversely, if the cryptocurrency is on the rise, your options may include Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum.

Implement Marketing Strategies

Effectively market your gift cards on BuySellVouchers and other platforms. Leverage social media, online forums, and cryptocurrency communities to reach potential buyers. Promoting your BuySellVouchers seller account in various communities and creating a solid online presence can significantly boost your sales.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,Oracle shares edge down in mixed market conditions,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-shares-edge-down-in-mixed-market-conditions-93CH-3918860,"In recent trading sessions, Oracle Corp . (NYSE: ) has experienced a slight decline amid a landscape of fluctuating market movements. On Wednesday, the technology giant's shares dipped by a modest 0.03%, closing at $116.21. This marginal drop occurred against a backdrop of mixed market performance, with the inching up by 0.04%, while the S&P 500 saw a decline of 0.09%. This marks Oracle's second day in a row of stock price decreases.

Despite the recent dips, Oracle's current stock price stands robust when compared to its industry counterparts such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which closed at $378.85, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), which ended at $136.40. However, Oracle has yet to reclaim its June high of $127.54. Additionally, the company's trading volume has been notably lower than usual, trailing the 50-day average by more than 1 million shares.

Investors may be keeping a watchful eye on Oracle's performance as it navigates through the dynamic market conditions. While the company's recent stock movements have been relatively small, they are occurring within a broader context of market uncertainty where even minor changes can signal investor sentiment and broader economic trends.

InvestingPro Insights

In light of Oracle Corp.'s recent market activity, certain metrics from InvestingPro provide additional context for investors. Oracle's market capitalization stands at a substantial $318.34 billion, and the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 33.54, which adjusts to 31.25 for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. This suggests a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, an InvestingPro Tip to consider for those evaluating the stock's current price.

Additionally, Oracle's revenue growth of 15.41% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 reflects a solid performance in the technology sector. Despite the stock's recent dip, Oracle's dividend yield is 1.38%, with a notable dividend growth of 25.0% over the last twelve months, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders—a factor that has been consistent, as Oracle has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years.

2022-12-05, IANS,Google develops AI-powered spam detection to make Gmail safer,https://in.investing.com/news/google-develops-aipowered-spam-detection-to-make-gmail-safer-3925076,"New Delhi, Dec 5 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has developed an AI-powered spam detection system that can help spot “adversarial text manipulations” like emails with special characters, emojis, typos and other characters that easily bypassed Gmail defenses.Touted as “one of the largest defense upgrades in recent years,” the Google upgrade comes in the form of a new text classification system called RETVec (Resilient and Efficient Text Vectorizer).

“To help make text classifiers more robust and efficient, we’ve developed a novel, multilingual text vectorizer called RETVec that helps models achieve state-of-the-art classification performance and drastically reduces computational cost,” the company said.

Systems such as Gmail, YouTube and Google Play rely on text classification models to identify harmful content including phishing attacks, inappropriate comments, and scams.

These types of texts are harder for machine learning models to classify because bad actors rely on adversarial text manipulations to actively attempt to evade the classifiers.

“For example, they will use homoglyphs, invisible characters, and keyword stuffing to bypass defenses,” said the tech giant.

Due to its novel architecture, RETVec works out-of-the-box on every language and all characters without the need for text preprocessing, making it the ideal candidate for on-device, web, and large-scale text classification deployments.

“Models trained with RETVec exhibit faster inference speed due to its compact representation. Having smaller models reduces computational costs and decreases latency, which is critical for large-scale applications and on-device models,” the tech giant said.

RETVec is a novel open-source text vectorizer that allows people to build more resilient and efficient server-side and on-device text classifiers.

The Gmail spam filter uses it to help protect Gmail inboxes against malicious emails, said Google.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., the parent company of the internet colossus Google, stands as a testament to the transformative power of technology and innovation. With a sprawling empire that encompasses everything from search and advertising to cloud computing and artificial intelligence, Alphabet has cemented its status as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Yet, in the ever-shifting landscape of tech, even giants must adapt or risk obsolescence. This deep-dive analysis, drawing from recent analyst reports, peels back the layers of Alphabet's business to reveal a company at a crossroads, facing both unprecedented opportunity and daunting challenge.

Market Performance and Product Segments

Alphabet's stock, trading under NASDAQ:GOOGL, has been the subject of intense scrutiny, with analysts from Barclays (LON: ), RBC Capital Markets, KeyBanc, JMP Securities, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), J.P. Morgan, Citi Research, and Wedbush offering insights into the company's trajectory. The consensus is clear: Alphabet is a heavyweight in the tech industry, with a market capitalization that hovers around the $1.5 trillion to $1.7 trillion range.

The company's diverse portfolio is a source of strength. Google Search remains the crown jewel, with Barclays projecting a staggering $74 billion in search revenue for 2024, accounting for a significant slice of the market. YouTube continues to be a powerhouse in digital video, and despite some deceleration, Google Cloud is a formidable player in the cloud services arena, with Morgan Stanley highlighting the platform's potential in the GPU IaaS market.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

Alphabet is not without its rivals. The company's cloud computing segment, for example, is locked in a fierce battle with competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure. KeyBanc notes that Google Cloud's missed operating margin expectations and potential market share loss to Azure are concerning. However, Alphabet's leadership in search and AI is seen as unshaken, with the company expected to see mid-teens EPS growth in the coming years.

The regulatory environment also looms large over Alphabet, with ongoing legal proceedings such as the Google v. DoJ trial posing risks to its business operations. The outcomes of these cases could have far-reaching implications for the company's search unit economics and overall market position.

Customer Base and Management Strategy

Alphabet's customer base is vast and varied, stretching across virtually every sector of the economy. The company's strategy has been to leverage its strengths in AI and search technology to maintain and grow this base. Investments in Generative AI, as highlighted by RBC Capital Markets and JMP Securities, are a testament to Alphabet's commitment to innovation. These advancements are expected to drive the company's market position and foster enterprise adoption.

Potential Impacts of External Factors

External factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, can significantly impact Alphabet's performance. J.P. Morgan notes the company's resilience in online advertising, buoyed by AI and ad tech improvements. However, broader market challenges could affect the online advertising landscape, a concern echoed by Citi Research.

Upcoming Product Launches

While specific upcoming product launches are not detailed in the summaries, the focus on Generative AI suggests that Alphabet is poised to introduce new, innovative offerings that integrate this technology across its services.

Stock Performance

Alphabet's stock performance, while not immune to fluctuations, has generally been viewed favorably by analysts. Barclays, for example, has set a price target of $180, reflecting confidence in the company's growth potential. This sentiment is shared by JMP Securities, which increased its price target from $138 to $140 based on Alphabet's revenue and AI improvements.

Bear Case

Is Alphabet's cloud segment losing ground to competitors?

Alphabet's cloud business has been a mixed bag. While it's a significant contributor to the company's top line, concerns have been raised about its performance relative to competitors like Microsoft Azure. KeyBanc pointed out missed operating margin expectations and a perceived loss of market share to Azure. This could signal a need for Alphabet to double down on its investments to regain its footing in the cloud market.

Can legal challenges derail Alphabet's growth trajectory?

Legal challenges are a dark cloud over Alphabet's otherwise bright outlook. The ongoing Department of Justice trial and other regulatory hurdles pose risks to the company's core search business. Barclays and other analysts have noted the potential for these proceedings to necessitate changes in Alphabet's search unit economics, which could, in turn, impact profitability and market position.

Bull Case

How will Generative AI shape Alphabet's future?

Generative AI is poised to be a game-changer for Alphabet. RBC Capital Markets and JMP Securities have highlighted Alphabet's investments in this area, with the integration of Generative AI expected to enhance the company's offerings and drive long-term search performance. This technological edge could solidify Alphabet's dominance in various sectors, from advertising to cloud services.

Will Alphabet's ad business continue to thrive amid market shifts?

Despite the broader challenges in the online advertising market, Alphabet's ad business has shown resilience and strength. Citi Research and J.P. Morgan have underscored the company's momentum in online ads, driven by AI and technological advancements. With a stable macroeconomic backdrop and continued innovation, Alphabet's advertising revenues are expected to maintain an upward trajectory.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Dominance in search and online advertising.

Significant investments in Generative AI.

Diverse product portfolio with a broad customer base.

Weaknesses:

Challenges in cloud computing segment competitiveness.

Legal and regulatory risks.

Reliance (NS: ) on advertising revenue in a volatile market.

Growth potential in cloud services, especially GPU IaaS.

Expansion of AI capabilities across products and services.

The upcoming events, which were not publicly announced, would have marked Google's most important product launch of the year, after it strained its computing resources and merged large teams to pursue OpenAI urgently, the report noted.

Gemini is designed to handle a wide range of applications, merging various sorts of data such as images and text for more advanced tasks.

In June, Google's DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said that Gemini would be more capable than OpenAI's ChatGPT.

Hassabis mentioned the engineers are using techniques from the AI programme AlphaGo -- which was the first to defeat a champion human player of the board game Go -- to make Gemini. Gemini is likely to bring improvements to Google's existing AI and AI-enhanced products too, like Bard, Google Assistant and Search.

This new AI system was first teased at Google's developer conference in May when the company announced the new AI projects.

2022-12-02, IANS,Google reaches $27 mn settlement with employees over unfair labour practices,https://in.investing.com/news/google-reaches-27-mn-settlement-with-employees-over-unfair-labour-practices-3922018,"San Francisco, Dec 2 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ) has reached a $27 million settlement with employees who accused it of unfair labour practices, the media reported.According to a report in Semafor that looked into California state court documents, this is a record for the largest agreement of its kind.

The Google case was filed under California’s Private Attorneys General Act.

“The 2016 lawsuit was among the first glimpses of employee activism that swept through the tech industry over the past seven years,” the report said late on Friday.

Most of the settlement, which is still subject to court approval, will go to the state, with around 100,000 Google employees getting around $20 to $70 each, depending on how long they’ve worked at the company.

“The purpose of the Act is to punish the companies, rather than compensate employees, the report said.

“While we strongly believe in the legitimacy of our policies, after nearly eight years of litigation, Google decided that resolution of the matter, without any admission of wrongdoing, is in the best interest of everyone,” a Google spokesperson was quoted as saying.

The lawsuit was filed after the termination of a worker at Google-owned Nest, who was fired for posting complaints about the company’s management on Facebook (NASDAQ: ).

Understanding the Basics

Customize Your Approach: Picking the Right Strategy

In gift card trading, there are various strategies and approaches. Among them, well-known strategies such as “Flipping” and “Arbitrage” can be mentioned. Evaluate, plan, and choose the trading strategy that suits you best.

Choosing the Right Cryptocurrency

Choosing the right cryptocurrency for transactions is crucial. While Tether TRC20 and Bitcoin are widely accepted, it’s important to be mindful of transaction fees and processing times. Evaluate alternative options based on your preferences and the dynamics of the market.

Research and Identify Profitable Gift Cards

Conduct thorough market research to identify currently sought-after gift cards. Popular options often include significant retailers, gaming platforms, and streaming services. This information is easily accessible and analyzable by clicking on the ‘Sold’ filter on the main page, providing quick results on top-selling products. Stay updated on trends to adapt your inventory accordingly.

Stay Informed About Cryptocurrency Market Trends

Evaluate the value trend of cryptocurrencies and consider whether it is more profitable to exchange gift cards for Bitcoin with a floating value or for a stablecoin like Tether TRC20. If there is a sharp drop in the value of cryptocurrencies in the market, it’s wise to cash out gift cards through stablecoins. Conversely, if the cryptocurrency is on the rise, your options may include Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum.

Effectively market your gift cards on BuySellVouchers and other platforms. Leverage social media, online forums, and cryptocurrency communities to reach potential buyers.

2022-11-30, Investing.com,Oracle shares edge down in mixed market conditions,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-shares-edge-down-in-mixed-market-conditions-93CH-3918860,"In recent trading sessions, Oracle Corp . (NYSE: ) has experienced a slight decline amid a landscape of fluctuating market movements. On Wednesday, the technology giant's shares dipped by a modest 0.03%, closing at $116.21. This marginal drop occurred against a backdrop of mixed market performance, with the inching up by 0.04%, while the S&P 500 saw a decline of 0.09%. This marks Oracle's second day in a row of stock price decreases.

Despite the recent dips, Oracle's current stock price stands robust when compared to its industry counterparts such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), which closed at $378.85, and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), which ended at $136.40. However, Oracle has yet to reclaim its June high of $127.54. Additionally, the company's trading volume has been notably lower than usual, trailing the 50-day average by more than 1 million shares.

Investors may be keeping a watchful eye on Oracle's performance as it navigates through the dynamic market conditions. While the company's recent stock movements have been relatively small, they are occurring within a broader context of market uncertainty where even minor changes can signal investor sentiment and broader economic trends.

InvestingPro Insights

In light of Oracle Corp.'s recent market activity, certain metrics from InvestingPro provide additional context for investors. Oracle's market capitalization stands at a substantial $318.34 billion, and the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 33.54, which adjusts to 31.25 for the last twelve months as of Q1 2024. This suggests a valuation that is high relative to near-term earnings growth, an InvestingPro Tip to consider for those evaluating the stock's current price.

Additionally, Oracle's revenue growth of 15.41% over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024 reflects a solid performance in the technology sector. Despite the stock's recent dip, Oracle's dividend yield is 1.38%, with a notable dividend growth of 25.0% over the last twelve months, indicating a commitment to returning value to shareholders—a factor that has been consistent, as Oracle has raised its dividend for 10 consecutive years.

By embracing a multi-stakeholder approach and fostering responsible AI development, we can ensure that AI's transformative potential continues to serve as a force for good in the world, said Michaela Browning, VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy, Google Asia Pacific.

""There is no silver bullet to combat deep fakes and AI-generated misinformation. It requires a collaborative effort, one that involves open communication, rigorous risk assessment, and proactive mitigation strategies,"" Browning added.

The company said it is pleased to have the opportunity to partner with the government and to continue dialogue, including through its upcoming engagement on the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) Summit.

""As we continue to incorporate AI, and more recently, generative AI, into more Google experiences, we know it's imperative to be bold and responsible together,"" said Browning.

The Centre last week gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent of such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

According to Google, it is looking to help address potential risks in multiple ways.

""One important consideration is helping users identify AI-generated content and empowering people with knowledge of when they're interacting with AI generated media,"" said the tech giant.

In the coming months, YouTube will require creators to disclose altered or synthetic content that is realistic, including using AI tools.

""We will inform viewers about such content through labels in the description panel and video player,"" said Google.

""In the coming months, on YouTube, we'll make it possible to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice, using our privacy request process,"" it added.

Google recently updated its election advertising policies to require advertisers to disclose when their election ads include material that's been digitally altered or generated. ""We also actively engage with policymakers, researchers, and experts to develop effective solutions. We have invested $1 million in grants to the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, to establish the first of its kind multidisciplinary center for Responsible AI,"" Browning noted.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., the parent company of Google, stands as a beacon of technological innovation and market leadership in the internet services and products sector. Analysts have recently provided a flurry of insights into the company's financial health, market position, and future prospects, painting a picture of a tech giant that is both confronting challenges and capturing new opportunities.

Company Performance and Market Trends

Alphabet has been making headlines with its financial performance, particularly in its core Search and YouTube segments, which continue to exceed market expectations. The company's Search revenue, excluding foreign exchange impacts, accelerated with an over 11% year-over-year increase, signaling a robust core business. Meanwhile, YouTube's advertising revenue outperformed, bolstered by growing engagement in Shorts and consistent viewership on connected TV screens.

Despite these strengths, the company faces headwinds in its Cloud services segment, where it has underperformed against competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure, leading to concerns about its market share and the need for further investment. Analysts have noted a deceleration in Cloud growth due to customer spend optimization, though engagement with AI offerings like Vertex (NASDAQ: ) AI is increasing.

Regulatory Environment and Legal Proceedings

Alphabet's operations are not without their regulatory challenges, with ongoing legal proceedings such as the Google v. DoJ trial presenting uncertainties. The trial's outcome could have significant implications for Alphabet's search unit economics and associated risks. However, the company's ""Overweight"" rating by several firms suggests a confidence in Alphabet's performance and potential growth, despite these risks.

Competitive Landscape

In the competitive cloud computing arena, Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is projected to hit $20 billion in GPU IaaS revenue by 2026, which could add a substantial boost to its revenue growth and gross profit. This positions GCP well to capture market share as AI IaaS demand increases, even though it currently holds a smaller market share compared to giants like AWS.

Strategic Investments and Innovations

Alphabet's strategic investments in Generative AI (GenAI) have been a focal point for analysts, with the company integrating GenAI across Google's services, including Search, YouTube, and GCP. These investments are expected to drive potential upside in 2024 revenue growth and profitability.

The company's advancements in AI-powered search and advertising are anticipated to strengthen its market position. Alphabet's focus on cost efficiencies and controlled hiring is projected to contribute to expanding margins and operational efficiency.

Financial Outlook

The company's earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and market capitalization reflect its financial stability and growth trajectory. Analysts have set price targets ranging from $140 to $200, indicating a belief in Alphabet's value appreciation potential.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Strong growth in Search revenue and YouTube advertising.

Strategic investments in GenAI across services.

Large total addressable markets for products and services.

InvestingPro Data indicates Alphabet's market capitalization stands at a colossal $1.71 trillion USD, underlining its massive presence in the market. Its Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, which is a measure of the company's current share price relative to its per-share earnings, is at 26.38, suggesting that investors are willing to pay a premium for its earnings potential. This is reinforced by the company's impressive Return on Assets (ROA) of 17.68% over the last twelve months as of Q3 2022, illustrating its efficiency in turning assets into profits.

Analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, which is an important consideration for investors.

InvestingPro Tips highlight that Alphabet operates with a high return on invested capital and assets, suggesting efficient management and a strong ability to generate profits from its investments. Additionally, the company does not pay a dividend, which could be a strategic decision to reinvest earnings back into the company for further growth.

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Marvell AI business to offset near-term 5G/enterprise weakness - JP Morgan,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/marvell-ai-business-to-offset-nearterm-5genterprise-weakness--jp-morgan-432SI-3914857,"Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 30th. Analysts, on average, are looking for EPS of $0.40 and revenue of $1.4 billion, down 30% and 9%, respectively, from last year. Analysts at JP Morgan see results in line with the consensus and expect ""flattish"" revenue guidance for the January quarter, which would be below the consensus, as stronger AI revenues are offset by weaker service provider/enterprise segments.

Marvell's market landscape shows varied trends, with some sectors like enterprise, 5G networking, and industrial facing gradual declines, analysts note. However, they anticipate a balancing effect due to the robust performance in its cloud networking division. This is propelled by substantial orders in the 800G PAM4 realm from significant players like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). For instance, Nvidia's networking arm has witnessed a staggering 2.8-fold growth in the last two quarters. Additionally, Marvell seems poised for an upward trajectory with the initiation of its initial custom AI ASIC program, which analysts speculate involves collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

While analysts expect weaker near-term 5G and enterprise spending trends, they believe CY24 revenue/EPS forecasts ""are still easily achievable."" This relates to the AI optical/ASIC revenue pipeline for CY24 coming in $300-$400 million higher than previously expected on the ""continued strong upside from PAM4 DSP (800G 1H, 1.6T ramp 2H) and ramp of the team’s first two AI ASIC programs in compute.""

""The team continues to drive 80%+ share in the PAM4 DSP optical chipset market and will benefit from the AI-driven demand for 800Gbps optical connectivity (2:1 ratio on PAM4 DSP chipsets : GPUs/TPUs) and the team is set to start to ramp its 1.6Tbps PAM4 DSP in the 2H to both NVIDIA and Google to support next-generation 3nm AI processor ramps,"" analysts commented.

Overall, JP Morgan reaffirmed an Overweight rating and a $70 price target for Marvell. Analysts perceive the current challenges faced in the 5G/enterprise domains as primarily cyclical or short-term in nature. Meanwhile, they see the company persisting in its execution of long-term growth strategies, poised to generate growth rates surpassing the industry in the mid- to longer-term horizon."

The penalty was imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position in the Play Store ecosystem.

On September 25, the NCLAT announced that it would commence the final hearing of the case. On January 11, the tribunal declined to provide immediate relief to Google against the CCI's order and scheduled the final hearing for April 2022.

Although Google appealed the NCLAT order in the Supreme Court, it later withdrew the case.

This is the second ongoing case against the tech giant by the CCI. In the first case, Google paid the entire penalty amount of Rs 1,337.76 crore imposed by CCI in the Android case. In October 2022, the CCI had penalised Google and directed it to desist from participating in anti-competitive practices and modify its conduct within a defined timeline.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

""Google Message to add some new animations for message reactions,"" AssembleDebug wrote.

""These are not your usual animated emoji reactions which you may have in Google Messages, this is something similar to message reactions in Telegram,"" he added.

2022-11-25, IANS,OpenAI fiasco triggers serious calls for guardrails around AI industry,https://in.investing.com/news/openai-fiasco-triggers-serious-calls-for-guardrails-around-ai-industry-3913314,"New Delhi, Nov 25 (IANS) The nail-biting drama around Sam Altman being sacked from OpenAI, joining Satya Nadella-run Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and then returning to OpenAI -- all within a span of six days -- has alerted governments and regulators and the call to apply guardrails on AI industry is now more vocal than ever.Couple of days before his ouster, Altman had said at a tech event that big regulatory changes weren’t needed for current AI models, but would be soon.

“We don’t need heavy regulation here or probably for the next couple generations. But at some point, when a model can do the equivalent output of a whole company, or a whole country, or a whole world, maybe we do want some collective supervision around that,” he said on a panel at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco.

However, the OpenAI fiasco has once again triggered the call to regulate AI in such a way that such episodes are not repeated.

France, Germany and Italy have reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated.

However, businesses and tech groups have cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models in upcoming AI rules.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI),” DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Ericsson (BS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

In India, concerns over deepfakes have put the government in motion to warn social media platforms to remove altered audio/video from their respective platforms or face action.

The government on Friday gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent against such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

""They are further mandated to remove such content within 24 hours upon receiving a report from either a user or government authority. Failure to comply with this requirement invokes Rule 7, which empowers aggrieved individuals to take platforms to court under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"" the minister said.

""For those who find themselves impacted by deepfakes, I strongly encourage you to file FIRs at your nearest police station,"" said Chandrasekhar, adding that the IT Ministry will help aggrieved users in filing FIRs in relation to deepfakes.

India is mulling regulation to tame the spread of deepfakes and other user harms that AI can bring along, said Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

After meeting representatives from large social media platforms and other stakeholders, the minister said India will draft new rules to spot and limit the spread of deepfakes. The new regulation will also strengthen the reporting process for such deepfake videos.

After the successful AI Safety Summit in the UK, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in Delhi next month will further deliberate upon the risks associated with AI -- in the presence of world leaders -- before a global framework is reached in Korea next year.

2022-11-24, Investing.com,"Investors are clamoring for OpenAI, Microsoft stock amid Sam Altman drama",https://in.investing.com/news/investors-are-clamoring-for-openai-microsoft-stock-amid-sam-altman-drama-432SI-3912798,"The recent dramatic firing and re-hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has led to a massive increase in would-be investors in the AI software company behind ChatGPT. An analysis from Venture Smarter showed that Google (NASDAQ: ) searches for ""OpenAI stock"" soared by 1,200% versus a 90-day high on November 18th, the day after Altman's firing was made public. On November 20th, searches soared again by 354% versus the prior last seven days after an employee revolt was reported.

There is some bad news and good news in this spike in investor interest in OpenAI stock.

First, the bad news. OpenAI is a private company and its stock is not available to be traded publicly on the stock market. At this point, only accredited investors can buy the stock from current private company shareholders when they are available on private stock exchanges like Forge. In late September, before the Altman hullabaloo, OpenAI was looking to sell shares for employees at a valuation of $80-$90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. It is unclear where the share sale stands currently amid the current controversy.

Onto the good news. Because most investors can't gain access to OpenAI stock currently, there is the next best thing - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). In January 2022, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI at a $29 billion valuation. They now own a 49% stake, which is potentially worth triple their prior investment. In fact, amid Altman's OpenAI firing, Microsoft planned to hire Altlman to could continue his AI work. Cooler heads prevailed and Microsoft is supportive of Altman's move back to OpenAI under a new board structure. Investor interest in Micososft's stock also soared, Venture Smarter noted. On the same day that Altman was fired, searches for ‘Buy Microsoft stock’ and ‘MSFT', shot up by 371% and 526%, respectively. In fact, on Wednesday, before the Thanksgiving break, Microsoft tapped a new all-time intra-day and closing high.

Commenting on what the news means for Microsoft, analysts at Mizuho said with or without Altman reporting directly to CEO Satya Nadella, the company stands to benefit the most from generative AI and they would expect the company's partnership with OpenAI to remain strong.

""For MSFT, we are not anticipating any significant changes regarding its governance or entitlements, although some change (to MSFT's benefit) is possible. And most importantly, we would very much expect MSFT's partnership with OpenAI to remain strong,"" the analysts commented.

""More broadly, notwithstanding a more difficult operating environment, we remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium-term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization,"" the analysts added. They rate the shares of Microsoft a Buy with a $420 price target and Top Pick designation."
2022-11-29, IANS,Collaborating with Indian govt to address deepfakes: Google,https://in.investing.com/news/collaborating-with-indian-govt-to-address-deepfakes-google-3917961,"New Delhi, Nov 29 (IANS) As the Indian government takes tough stand on AI-generated fake content especially deepfakes, Google (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday said the company's collaboration with the Indian government for a multi-stakeholder discussion aligns with its commitment to addressing this challenge together and ensuring a responsible approach to AI. By embracing a multi-stakeholder approach and fostering responsible AI development, we can ensure that AI's transformative potential continues to serve as a force for good in the world, said Michaela Browning, VP, Government Affairs & Public Policy, Google Asia Pacific.

""There is no silver bullet to combat deep fakes and AI-generated misinformation. It requires a collaborative effort, one that involves open communication, rigorous risk assessment, and proactive mitigation strategies,"" Browning added.

The company said it is pleased to have the opportunity to partner with the government and to continue dialogue, including through its upcoming engagement on the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) Summit.

""As we continue to incorporate AI, and more recently, generative AI, into more Google experiences, we know it's imperative to be bold and responsible together,"" said Browning.

The Centre last week gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent of such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

According to Google, it is looking to help address potential risks in multiple ways.

""One important consideration is helping users identify AI-generated content and empowering people with knowledge of when they're interacting with AI generated media,"" said the tech giant.

In the coming months, YouTube will require creators to disclose altered or synthetic content that is realistic, including using AI tools.

""We will inform viewers about such content through labels in the description panel and video player,"" said Google.

""In the coming months, on YouTube, we'll make it possible to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice, using our privacy request process,"" it added.

Google recently updated its election advertising policies to require advertisers to disclose when their election ads include material that's been digitally altered or generated. ""We also actively engage with policymakers, researchers, and experts to develop effective solutions. We have invested $1 million in grants to the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, to establish the first of its kind multidisciplinary center for Responsible AI,"" Browning noted.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., the parent company of Google, stands as a beacon of technological innovation and market leadership in the internet services and products sector. Analysts have recently provided a flurry of insights into the company's financial health, market position, and future prospects, painting a picture of a tech giant that is both confronting challenges and capturing new opportunities.

Company Performance and Market Trends

Alphabet has been making headlines with its financial performance, particularly in its core Search and YouTube segments, which continue to exceed market expectations. The company's Search revenue, excluding foreign exchange impacts, accelerated with an over 11% year-over-year increase, signaling a robust core business. Meanwhile, YouTube's advertising revenue outperformed, bolstered by growing engagement in Shorts and consistent viewership on connected TV screens.

Despite these strengths, the company faces headwinds in its Cloud services segment, where it has underperformed against competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Azure, leading to concerns about its market share and the need for further investment. Analysts have noted a deceleration in Cloud growth due to customer spend optimization, though engagement with AI offerings like Vertex (NASDAQ: ) AI is increasing.

Regulatory Environment and Legal Proceedings

Alphabet's operations are not without their regulatory challenges, with ongoing legal proceedings such as the Google v. DoJ trial presenting uncertainties. The trial's outcome could have significant implications for Alphabet's search unit economics and associated risks. However, the company's ""Overweight"" rating by several firms suggests a confidence in Alphabet's performance and potential growth, despite these risks.

Competitive Landscape

In the competitive cloud computing arena, Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is projected to hit $20 billion in GPU IaaS revenue by 2026, which could add a substantial boost to its revenue growth and gross profit. This positions GCP well to capture market share as AI IaaS demand increases, even though it currently holds a smaller market share compared to giants like AWS.

Strategic Investments and Innovations

Alphabet's strategic investments in Generative AI (GenAI) have been a focal point for analysts, with the company integrating GenAI across Google's services, including Search, YouTube, and GCP. These investments are expected to drive potential upside in 2024 revenue growth and profitability.

The company's advancements in AI-powered search and advertising are anticipated to strengthen its market position. Alphabet's focus on cost efficiencies and controlled hiring is projected to contribute to expanding margins and operational efficiency.

Financial Outlook

The company's earnings per share (EPS) forecasts and market capitalization reflect its financial stability and growth trajectory. Analysts have set price targets ranging from $140 to $200, indicating a belief in Alphabet's value appreciation potential.

SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

Strong growth in Search revenue and YouTube advertising.

Strategic investments in GenAI across services.

Large total addressable markets for products and services.

Weaknesses:

Underperformance in Cloud services compared to competitors.

Potential cost management issues indicated by missed margin targets.

Legal and regulatory challenges that could affect profitability.

Opportunities:

Expansion in the GPU IaaS market with GCP's projected growth.

Integration of AI improvements to capture transitioning ad spend to digital platforms.

2022-11-27, Investing.com,Marvell AI business to offset near-term 5G/enterprise weakness - JP Morgan,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/marvell-ai-business-to-offset-nearterm-5genterprise-weakness--jp-morgan-432SI-3914857,"Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 30th. Analysts, on average, are looking for EPS of $0.40 and revenue of $1.4 billion, down 30% and 9%, respectively, from last year. Analysts at JP Morgan see results in line with the consensus and expect ""flattish"" revenue guidance for the January quarter, which would be below the consensus, as stronger AI revenues are offset by weaker service provider/enterprise segments.

Marvell's market landscape shows varied trends, with some sectors like enterprise, 5G networking, and industrial facing gradual declines, analysts note. However, they anticipate a balancing effect due to the robust performance in its cloud networking division. This is propelled by substantial orders in the 800G PAM4 realm from significant players like Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ). For instance, Nvidia's networking arm has witnessed a staggering 2.8-fold growth in the last two quarters. Additionally, Marvell seems poised for an upward trajectory with the initiation of its initial custom AI ASIC program, which analysts speculate involves collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

While analysts expect weaker near-term 5G and enterprise spending trends, they believe CY24 revenue/EPS forecasts ""are still easily achievable."" This relates to the AI optical/ASIC revenue pipeline for CY24 coming in $300-$400 million higher than previously expected on the ""continued strong upside from PAM4 DSP (800G 1H, 1.6T ramp 2H) and ramp of the team’s first two AI ASIC programs in compute.""

""The team continues to drive 80%+ share in the PAM4 DSP optical chipset market and will benefit from the AI-driven demand for 800Gbps optical connectivity (2:1 ratio on PAM4 DSP chipsets : GPUs/TPUs) and the team is set to start to ramp its 1.6Tbps PAM4 DSP in the 2H to both NVIDIA and Google to support next-generation 3nm AI processor ramps,"" analysts commented.

Overall, JP Morgan reaffirmed an Overweight rating and a $70 price target for Marvell. Analysts perceive the current challenges faced in the 5G/enterprise domains as primarily cyclical or short-term in nature. Meanwhile, they see the company persisting in its execution of long-term growth strategies, poised to generate growth rates surpassing the industry in the mid- to longer-term horizon."

The penalty was imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position in the Play Store ecosystem.

On September 25, the NCLAT announced that it would commence the final hearing of the case. On January 11, the tribunal declined to provide immediate relief to Google against the CCI's order and scheduled the final hearing for April 2022.

Although Google appealed the NCLAT order in the Supreme Court, it later withdrew the case.

This is the second ongoing case against the tech giant by the CCI. In the first case, Google paid the entire penalty amount of Rs 1,337.76 crore imposed by CCI in the Android case. In October 2022, the CCI had penalised Google and directed it to desist from participating in anti-competitive practices and modify its conduct within a defined timeline.

2022-11-26, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3913688,"Investing.com -- With investors on tenterhooks over when global interest rates might start to fall, upcoming inflation data this week will be in focus. OPEC+ meets to discuss oil output cuts and data from China will give fresh insights on the economic outlook for the world’s number-two economy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

U.S. inflation data

On the heels of October's unchanged reading on consumer price inflation, markets will be hoping that another U.S. inflation report on Thursday will bolster the case for an end to Federal Reserve rate hikes .

The Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, is expected to have risen in November. The PCE index rose 0.4% in September, matching the rise in August.

The core reading, which strips out food and fuel costs and is considered a better gauge of underlying inflation, is expected to have risen on a year-over-year basis.

Other economic data out during the week includes a index for November on Tuesday - October's reading showed a third straight monthly decline. There will also be the first revision of third quarter , figures on for October, the weekly report on and the Fed’s .

Year-end rally?

Signs the U.S. stock market rally is broadening from the so-called Magnificent Seven of mega-cap growth and technology companies is bolstering investor hopes for a rally through year-end.

The Magnificent Seven group of stocks is made up of Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and they collectively hold a 28% weight in the . They make up nearly 50% of the weighting of the , which is up nearly 47% for the year to date.

Equities have risen sharply, with the broad S&P 500 advancing approximately 10% over the last three weeks, fuelled by falling Treasury yields and cooling inflation readings that could signal the end of Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investors will get further readings of inflation and consumer confidence (see above) during the week, but stronger-than-expected data could spur a selloff in Treasuries, sending yields higher.

OPEC+ meeting

Oil fell on Friday, but prices notched their first week of gains in over a month ahead of a meeting later this week to decide on production cuts in 2024.

futures settled down 1.4%, at $80.23 a barrel, while fell 2.5%, from Wednesday's close to $75.17. There was no settlement for WTI on Thursday owing to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

The gains for the week came as OPEC+ prepares for a meeting on Thursday that will have output cuts high on the agenda after recent oil price declines on demand concerns and burgeoning supply, particularly from non-OPEC producers.

The OPEC+ group, comprising of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, surprised the market last Wednesday by delaying its scheduled Nov. 26 meeting to Nov. 30 after producers struggled to reach a consensus on output levels.

Eurozone inflation

The Eurozone is to publish inflation data on Thursday that is expected to point to price pressures moderating again in November.

Consumer price inflation is expected to increase at an annual rate of , easing slightly from 2.9% the prior month. Underlying inflation is expected to slow to .

But despite indications that inflation is cooling, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has warned that borrowing costs will need to stay restrictive for longer.

Last Thursday, the minutes of the ECB’s latest policy meeting indicated that officials agree they should be ready to hike again if needed.

Inflation is only forecast to return to the ECB’s target of 2% in the second half of 2025.

China outlook

China is to release official purchasing manager indexes for November on Thursday, with investors on the lookout for any signs of a recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

In October data showed that fell back into contraction despite a raft of government measures aimed at shoring up the faltering economy, which has been hit by weak consumption and a crisis in the country's debt-laden property sector, which comprises around a quarter of gross domestic product.

China's economy grew at a faster-than-expected 4.9% in the third quarter, But Beijing still faces an uphill battle to achieve its annual growth target of around 5%.

""Google Message to add some new animations for message reactions,"" AssembleDebug wrote.

""These are not your usual animated emoji reactions which you may have in Google Messages, this is something similar to message reactions in Telegram,"" he added.

2022-11-25, IANS,OpenAI fiasco triggers serious calls for guardrails around AI industry,https://in.investing.com/news/openai-fiasco-triggers-serious-calls-for-guardrails-around-ai-industry-3913314,"New Delhi, Nov 25 (IANS) The nail-biting drama around Sam Altman being sacked from OpenAI, joining Satya Nadella-run Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and then returning to OpenAI -- all within a span of six days -- has alerted governments and regulators and the call to apply guardrails on AI industry is now more vocal than ever.Couple of days before his ouster, Altman had said at a tech event that big regulatory changes weren’t needed for current AI models, but would be soon.

“We don’t need heavy regulation here or probably for the next couple generations. But at some point, when a model can do the equivalent output of a whole company, or a whole country, or a whole world, maybe we do want some collective supervision around that,” he said on a panel at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco.

However, the OpenAI fiasco has once again triggered the call to regulate AI in such a way that such episodes are not repeated.

France, Germany and Italy have reached an agreement on how AI should be regulated.

However, businesses and tech groups have cautioned the European Union against excessive regulation of foundation models in upcoming AI rules.

""For Europe to become a global digital powerhouse, we need companies that can lead on AI innovation also using foundation models and the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI),” DigitalEurope, whose members include Airbus, Apple (NASDAQ: ), Ericsson (BS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), LSE and SAP, wrote in a letter.

In India, concerns over deepfakes have put the government in motion to warn social media platforms to remove altered audio/video from their respective platforms or face action.

The government on Friday gave a seven-day deadline to social media platforms to tweak their policies as per Indian regulations in order to address the spread of deepfakes on their platforms.

Deepfakes could be subject to action under the current IT Rules, particularly Rule 3(1)(b), which mandates the removal of 12 types of content within 24 hours of receiving user complaints, said Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

The government will also take action of 100 per cent against such violations under the IT Rules in the future.

""They are further mandated to remove such content within 24 hours upon receiving a report from either a user or government authority. Failure to comply with this requirement invokes Rule 7, which empowers aggrieved individuals to take platforms to court under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),"" the minister said.

""For those who find themselves impacted by deepfakes, I strongly encourage you to file FIRs at your nearest police station,"" said Chandrasekhar, adding that the IT Ministry will help aggrieved users in filing FIRs in relation to deepfakes.

India is mulling regulation to tame the spread of deepfakes and other user harms that AI can bring along, said Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.

After meeting representatives from large social media platforms and other stakeholders, the minister said India will draft new rules to spot and limit the spread of deepfakes. The new regulation will also strengthen the reporting process for such deepfake videos.

After the successful AI Safety Summit in the UK, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) in Delhi next month will further deliberate upon the risks associated with AI -- in the presence of world leaders -- before a global framework is reached in Korea next year.

2022-11-24, Investing.com,"Investors are clamoring for OpenAI, Microsoft stock amid Sam Altman drama",https://in.investing.com/news/investors-are-clamoring-for-openai-microsoft-stock-amid-sam-altman-drama-432SI-3912798,"The recent dramatic firing and re-hiring of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has led to a massive increase in would-be investors in the AI software company behind ChatGPT. An analysis from Venture Smarter showed that Google (NASDAQ: ) searches for ""OpenAI stock"" soared by 1,200% versus a 90-day high on November 18th, the day after Altman's firing was made public. On November 20th, searches soared again by 354% versus the prior last seven days after an employee revolt was reported.

There is some bad news and good news in this spike in investor interest in OpenAI stock.

First, the bad news. OpenAI is a private company and its stock is not available to be traded publicly on the stock market. At this point, only accredited investors can buy the stock from current private company shareholders when they are available on private stock exchanges like Forge. In late September, before the Altman hullabaloo, OpenAI was looking to sell shares for employees at a valuation of $80-$90 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. It is unclear where the share sale stands currently amid the current controversy.

Onto the good news. Because most investors can't gain access to OpenAI stock currently, there is the next best thing - Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). In January 2022, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI at a $29 billion valuation. They now own a 49% stake, which is potentially worth triple their prior investment. In fact, amid Altman's OpenAI firing, Microsoft planned to hire Altlman to could continue his AI work. Cooler heads prevailed and Microsoft is supportive of Altman's move back to OpenAI under a new board structure. Investor interest in Micososft's stock also soared, Venture Smarter noted. On the same day that Altman was fired, searches for ‘Buy Microsoft stock’ and ‘MSFT', shot up by 371% and 526%, respectively. In fact, on Wednesday, before the Thanksgiving break, Microsoft tapped a new all-time intra-day and closing high.

Commenting on what the news means for Microsoft, analysts at Mizuho said with or without Altman reporting directly to CEO Satya Nadella, the company stands to benefit the most from generative AI and they would expect the company's partnership with OpenAI to remain strong.

""For MSFT, we are not anticipating any significant changes regarding its governance or entitlements, although some change (to MSFT's benefit) is possible. And most importantly, we would very much expect MSFT's partnership with OpenAI to remain strong,"" the analysts commented.

""More broadly, notwithstanding a more difficult operating environment, we remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium-term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization,"" the analysts added. They rate the shares of Microsoft a Buy with a $420 price target and Top Pick designation."
2022-11-23, Investing.com,Google Pay introduces convenience fees for UPI transactions in India,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pay-introduces-convenience-fees-for-upi-transactions-in-india-93CH-3911572,"Digital payment platforms in India are increasingly looking to monetize their services, and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay is the latest to join this trend. As part of its new revenue strategy, Google Pay has started imposing convenience fees on mobile recharges via its Unified Payments Interface (NASDAQ: ) (UPI) service. This change was not announced formally but was detected by users and later confirmed through updates to the service's Terms of Service.

The fee structure is designed to be incremental, with no charges for recharges up to ₹100. A fee of ₹1 is levied for amounts between ₹101 to ₹200, ₹2 for ₹201 to ₹300, and a fixed cap of ₹3 for any amount beyond that. This tiered approach aims to maintain user-friendliness and ensure business sustainability. The new fee policy came into effect following a quiet update to the Terms of Service on November 10, 2022.

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) statistics as of October 2022 show that Google Pay holds a significant portion of the UPI market at 36%, trailing behind PhonePe at 46%, with Paytm (NS: ) holding around 13%. The dominance of these platforms in the UPI market by both volume and value was also highlighted in a report by the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) for the financial year ending March 2022.

This move by Google Pay reflects a broader industry-wide shift where various online services have begun charging fees for additional conveniences like food delivery and movie ticket bookings. The selective application of fees by Google Pay indicates a careful approach to monetization, likely aimed at gauging customer response before implementing widespread changes across its platform.

2022-11-23, IANS,Google Maps suggestion left travellers stranded in desert for hours,https://in.investing.com/news/google-maps-suggestion-left-travellers-stranded-in-desert-for-hours-3911418,"New Delhi, Nov 23 (IANS) A group of travellers in the US was left stranded in the desert for hours after allegedly taking a shortcut suggested by Google (NASDAQ: ) Maps.To avoid traffic, the travellers group from California allegedly took Google Maps' suggestion when they were returning to Los Angeles from Las Vegas on November 19, reports SFGate. While driving back to Los Angeles from a Formula 1 race in Las Vegas, Shelby Easler, her brother Austin, and their partners followed suggestions by Google Maps to avoid the major highway connecting the two cities.

The app suggested the group to take an alternate route to avoid the dust storm that caused major traffic delays on the Interstate 15 highway.

However, the route took the group into Nevada’s deserts, according to the report.

“We ironically thought it would be a safer option, and it did say it would be 50 minutes faster. It was our first time driving to/from Vegas, so we didn’t know that you can really only take the I-15 back and forth,” Easler was quoted as saying.

Easler and her family were not the only ones who were unaware of this. Her TikTok video showed a trail of cars stuck on the same road.

“The first driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get, and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,” Easler said.

The group felt 'trapped' so they called 911 for the rescue, but the California Highway Patrol could not help as it was dealing with a dust storm emergency.

They then contacted a towing company that sent trucks and rescued Easler's car as well as the other stranded vehicles.

Easler said, “In the future, I'll stick to the road I know and double-check somewhere else if the route seems sketchy”.

The evidentiary portion of the Google vs DOJ legal battle has concluded and, Evercore said that while much of the evidence and testimony was behind closed doors, ""there were some interesting details disclosed during the public part of the trial.""

During the trial, It was disclosed that Google paid $26.3B to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others for default search placement in 2021. Evercore thinks ""the majority of this went to Apple.""

""We now estimate that Apple earns $18-20B from the Google relationship vs our prior estimate of $12-15B,"" the analysts stated. The firm also noted that it was disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from Safari search traffic.

The next step for the case will be closing arguments, which are scheduled for May 1 to 3, 2024. After that, the judge will issue a ruling.

If Google is found to have violated antitrust law, then the potential penalties could range from ordering greater transparency in the negotiating process to a break up of Google (very unlikely), explained the analysts at Evercore.

""The potential punishment that would have the greatest impact on Apple would be for the judge to forbid the payment for default search placement arrangement. Assuming Apple earns $19B/year from the Google deal, this would imply ~17% of Apple's net income is at risk if the judge rules the deal is anti-competitive behavior,"" they added.

Analysts at Evercore estimate it will likely be nine to 12 months before there is a ruling from the judge, which would be followed by a second trial and a lengthy appeals process, so it could be multiple years before this case is fully settled.

Even so, the firm continues to think Google has a stronger case."

The investment, routed through Alphabet's growth fund Capital G, is expected to surge over £300 million, potentially lifting Monzo's market value to a staggering £4 billion.

Monzo has made headlines since its 2015 launch for its modern approach to banking and has amassed a robust customer base of 8.5 million users. Despite facing challenges such as heavy losses and stringent regulatory hurdles in the years following 2020, Monzo has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Today, it stands as the seventh largest bank in the UK and is on the brink of achieving profitability.

This latest round of funding signifies more than just a capital increase; it marks a milestone for Monzo's global ambitions and its path to an initial public offering (IPO). Alphabet's investment is not only a testament to Monzo's potential but also aligns with strategic executive decisions aimed at propelling the company towards market expansion and IPO readiness.

Previously, in December 2021, Monzo successfully secured over £377 million in a Series H funding round. The round featured key investors such as the Abu Dhabi Growth Fund and received backing from firms like Accel. This demonstrated investor confidence in Monzo's business model and future prospects.

With Alphabet's upcoming investment through Capital G by year-end, Monzo is positioning itself as a leader in UK Open Banking. The company has already been through more than 20 funding rounds with participation from 38 investors, including prominent names such as Tencent and Kaiser Permanente Ventures.

Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) substantial financial commitment could be the decisive factor that propels Monzo into the public markets, marking a new chapter for the digital bank. This move underscores the growing interest from established tech entities in innovative financial startups that are reshaping the banking landscape.

Sweeney said Google tried to entice him with a wide range of financial incentives, which he rejected, reports CBS News.

""It seemed like a crooked arrangement. Google was proposing a series of side deals, which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them,” Sweeney told the jury.

“I want everybody to see and understand Google exercises de facto control over the availability of apps on Android,” he added.

Sweeney's testimony came less than a week after Google CEO Sundar Pichai defended its Play Store for Android apps. It's one of two antitrust cases against Google.

After rejecting Google's offers, Epic tried to distribute the Fortnite game for Android through its own website.

However, Sweeney testified that effort quickly turned into ""a depressing process"" because far fewer game players downloaded Fortnite for Android phones than anticipated.

""We realised Google was a difficult adversary and had the ability to obstruct us,"" Sweeney was quoted as saying.

Epic eventually released Fortnite in the Play Store in 2020.

The alternative payment option was released in August 2020 in revised Fortnite apps for both the Play Store and the iPhone app store, prompting both Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google to block it within a few hours.

""It's an issue I see as existential to all games, including Epic,"" Sweeney said.

Epic Games has been the sole plaintiff in the courtroom daily since the trial began two weeks ago, following settlements between Google, Match Group (NASDAQ: ), and several state attorneys general. The jury is expected to reach a decision next month on whether Google has indeed violated antitrust laws.

During his testimony, Sweeney highlighted that Google's imposed fees have significantly impeded Epic's potential for growth. He pointed out that despite generating $12 billion in revenue from console platforms, Epic Games currently faces losses. Moreover, Sweeney shared insights into Epic's pricing strategies, acknowledging that they have been able to reduce costs by avoiding platform fees on PC distributions. He also mentioned having pricing agreements with Sony (NYSE: ) that differ from their uniform pricing strategy.

The outcome of this case will be closely watched as it may set a precedent for how tech giants like Google manage their app marketplaces and could potentially reshape the digital economy's competitive landscape. The jury's decision next month will conclude this critical examination of Google's business practices in relation to antitrust laws.

The exhibit leverages technology, such as Google’s Augmented Reality and Street View to offer an immersive experience across over 120 expert-curated stories and over 7,000 assets, including about 5,000 hi-res images and over 1,500 videos, posters and songs related to films spanning early classics such as, “Manthan,” to modern blockbusters.

2022-11-23, Investing.com,Google Pay introduces convenience fees for UPI transactions in India,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pay-introduces-convenience-fees-for-upi-transactions-in-india-93CH-3911572,"Digital payment platforms in India are increasingly looking to monetize their services, and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay is the latest to join this trend. As part of its new revenue strategy, Google Pay has started imposing convenience fees on mobile recharges via its Unified Payments Interface (NASDAQ: ) (UPI) service. This change was not announced formally but was detected by users and later confirmed through updates to the service's Terms of Service.

The fee structure is designed to be incremental, with no charges for recharges up to ₹100. A fee of ₹1 is levied for amounts between ₹101 to ₹200, ₹2 for ₹201 to ₹300, and a fixed cap of ₹3 for any amount beyond that. This tiered approach aims to maintain user-friendliness and ensure business sustainability. The new fee policy came into effect following a quiet update to the Terms of Service on November 10, 2022.

The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) statistics as of October 2022 show that Google Pay holds a significant portion of the UPI market at 36%, trailing behind PhonePe at 46%, with Paytm (NS: ) holding around 13%. The dominance of these platforms in the UPI market by both volume and value was also highlighted in a report by the Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL) for the financial year ending March 2022.

This move by Google Pay reflects a broader industry-wide shift where various online services have begun charging fees for additional conveniences like food delivery and movie ticket bookings. The selective application of fees by Google Pay indicates a careful approach to monetization, likely aimed at gauging customer response before implementing widespread changes across its platform.

2022-11-23, IANS,Google Maps suggestion left travellers stranded in desert for hours,https://in.investing.com/news/google-maps-suggestion-left-travellers-stranded-in-desert-for-hours-3911418,"New Delhi, Nov 23 (IANS) A group of travellers in the US was left stranded in the desert for hours after allegedly taking a shortcut suggested by Google (NASDAQ: ) Maps.To avoid traffic, the travellers group from California allegedly took Google Maps' suggestion when they were returning to Los Angeles from Las Vegas on November 19, reports SFGate. While driving back to Los Angeles from a Formula 1 race in Las Vegas, Shelby Easler, her brother Austin, and their partners followed suggestions by Google Maps to avoid the major highway connecting the two cities.

The app suggested the group to take an alternate route to avoid the dust storm that caused major traffic delays on the Interstate 15 highway.

However, the route took the group into Nevada’s deserts, according to the report.

“We ironically thought it would be a safer option, and it did say it would be 50 minutes faster. It was our first time driving to/from Vegas, so we didn’t know that you can really only take the I-15 back and forth,” Easler was quoted as saying.

Easler and her family were not the only ones who were unaware of this. Her TikTok video showed a trail of cars stuck on the same road.

“The first driver that turned around talked to us to tell us that the road gets washed out the higher into the mountain you get, and we have to turn around since the path leads nowhere. He was in a huge truck and was just driving straight through the bushes and shrubs to let people know to turn around,” Easler said.

The group felt 'trapped' so they called 911 for the rescue, but the California Highway Patrol could not help as it was dealing with a dust storm emergency.

They then contacted a towing company that sent trucks and rescued Easler's car as well as the other stranded vehicles.

Easler said, “In the future, I'll stick to the road I know and double-check somewhere else if the route seems sketchy”.

""We're taking the first steps in Bard's ability to understand YouTube videos,"" Google wrote on Bard's update page.

""For example, if you’re looking for videos on how to make olive oil cake, you can now also ask how many eggs the recipe in the first video requires,"" it explained.

The company said it expanded ""the YouTube Extension to understand some video content so you can have a richer conversation with Bard about it"".

Prior to this latest update, the YouTube Extension for Bard could only be used to find specific videos.

The new update comes just two weeks after YouTube began experimenting with new generative AI capabilities, such as an AI conversational tool that answers queries about YouTube's content and a new feature that summarises topics in a video's comments.

Meanwhile, Google has announced to make Bard available for teens in most countries with some guardrails in place.

""Teens in those countries who meet the minimum age requirement to manage their own Google Account will be able to access Bard in English, with more languages to come over time,"" said Tulsee Doshi, Head of Product, Responsible AI at Google.

Before launching to teens, the tech giant consulted with child safety and development experts to help shape its content policies and an experience that prioritises safety.

The evidentiary portion of the Google vs DOJ legal battle has concluded and, Evercore said that while much of the evidence and testimony was behind closed doors, ""there were some interesting details disclosed during the public part of the trial.""

During the trial, It was disclosed that Google paid $26.3B to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and others for default search placement in 2021. Evercore thinks ""the majority of this went to Apple.""

""We now estimate that Apple earns $18-20B from the Google relationship vs our prior estimate of $12-15B,"" the analysts stated. The firm also noted that it was disclosed that Google pays Apple 36% of the revenue it earns from Safari search traffic.

The next step for the case will be closing arguments, which are scheduled for May 1 to 3, 2024. After that, the judge will issue a ruling.

If Google is found to have violated antitrust law, then the potential penalties could range from ordering greater transparency in the negotiating process to a break up of Google (very unlikely), explained the analysts at Evercore.

""The potential punishment that would have the greatest impact on Apple would be for the judge to forbid the payment for default search placement arrangement. Assuming Apple earns $19B/year from the Google deal, this would imply ~17% of Apple's net income is at risk if the judge rules the deal is anti-competitive behavior,"" they added.

Analysts at Evercore estimate it will likely be nine to 12 months before there is a ruling from the judge, which would be followed by a second trial and a lengthy appeals process, so it could be multiple years before this case is fully settled.

Even so, the firm continues to think Google has a stronger case."

The investment, routed through Alphabet's growth fund Capital G, is expected to surge over £300 million, potentially lifting Monzo's market value to a staggering £4 billion.

Monzo has made headlines since its 2015 launch for its modern approach to banking and has amassed a robust customer base of 8.5 million users. Despite facing challenges such as heavy losses and stringent regulatory hurdles in the years following 2020, Monzo has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Today, it stands as the seventh largest bank in the UK and is on the brink of achieving profitability.

This latest round of funding signifies more than just a capital increase; it marks a milestone for Monzo's global ambitions and its path to an initial public offering (IPO). Alphabet's investment is not only a testament to Monzo's potential but also aligns with strategic executive decisions aimed at propelling the company towards market expansion and IPO readiness.

Previously, in December 2021, Monzo successfully secured over £377 million in a Series H funding round. The round featured key investors such as the Abu Dhabi Growth Fund and received backing from firms like Accel. This demonstrated investor confidence in Monzo's business model and future prospects.

With Alphabet's upcoming investment through Capital G by year-end, Monzo is positioning itself as a leader in UK Open Banking. The company has already been through more than 20 funding rounds with participation from 38 investors, including prominent names such as Tencent and Kaiser Permanente Ventures.

Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) substantial financial commitment could be the decisive factor that propels Monzo into the public markets, marking a new chapter for the digital bank. This move underscores the growing interest from established tech entities in innovative financial startups that are reshaping the banking landscape.

Sweeney said Google tried to entice him with a wide range of financial incentives, which he rejected, reports CBS News.

""It seemed like a crooked arrangement. Google was proposing a series of side deals, which seemed designed to convince Epic not to compete against them,” Sweeney told the jury.

“I want everybody to see and understand Google exercises de facto control over the availability of apps on Android,” he added.

Sweeney's testimony came less than a week after Google CEO Sundar Pichai defended its Play Store for Android apps. It's one of two antitrust cases against Google.

After rejecting Google's offers, Epic tried to distribute the Fortnite game for Android through its own website.

However, Sweeney testified that effort quickly turned into ""a depressing process"" because far fewer game players downloaded Fortnite for Android phones than anticipated.

""We realised Google was a difficult adversary and had the ability to obstruct us,"" Sweeney was quoted as saying.

Epic eventually released Fortnite in the Play Store in 2020.

The alternative payment option was released in August 2020 in revised Fortnite apps for both the Play Store and the iPhone app store, prompting both Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google to block it within a few hours.

""It's an issue I see as existential to all games, including Epic,"" Sweeney said.

Sweeney also said he would have taken Sony to court over PlayStation cross-play.

“We were willing to fight them in court if necessary,” he said.

Initiating coverage, they assigned an Overweight rating to the company with a $70 price target. This optimistic stance is based on expectations of substantial top-line growth in fiscal year 2024, predicted at around 13%. The company's shares responded positively to the news, ticking up by 0.8%.

Arm has been in the spotlight since its initial public offering on September 14, 2022, marking its transition into the public markets. The company has since reported earnings that exceeded quarterly expectations and projected third-quarter revenues to land between $720 million and $800 million. Although this forecast falls slightly below the anticipated $776 million, Arm continues to draw strength from high-profile clients such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

Despite mixed reactions to near-term revenue projections earlier in November, analysts from BofA Securities have maintained a Buy rating on Arm. The analysts' confidence in the company stems from its potential to outpace competitors over the next three years through market share expansion and increased royalty rates.

Arm's CFO Jason Child also contributed to the positive outlook, hinting at ""pretty significant growth"" driven by sizeable license agreements expected in the fourth quarter. The company's robust licensing prospects and strong market positioning reinforce analyst confidence in its growth trajectory.

""I literally was trapped by addiction at age 12. And I did not get my life back for all of my teenage years,” Taylor Little, now 21, was quoted as saying in the report that came out on Monday.

Taylor's social media addiction led to suicide attempts and years of depression.

""If I had my phone taken away, it felt like having withdrawals. It was unbearable. Literally, when I say it was addictive, I don't mean it was habit-forming. I mean, my body and mind craved that,” she was quoted as saying.

Taylor also struggled with content around body image and eating disorders.

Taylor and hundreds of other American families are suing four of the biggest tech companies -- Meta (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Snap Inc (NYSE: ) (parent of Snapchat).

“Lawyers for the families believe the case of 14-year-old British schoolgirl Molly Russell is an important example of the potential harms faced by teenagers,” the BBC report noted.

Russell, a seemingly happy teenager from northwest London, was found dead in her bedroom in November 2017.

It later emerged she had viewed masses of content related to suicide, depression and anxiety online.

Russell's name is mentioned a dozen times in the master complaint submitted to the court in California.

In a breather for these families, a federal court in the US last week rejected social media giants’ motion to dismiss dozens of lawsuits, accusing them of running platforms ""addictive"" to kids and allegedly spreading child sex abuse materials.

US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected their motion, saying that Meta, ByteDance, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) must proceed with a lawsuit alleging their social platforms have adverse mental health effects on children.

""Because children still developing impulse control are uniquely susceptible to harms arising out of compulsive use of social media platforms, defendants have 'created a youth mental health crisis' through the defective design of their platforms,"" according to the ruling.

""Further, these platforms facilitate and contribute to the sexual exploitation and sextortion of children, as well as the ongoing production and spread of child sex abuse materials (CSAM) online. To that end, defendants know that children use their products, both from public and internal data,"" the ruling read.

Lawyers for the families called it a ""significant victory"".

In a statement, Meta said that their thoughts are with the families represented in these complaints.

""We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we are doing to provide teens with safe, supportive experiences online,” the social media giant said.

Google said that the allegations in these complaints are “simply not true”.

“Protecting kids across our platforms has always been core to our work,” the company said.

Snapchat said its platform ""was designed to remove the pressure to be perfect. We vet all content before it can reach a large audience to prevent the spread of anything that could be harmful.""

2022-11-18, Investing.com,Nvidia maintains lead in AI market as AMD faces challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-maintains-lead-in-ai-market-as-amd-faces-challenges-93CH-3905300,"NEW YORK - As the artificial intelligence (AI) sector grows, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is grappling with the challenge of catching up to Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s lead, primarily due to Nvidia's comprehensive hardware-software ecosystem. Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 31%, while AMD reported an 8% decline in gaming revenues. The success of Nvidia is partly attributed to its CUDA software, which has become a standard in AI development.

Despite these challenges, AMD has seen a surge in sales for its AMD 7000 series laptop chips, with an increase of 41%. This growth comes amidst a broader effort by cloud industry leaders, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), to develop their own proprietary AI chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia. Yet, these companies continue to invest in Nvidia's products due to its established ecosystem.

Nvidia's strategy of expanding into cloud services aims to reinforce its market position. The company's financial health is robust, with profit margins nearing 25%, significantly outpacing AMD's 4%. This stark contrast in profitability underlines why Nvidia may continue to be a more attractive investment option compared to AMD. Despite projections hinting at AMD's faster growth in 2024, Nvidia is expected to hold onto its leadership position.

Tech giants and investors are closely watching these developments. who holds positions in both AMD and Nvidia as well as other tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel (NASDAQ: ), considers his investment in AMD as a strategic hedge against his larger stake in Nvidia. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) has opted not to challenge Nvidia's GPU capabilities for AI tasks, further cementing Nvidia's dominance in the market.

As the AI revolution demands more processing power, both companies are likely to remain critical players. However, for now, Nvidia's combined hardware-software offerings give it an edge reminiscent of Intel’s past market dominance but with the added leverage of being a crucial software provider akin to Microsoft. In contrast, AMD continues to navigate the market as a secondary supplier.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Gap's holiday season outlook, Alibaba slips in Hong Kong - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaps-holiday-season-outlook-alibaba-slips-in-hong-kong--whats-moving-markets-3904586,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point into the green following a mixed session on Wall Street, as traders pour through a raft of economic figures this week. Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."
2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Apple to support RCS messaging, boosting Android interoperability",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-support-rcs-messaging-boosting-android-interoperability-93CH-3904322,"CUPERTINO - In a strategic pivot, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced its plan to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) Universal Profile, a messaging standard widely used by Android devices, including those from tech rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (KS: ). This move marks a significant shift from Apple's previous stance on messaging interoperability and comes as the company faces regulatory pressure from the European Union's Digital Markets Act.

The integration of RCS into iPhones, starting with the iPhone 15 series, is expected to enhance user experience by improving cross-platform messaging capabilities. RCS is set to replace traditional SMS and MMS services, offering a richer communication experience akin to Apple's own iMessage platform. While iMessage is known for its robust privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, RCS does not currently offer the same level of security. Nevertheless, Apple is committed to maintaining user privacy and continues to promote iMessage as its premier messaging service due to its superior security measures.

The announcement on Thursday aligns with the appeal deadline for the EU's Digital Markets Act, which mandates service interoperability among large technology firms. In 2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook dismissed the idea of adopting cross-platform RCS, advocating instead for consumers to purchase iPhones to enjoy exclusive iMessage features. However, this policy change indicates a more collaborative approach to messaging standards and could potentially reshape how iPhone users communicate with Android users.

By supporting RCS Universal Profile, Apple is taking steps toward creating a more unified messaging ecosystem that transcends device boundaries while attempting to uphold its commitment to user privacy and security.

Despite the broader market's mixed signals, Sirius XM's lower trading volume suggests less investor engagement with the stock on Thursday. The reasons behind the reduced interest and the dip in Sirius XM's stock value were not immediately clear, leaving market watchers to ponder whether this represents a temporary setback or indicates a more sustained trend for the company.

“At this initial phase, the experiment is designed to help explore how the technology could be used to create deeper connections between artists and creators, and ultimately, their fans,” said Lyor Cohen, global head of music at YouTube.

Nine artists including Alec Benjamin, Charlie Puth, Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, John Legend, Papoose, Sia, T-Pain, and Troye Sivan have chosen to collaborate in this experiment and work with YouTube to shape the future of AI in musi.

“They are giving a small group of select US creators the chance to create unique soundtracks of up to 30 seconds for their Shorts,” Cohen added.

Responding to a user on 'X', the minister said that search bias, algorithmic bias and AI models with bias are real violations of the safety and trust obligations placed on platforms under Rule 3(1)(b) of IT rules under regulatory framework in India.

""Those who are aggrieved by this can file FIRs against such platforms and safe harbor/immunity under Sec 79 will not apply to these cases,"" he told the X user.

The safe harbour provision gives social media platforms legal immunity against content shared by users on their respective platforms.

The government intends to remove such provisions in the Digital India Bill.

The X user posted screenshots of a conversation with Google (NASDAQ: ) Bard where he asked the platform to summarise an article by a news website but Bard responded, saying it cannot summarise the article as the platform allegedly spreads false information and is biased.

Last month, the Ministry of Electronics and IT issued notices to social media intermediaries X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and Telegram, warning them to remove any kind of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) from their platforms on the Indian internet or face action.

""The government is determined to build a safe and trusted internet under the IT rules. The rules under the IT Act lay down strict expectations from social media intermediaries that they should not allow criminal or harmful posts on their platforms. If they do not act swiftly, their safe harbour under section 79 of the IT Act would be withdrawn and consequences under the Indian law will follow,"" the minister had warned.

Google-owned YouTube had said it did not detect any kind of CSAM on its platform. Encrypted messaging platform Telegram said it is ""always committed"" to upholding legal and ethical standards on its platform.

“Teens in those countries who meet the minimum age requirement to manage their own Google Account will be able to access Bard in English, with more languages to come over time,” said Doshi.

Before launching to teens, the tech giant consulted with child safety and development experts to help shape its content policies and an experience that prioritises safety.

“Organisations like the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) advised us on how to keep the needs of teens and families in mind,” Doshi added.

Teens can use Bard to find inspiration, discover new hobbies and solve everyday problems. Bard can also be a helpful learning tool for teens, allowing them to dig deeper into topics, better understand complex concepts and practice new skills in ways that work best for them.

“For even more interactive learning, we’re bringing a math learning experience into Bard. Anyone, including teens, can simply type or upload a picture of a math equation, and Bard won’t just give the answer — it’ll share step-by-step explanations of how to solve it,” said Doshi.

Bard will be able to help with data visualisation, too.

""FOSI's research found that most teens and parents expect that GenAI skills will be an important part of their future,” according to Stephen Balkam, Founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.

Teens also shared feedback with Google directly that they have questions about how to use generative AI and what its limitations might be.

“We’ve trained Bard to recognise areas that are inappropriate to younger users and implemented safety features and guardrails to help prevent unsafe content, such as illegal or age-gated substances, from appearing in its responses to teens,” said the company.

“We also recognise that many people, including teens, are not always aware of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs),” Doshi noted.

LLMs are prone to “hallucinating,” which means that they can generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical.

“So the first time a teen asks a fact-based question, we’ll automatically run our double-check response feature, which helps evaluate whether there’s content across the web to substantiate Bard’s response,” the company said.

This dip positioned the company's shares just below its 52-week high of $338.10, achieved the day before. On a day where trading activity for Meta was subdued with only 14.4 million shares changing hands, the tech firm trailed behind industry peers such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., which all enjoyed share price increases during the same session.

Meta's lower-than-average trading volume suggests less investor activity than usual for the company's stock. The 50-day average volume typically provides a benchmark for the stock’s regular trading activity, and Tuesday's figures fell short of this mark.

The decline in Meta's share value contrasts with its recent strong performance that had propelled the stock near its yearly peak. It remains to be seen if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more sustained shift in investor sentiment towards the company.

Microsoft has taken an early lead in this race with its strategic investment in OpenAI, which has borne fruit in the form of Copilot, an AI-powered tool integrated into Microsoft 365 suite.

Copilot has been making waves by boosting productivity for businesses, leveraging the capabilities of AI to streamline tasks and improve efficiency. This tool is part of Microsoft's broader push to incorporate AI into its widely-used office software, potentially transforming how professionals interact with applications like Word, Excel, and Outlook.

On the other side of this competitive landscape, Alphabet is not standing still. The company is preparing to launch Google Duet, an initiative that aims to capitalize on its already strong assets such as Google Search and YouTube. Google Duet is expected to enhance these platforms by embedding more sophisticated AI functionalities into them.

Despite Microsoft's current edge and the impressive milestone of ChatGPT reaching 100 million weekly active users, Alphabet's forthcoming projects could shift the balance. The company is working on Bard and Gemini, two projects that have the potential to outshine their rivals in the long term. Bard, which is already in the conversation, along with the anticipated Gemini, could offer superior chatbot capabilities that would not only improve user experience but also significantly impact how users interact with Google's search engine and YouTube.

An attorney for Epic asked Pichai if the detail presented by Google’s witness was accurate.

“That’s correct,” Pichai responded.

About the Samsung (KS: ) deal, Pichai told the court that “it’s like apples and oranges”.

The Google CEO added that the deals sometimes pay carriers.

He later said that Google competes “fiercely with Apple.”

“The attorney for Epic also asked Pichai about the exact dollar amount it pays to Apple, to which Pichai said it was over $10 billion. But the attorney pushed back, contending the figure is actually $18 billion,” the report mentioned.

Apart from Epic Games, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is facing two separate US Justice Department lawsuits related to alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant had earlier told the court.

Google has been defending its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google defends against antitrust accusations citing innovation and competition,https://in.investing.com/news/google-defends-against-antitrust-accusations-citing-innovation-and-competition-93CH-3901834,"WASHINGTON - Google (NASDAQ: ) is nearing the end of its defense in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit, with the U.S. et al. v. Google case set to conclude after a final government rebuttal. The tech giant has been contending with allegations from the Justice Department and state attorneys general that it holds a monopoly over search and advertising markets.

During the proceedings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood by the company's practice of paying for default search engine status on devices from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms, revealing that Google shared 36% of search revenue from these deals with Apple. Kevin Murphy, an economic expert for Google, provided testimony to support this claim.

Google's defense also pointed to instances where competition influenced market decisions, such as Mozilla's temporary shift from Google to Yahoo in 2014 due to product quality issues, only to return to Google in 2017 following a decline in Yahoo’s user experience.

Prabhakar Raghavan, head of search at Google, emphasized the firm's dedication to advancing technology through significant research and development investments. This commitment was contrasted with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella's vague responses regarding Microsoft's investment in its own search engine Bing during cross-examination.

The government has accused Google of several anti-competitive behaviors, including delaying the launch of generative AI technology until after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT and considering an incognito search engine that would not store user data—a move that could have potentially cost the company billions in revenue. Additionally, the government alleged that Google manipulated ad prices during times of revenue shortfall.

In response, Google cited its long history of fostering competition by introducing transformative products such as its search engine in 1998, the Chrome browser in 2008, and the Android operating system in 2008. The company also highlighted its competition with newer entrants like TikTok and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which have become alternative sources of online information.

The outcome of this landmark case rests with Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is expected to issue a verdict next year. The decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader tech industry as debates over antitrust laws and digital market dominance continue.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is currently navigating through a challenging antitrust lawsuit. Despite a prediction from Barclays (LON: ) that the tech giant may face a defeat in the U.S. antitrust case, Alphabet's shares experienced an unexpected rise, increasing by 1.5% today. This legal battle has been brought into sharper focus following expert testimony on Monday that disclosed Google derives a significant 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari users.

The spotlight on Google's revenue-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) could provide leverage to regulatory authorities like the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The authority may consider enforcing measures similar to those used in Europe, such as ""choice screens"" for search engines and limits on revenue sharing. These measures have been implemented on some Android devices in Europe but have had limited impact on Alphabet's market valuation.

Despite these challenges, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on Alphabet's financial prospects.

The case against Google has been gaining momentum since earlier in November 2022, when Barclays raised concerns about the formidable case built by the U.S. Justice Department. The unique market dynamics of iOS devices in the U.S., which are due to evolve in 2024, could exacerbate the impact if Google were to lose this legal dispute. This outcome could lead Apple to consider alternatives for its search service, potentially partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing or developing its own search engine.

“For example, this could be an AI-generated video that realistically depicts an event that never happened, or content showing someone saying or doing something they didn't actually do,” said the company.

This is important in cases where the content discusses sensitive topics, such as elections, ongoing conflicts and public health crises, or public officials.

The company warned that creators who consistently choose not to disclose this information may be subject to content removal, suspension from the YouTube Partner Programme, or other penalties.

“We’ll work with creators before this rolls out to make sure they understand these new requirements,” said YouTube.

The company will inform viewers that content may be altered or synthetic in two ways.

A new label will be added to the description panel indicating that some of the content was altered or synthetic. And for certain types of content about sensitive topics, we’ll apply a more prominent label to the video player.

“There are also some areas where a label alone may not be enough to mitigate the risk of harm, and some synthetic media, regardless of whether it’s labeled, will be removed from our platform if it violates our Community Guidelines,” the company informed.

Content created by YouTube’s generative AI products and features will also be clearly labeled as altered or synthetic.

In the coming months, YouTube will make it possible to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice, using our privacy request process.

“Not all content will be removed from YouTube, and we’ll consider a variety of factors when evaluating these requests. This could include whether the content is parody or satire, whether the person making the request can be uniquely identified, or whether it features a public official or well-known individual, in which case there may be a higher bar,” the company explained.

The platform is also introducing the ability for its music partners to request the removal of AI-generated music content that mimics an artist’s unique singing or rapping voice.

These removal requests will be available to labels or distributors who represent artists participating in YouTube’s early AI music experiments.

AI’s powerful new forms of storytelling can also be used to generate content that has the potential to mislead viewers — particularly if they’re unaware that the video has been altered or is synthetically created.

“To address this concern, over the coming months, we’ll introduce updates that inform viewers when the content they’re seeing is synthetic,” YouTube added.

2022-11-20, Investing.com,Wells Fargo sets $70 target for Arm Holdings on strong growth outlook,https://in.investing.com/news/wells-fargo-sets-70-target-for-arm-holdings-on-strong-growth-outlook-93CH-3906358,"Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ), the British semiconductor titan, received a bullish assessment from Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) analysts today. Initiating coverage, they assigned an Overweight rating to the company with a $70 price target. This optimistic stance is based on expectations of substantial top-line growth in fiscal year 2024, predicted at around 13%. The company's shares responded positively to the news, ticking up by 0.8%.

Arm has been in the spotlight since its initial public offering on September 14, 2022, marking its transition into the public markets. The company has since reported earnings that exceeded quarterly expectations and projected third-quarter revenues to land between $720 million and $800 million. Although this forecast falls slightly below the anticipated $776 million, Arm continues to draw strength from high-profile clients such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

Despite mixed reactions to near-term revenue projections earlier in November, analysts from BofA Securities have maintained a Buy rating on Arm. The analysts' confidence in the company stems from its potential to outpace competitors over the next three years through market share expansion and increased royalty rates.

Arm's CFO Jason Child also contributed to the positive outlook, hinting at ""pretty significant growth"" driven by sizeable license agreements expected in the fourth quarter. The company's robust licensing prospects and strong market positioning reinforce analyst confidence in its growth trajectory.

""I literally was trapped by addiction at age 12. And I did not get my life back for all of my teenage years,” Taylor Little, now 21, was quoted as saying in the report that came out on Monday.

Taylor's social media addiction led to suicide attempts and years of depression.

""If I had my phone taken away, it felt like having withdrawals. It was unbearable. Literally, when I say it was addictive, I don't mean it was habit-forming. I mean, my body and mind craved that,” she was quoted as saying.

Taylor also struggled with content around body image and eating disorders.

Taylor and hundreds of other American families are suing four of the biggest tech companies -- Meta (parent company of Facebook and Instagram), TikTok, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Snap Inc (NYSE: ) (parent of Snapchat).

“Lawyers for the families believe the case of 14-year-old British schoolgirl Molly Russell is an important example of the potential harms faced by teenagers,” the BBC report noted.

Russell, a seemingly happy teenager from northwest London, was found dead in her bedroom in November 2017.

It later emerged she had viewed masses of content related to suicide, depression and anxiety online.

Russell's name is mentioned a dozen times in the master complaint submitted to the court in California.

In a breather for these families, a federal court in the US last week rejected social media giants’ motion to dismiss dozens of lawsuits, accusing them of running platforms ""addictive"" to kids and allegedly spreading child sex abuse materials.

US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected their motion, saying that Meta, ByteDance, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Snap (Snapchat’s parent company) must proceed with a lawsuit alleging their social platforms have adverse mental health effects on children.

""Because children still developing impulse control are uniquely susceptible to harms arising out of compulsive use of social media platforms, defendants have 'created a youth mental health crisis' through the defective design of their platforms,"" according to the ruling.

""Further, these platforms facilitate and contribute to the sexual exploitation and sextortion of children, as well as the ongoing production and spread of child sex abuse materials (CSAM) online. To that end, defendants know that children use their products, both from public and internal data,"" the ruling read.

Lawyers for the families called it a ""significant victory"".

In a statement, Meta said that their thoughts are with the families represented in these complaints.

""We want to reassure every parent that we have their interests at heart in the work we are doing to provide teens with safe, supportive experiences online,” the social media giant said.

Google said that the allegations in these complaints are “simply not true”.

“Protecting kids across our platforms has always been core to our work,” the company said.

Snapchat said its platform ""was designed to remove the pressure to be perfect. We vet all content before it can reach a large audience to prevent the spread of anything that could be harmful.""

2022-11-18, Investing.com,Nvidia maintains lead in AI market as AMD faces challenges,https://in.investing.com/news/nvidia-maintains-lead-in-ai-market-as-amd-faces-challenges-93CH-3905300,"NEW YORK - As the artificial intelligence (AI) sector grows, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is grappling with the challenge of catching up to Nvidia (NASDAQ: )'s lead, primarily due to Nvidia's comprehensive hardware-software ecosystem. Nvidia's data center revenue soared by 31%, while AMD reported an 8% decline in gaming revenues. The success of Nvidia is partly attributed to its CUDA software, which has become a standard in AI development.

Despite these challenges, AMD has seen a surge in sales for its AMD 7000 series laptop chips, with an increase of 41%. This growth comes amidst a broader effort by cloud industry leaders, including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), to develop their own proprietary AI chips to reduce dependence on Nvidia. Yet, these companies continue to invest in Nvidia's products due to its established ecosystem.

Nvidia's strategy of expanding into cloud services aims to reinforce its market position. The company's financial health is robust, with profit margins nearing 25%, significantly outpacing AMD's 4%. This stark contrast in profitability underlines why Nvidia may continue to be a more attractive investment option compared to AMD. Despite projections hinting at AMD's faster growth in 2024, Nvidia is expected to hold onto its leadership position.

Tech giants and investors are closely watching these developments. who holds positions in both AMD and Nvidia as well as other tech firms like Microsoft, Amazon, and Intel (NASDAQ: ), considers his investment in AMD as a strategic hedge against his larger stake in Nvidia. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) has opted not to challenge Nvidia's GPU capabilities for AI tasks, further cementing Nvidia's dominance in the market.

As the AI revolution demands more processing power, both companies are likely to remain critical players. However, for now, Nvidia's combined hardware-software offerings give it an edge reminiscent of Intel’s past market dominance but with the added leverage of being a crucial software provider akin to Microsoft. In contrast, AMD continues to navigate the market as a secondary supplier.

2022-11-17, IANS,AI to power 2nd major revolution in Internet with $1 tn investments,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-power-2nd-major-revolution-in-internet-with-1-tn-investments-3905181,"Washington, Nov 18 (IANS) Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to power the second major revolution in the internet, better known as the Information Superhighway, with major tech companies pouring billions of dollars into research to make what was science fiction yesterday a reality today. The AI-powered market could exceed $1 trillion by 2026 with applications across a wide spectrum of industries from healthcare to automobiles to manufacturing processes. ChatGPT probably kicked off the AI revolution in the next stage of the internet through OpenAI. But the information superhighway now needs a major expansion, technology publications say.

AI has triggered a new tech boom that will make the boom in internet stocks in the 1990s look tame.

The AI investing cycles generally begin with build outs on hardware first, very similar to the internet in the 1990s.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ) and other tech firms are expected to spend $250 billion in hardware over the next year, says Colin Tedards, Editor, The Bleeding Edge.

Most of Bleeding Edge's information comes out of Brownstone Research firm's insight into chips and semiconductor technologies through its research papers.

As more companies join the AI race, spending ramps up.

US's largest AI chipmaker Nvidia says the bill will top $1 trillion in the next three years. That's why shares of Nvidia and other AI hardware makers went berserk this year. Nvidia's share price tripled. Super Micro Computer, which makes high-performance server and storage systems for AI training, is up 250 per cent this year.

And 'Onto Innovation', which sells semiconductor inspection equipment, has rallied 101 per cent year-to-date. And these gains are just the start…., says Tedards.

AI is an even more powerful technology… with even more profound implications for the economy… than the internet was. So, expect the gains from the AI boom to eclipse the gains folks made in the 1990s.

More Than Just ChatGPT: AI's will not only help us search for information online. They'll also help educate our kids… drive our cars and trucks… diagnose and treat diseases… and help us solve some of the hardest problems facing humanity, the editor of the tech publication said.

For instance, researchers are already using AI to help us achieve nuclear fusion. That would be an infinite energy source to power the planet that doesn't emit any CO2. Fusion releases nearly four million times more energy than burning coal, oil or gas. This makes fusion a potential source of base load energy, which is the minimum amount of electricity needed to power the energy grid at any given time.

Most people have not realised the power of AI yet. All they see are doomsday scenarios. And that's not a surprise. Washington wants us to be afraid of AI so that it can regulate it, he said.

But AI is about to enter an age of abundance that will make our heads spin. And when you have a megatrend like that, the gains on offer are potentially life-changing. Especially if you invest in the early stages of the boom before stock prices skyrocket. Brokerages are recommending stock buyers to invest in AI infrastructure stocks to profit. There are tiny companies to invest in as compared to tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

But like Cisco (NASDAQ: ) during the internet boom, they will build the physical infrastructure needed to make the AI revolution possible. If history is a guide to go by then, we have the chance to earn 10 times or more of our money. AI has reached a level of intelligence far higher than what we hear about on the news. AI systems have started to evolve and change… in ways not even their creators understand. The AI explosion we've seen since the launch of ChatGPT last November has blown our minds away, the editor said.

Today, we take the internet for granted. We have remote meetings with work colleagues… We video call family and friends… we stream music, TV shows and music… we book flights and hotels… and we do our shopping online.

Nearly five billion people around the world account for 60 per cent of the planet's population. But before this became a reality, companies poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building out the physical infrastructure. Most people are clueless or don't even think about the enormity of how the internet works. But 750,000 miles of fibre-optic cables criss-cross between continents on the ocean floor. That's enough to wrap around Earth more than 30 times.

Add to that land-based cable networks, and one is looking at millions of miles of cabling. There are also close to 400 million internet servers -- most of them housed in giant data centres. They are the bartenders of the digital world. They serve up the movies, songs, images, and text that make up the internet, Tedard says.

It's the reason people called the internet the Information Superhighway. It's the physical infrastructure that makes our digital lives possible. The companies that built this highway delivered fortune-making returns. We have another shot to profit as we build out a new Information Superhighway for the AI revolution. First, one must grasp the scale of the gains on offer in the late 1990s when the internet boom was underway.

Gap's (NYSE: ) quarterly profit tops estimates, sending shares soaring premarket, but the retailer joins peers Target (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) in flagging some caution over consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. Elsewhere, Chinese tech shares plummet after Alibaba (NYSE: ) scraps a planned spin-off of its cloud intelligence unit.

1. Futures tick mostly higher

U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, but remained relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested a week of key economic data and an ebbing stream of corporate earnings.

By 04:38 ET (09:38 GMT), the contract had edged up by 66 points or 0.2%, had risen by 8 points or 0.2%, and were mostly unchanged.

In the prior session, the 30-stock shed 1%, ending a four-day streak of gains, while the benchmark and tech-heavy both climbed by 0.1%. All three of the main indices on Wall Street remain on pace for their third consecutive positive week.

Sentiment in recent days has been aided by soft data for both consumer and wholesale prices in October, which have bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve may have reached the end of an unprecedented and long-standing campaign of interest rate hikes. Whether this optimism can hold firm in the weeks to come remains a key source of debate among investors.

2. Gap's earnings beat

Shares in Gap surged in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after the retailer posted higher-than-anticipated third-quarter income, although the firm flagged some caution over trading in the key holiday quarter.

In the three months to Oct. 28, the owner of brands like Athleta and Banana Republic reported adjusted profit of $0.59 per share, trouncing Bloomberg consensus estimates of $0.19, thanks in part to cost cutting measures and strength at its Old Navy division.

Net sales growth in the current quarter is seen coming in flat to slightly negative, disappointing expectations that it would forecast an increase of 0.33%, according to LSEG numbers cited by Reuters. Sales at Banana Republic and Athleta, in particular, are seen falling during the period, which includes the crucial holiday shopping season.

The San Francisco-based company, which has been hit by increased competition from peers like Shein and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), conceded that it still needs to create ""trend-right product assortments"" to bring more customers back into its stores.

Gap's outlook echoes comments this week from peers Target and Walmart, in a sign that retail chains are still wary of the spending habits of inflation-squeezed consumers.

3. Apple announces plan to support messaging standard

Apple (NASDAQ: ) has said it plans to adopt a smartphone-industry messaging standard, boosting hopes for a smoother and more even-handed texting experience between iPhone and Android gadgets.

In a statement on Thursday, California-based Apple said it will begin to add support for so-called rich communication services (RCS) later next year, adding it will offer ""better interoperability"" between operating systems. RCS, which is widely included in a variety of phones, allows users to see read notifications and receive high-quality videos or photos, among a host of other features.

Apple has so far resisted pressure from Google (NASDAQ: ) and other phone makers to make the change to RCS, a reluctance exemplified by an ongoing debate between green and blue bubbles. At the moment, texts shared between iPhones and Androids appear in a green bubble -- instead of the typical blue -- for the iPhone user.

Although it was not certain if the different colored bubbles would soon disappear, Google welcomed the news, saying it was ""happy to see"" Apple ""coming on board to embrace RCS.""

4. Chinese tech stocks slide

Chinese technology stocks plummeted on Friday, with Alibaba Group (HK: ) (NYSE: ) leading losses after the e-commerce giant shelved a planned spin-off of its cloud unit.

Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares slid 10.0%, touching a one-year low, and were by far the worst performer on the , which fell 1.9%.

The firm’s rivals Baidu (HK: ) (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent (HK: ), fell 4.9% and 3.0%, respectively.

Alibaba said on Thursday that it was no longer proceeding with a proposed demerger of its cloud business, citing the impact of enhanced U.S. controls on exports of advanced computing chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China.

The move threatens to rupture a major pillar of Alibaba's long-stated goal of splitting into six separate entities in a bid to appease regulators in Beijing and stimulate growth.

5. Oil on track for weekly loss

Oil prices edged higher Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight negative week, as traders grappled with signs of rising supplies and fears of worsening global demand.

By 04:40 ET, the futures had gained 0.9% to $73.53 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.8% to $78.05 per barrel. Both contracts are around 5% lower this week, near four-month lows.

This week’s sharp drop was partly triggered by a steep jump in American crude inventories. Data showing the first fall in U.S. retail sales in seven months and an easing in Chinese oil refinery throughput in October also exacerbated concerns that fuel demand may have been weakening at the start of the final quarter of the year."
2022-11-17, Investing.com,"Apple to support RCS messaging, boosting Android interoperability",https://in.investing.com/news/apple-to-support-rcs-messaging-boosting-android-interoperability-93CH-3904322,"CUPERTINO - In a strategic pivot, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has announced its plan to adopt the Rich Communication Services (RCS) Universal Profile, a messaging standard widely used by Android devices, including those from tech rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (KS: ). This move marks a significant shift from Apple's previous stance on messaging interoperability and comes as the company faces regulatory pressure from the European Union's Digital Markets Act.

The integration of RCS into iPhones, starting with the iPhone 15 series, is expected to enhance user experience by improving cross-platform messaging capabilities. RCS is set to replace traditional SMS and MMS services, offering a richer communication experience akin to Apple's own iMessage platform. While iMessage is known for its robust privacy features, including end-to-end encryption, RCS does not currently offer the same level of security. Nevertheless, Apple is committed to maintaining user privacy and continues to promote iMessage as its premier messaging service due to its superior security measures.

The announcement on Thursday aligns with the appeal deadline for the EU's Digital Markets Act, which mandates service interoperability among large technology firms. In 2022, Apple's CEO Tim Cook dismissed the idea of adopting cross-platform RCS, advocating instead for consumers to purchase iPhones to enjoy exclusive iMessage features. However, this policy change indicates a more collaborative approach to messaging standards and could potentially reshape how iPhone users communicate with Android users.

By supporting RCS Universal Profile, Apple is taking steps toward creating a more unified messaging ecosystem that transcends device boundaries while attempting to uphold its commitment to user privacy and security.

“At this initial phase, the experiment is designed to help explore how the technology could be used to create deeper connections between artists and creators, and ultimately, their fans,” said Lyor Cohen, global head of music at YouTube.

Nine artists including Alec Benjamin, Charlie Puth, Charli XCX, Demi Lovato, John Legend, Papoose, Sia, T-Pain, and Troye Sivan have chosen to collaborate in this experiment and work with YouTube to shape the future of AI in musi.

“They are giving a small group of select US creators the chance to create unique soundtracks of up to 30 seconds for their Shorts,” Cohen added.

YouTube is also experimenting with AI tools that can generate music tracks from a hum.

“The artists, songwriters and producers in the Music AI Incubator are helping us test, learn, gain feedback and hear ideas so that we can develop the best experiences possible for our community of artists, viewers and fans,” said the company.

Imagine being able to more seamlessly turn one's thoughts and ideas into music; like creating a new guitar riff just by humming it or taking a pop track you are working on and giving it a reggaeton feel.

2022-11-16, IANS,Platforms with AI bias won't get sanctuary under safe harbour provision: MoS IT,https://in.investing.com/news/platforms-with-ai-bias-wont-get-sanctuary-under-safe-harbour-provision-mos-it-3903547,"New Delhi, Nov 16 (IANS) Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said on Thursday that safe harbour provision will not apply for social media platforms if they promote search, algorithmic bias or AI bias. Responding to a user on 'X', the minister said that search bias, algorithmic bias and AI models with bias are real violations of the safety and trust obligations placed on platforms under Rule 3(1)(b) of IT rules under regulatory framework in India.

""Those who are aggrieved by this can file FIRs against such platforms and safe harbor/immunity under Sec 79 will not apply to these cases,"" he told the X user.

The safe harbour provision gives social media platforms legal immunity against content shared by users on their respective platforms.

The government intends to remove such provisions in the Digital India Bill.

The X user posted screenshots of a conversation with Google (NASDAQ: ) Bard where he asked the platform to summarise an article by a news website but Bard responded, saying it cannot summarise the article as the platform allegedly spreads false information and is biased.

Last month, the Ministry of Electronics and IT issued notices to social media intermediaries X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, and Telegram, warning them to remove any kind of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) from their platforms on the Indian internet or face action.

""The government is determined to build a safe and trusted internet under the IT rules. The rules under the IT Act lay down strict expectations from social media intermediaries that they should not allow criminal or harmful posts on their platforms. If they do not act swiftly, their safe harbour under section 79 of the IT Act would be withdrawn and consequences under the Indian law will follow,"" the minister had warned.

Google-owned YouTube had said it did not detect any kind of CSAM on its platform. Encrypted messaging platform Telegram said it is ""always committed"" to upholding legal and ethical standards on its platform.

2022-11-16, IANS,Google makes Bard chatbot available for teens with some guardrails,https://in.investing.com/news/google-makes-bard-chatbot-available-for-teens-with-some-guardrails-3903209,"New Delhi, Nov 16 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has announced to make its AI chatbot called Bard available for teens in most countries with some guardrails in place.According to Tulsee Doshi, Head of Product, Responsible AI at Google, the company will open up access to Bard to teenagers in most countries around the world on Thursday.

“Teens in those countries who meet the minimum age requirement to manage their own Google Account will be able to access Bard in English, with more languages to come over time,” said Doshi.

Before launching to teens, the tech giant consulted with child safety and development experts to help shape its content policies and an experience that prioritises safety.

“Organisations like the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) advised us on how to keep the needs of teens and families in mind,” Doshi added.

Teens can use Bard to find inspiration, discover new hobbies and solve everyday problems. Bard can also be a helpful learning tool for teens, allowing them to dig deeper into topics, better understand complex concepts and practice new skills in ways that work best for them.

“For even more interactive learning, we’re bringing a math learning experience into Bard. Anyone, including teens, can simply type or upload a picture of a math equation, and Bard won’t just give the answer — it’ll share step-by-step explanations of how to solve it,” said Doshi.

Bard will be able to help with data visualisation, too.

""FOSI's research found that most teens and parents expect that GenAI skills will be an important part of their future,” according to Stephen Balkam, Founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.

Teens also shared feedback with Google directly that they have questions about how to use generative AI and what its limitations might be.

“We’ve trained Bard to recognise areas that are inappropriate to younger users and implemented safety features and guardrails to help prevent unsafe content, such as illegal or age-gated substances, from appearing in its responses to teens,” said the company.

“We also recognise that many people, including teens, are not always aware of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs),” Doshi noted.

LLMs are prone to “hallucinating,” which means that they can generate text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical.

“So the first time a teen asks a fact-based question, we’ll automatically run our double-check response feature, which helps evaluate whether there’s content across the web to substantiate Bard’s response,” the company said.

2022-11-15, Investing.com,Microsoft and Alphabet intensify AI competition with new tools,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-and-alphabet-intensify-ai-competition-with-new-tools-93CH-3902343,"In the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence (AI) space, tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are escalating their rivalry with the development of advanced AI-driven tools aimed at enhancing user productivity and information accessibility. Microsoft has taken an early lead in this race with its strategic investment in OpenAI, which has borne fruit in the form of Copilot, an AI-powered tool integrated into Microsoft 365 suite.

Copilot has been making waves by boosting productivity for businesses, leveraging the capabilities of AI to streamline tasks and improve efficiency. This tool is part of Microsoft's broader push to incorporate AI into its widely-used office software, potentially transforming how professionals interact with applications like Word, Excel, and Outlook.

On the other side of this competitive landscape, Alphabet is not standing still. The company is preparing to launch Google Duet, an initiative that aims to capitalize on its already strong assets such as Google Search and YouTube. Google Duet is expected to enhance these platforms by embedding more sophisticated AI functionalities into them.

Despite Microsoft's current edge and the impressive milestone of ChatGPT reaching 100 million weekly active users, Alphabet's forthcoming projects could shift the balance. The company is working on Bard and Gemini, two projects that have the potential to outshine their rivals in the long term. Bard, which is already in the conversation, along with the anticipated Gemini, could offer superior chatbot capabilities that would not only improve user experience but also significantly impact how users interact with Google's search engine and YouTube.

An attorney for Epic asked Pichai if the detail presented by Google’s witness was accurate.

“That’s correct,” Pichai responded.

About the Samsung (KS: ) deal, Pichai told the court that “it’s like apples and oranges”.

The Google CEO added that the deals sometimes pay carriers.

He later said that Google competes “fiercely with Apple.”

“The attorney for Epic also asked Pichai about the exact dollar amount it pays to Apple, to which Pichai said it was over $10 billion. But the attorney pushed back, contending the figure is actually $18 billion,” the report mentioned.

Apart from Epic Games, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) is facing two separate US Justice Department lawsuits related to alleged anti-competitive behaviour.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant had earlier told the court.

Google has been defending its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google defends against antitrust accusations citing innovation and competition,https://in.investing.com/news/google-defends-against-antitrust-accusations-citing-innovation-and-competition-93CH-3901834,"WASHINGTON - Google (NASDAQ: ) is nearing the end of its defense in a high-stakes antitrust lawsuit, with the U.S. et al. v. Google case set to conclude after a final government rebuttal. The tech giant has been contending with allegations from the Justice Department and state attorneys general that it holds a monopoly over search and advertising markets.

During the proceedings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai stood by the company's practice of paying for default search engine status on devices from Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms, revealing that Google shared 36% of search revenue from these deals with Apple. Kevin Murphy, an economic expert for Google, provided testimony to support this claim.

Google's defense also pointed to instances where competition influenced market decisions, such as Mozilla's temporary shift from Google to Yahoo in 2014 due to product quality issues, only to return to Google in 2017 following a decline in Yahoo’s user experience.

Prabhakar Raghavan, head of search at Google, emphasized the firm's dedication to advancing technology through significant research and development investments. This commitment was contrasted with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) CEO Satya Nadella's vague responses regarding Microsoft's investment in its own search engine Bing during cross-examination.

The government has accused Google of several anti-competitive behaviors, including delaying the launch of generative AI technology until after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT and considering an incognito search engine that would not store user data—a move that could have potentially cost the company billions in revenue. Additionally, the government alleged that Google manipulated ad prices during times of revenue shortfall.

In response, Google cited its long history of fostering competition by introducing transformative products such as its search engine in 1998, the Chrome browser in 2008, and the Android operating system in 2008. The company also highlighted its competition with newer entrants like TikTok and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), which have become alternative sources of online information.

The outcome of this landmark case rests with Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is expected to issue a verdict next year. The decision will likely have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader tech industry as debates over antitrust laws and digital market dominance continue.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Barclays anticipates Google defeat in antitrust case, stock rises",https://in.investing.com/news/barclays-anticipates-google-defeat-in-antitrust-case-stock-rises-93CH-3901779,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, is currently navigating through a challenging antitrust lawsuit. Despite a prediction from Barclays (LON: ) that the tech giant may face a defeat in the U.S. antitrust case, Alphabet's shares experienced an unexpected rise, increasing by 1.5% today. This legal battle has been brought into sharper focus following expert testimony on Monday that disclosed Google derives a significant 36% of its search advertising revenue from Safari users.

The spotlight on Google's revenue-sharing agreement with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: ) could provide leverage to regulatory authorities like the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The authority may consider enforcing measures similar to those used in Europe, such as ""choice screens"" for search engines and limits on revenue sharing. These measures have been implemented on some Android devices in Europe but have had limited impact on Alphabet's market valuation.

Despite these challenges, Wall Street maintains a positive outlook on Alphabet's financial prospects.

The case against Google has been gaining momentum since earlier in November 2022, when Barclays raised concerns about the formidable case built by the U.S. Justice Department. The unique market dynamics of iOS devices in the U.S., which are due to evolve in 2024, could exacerbate the impact if Google were to lose this legal dispute. This outcome could lead Apple to consider alternatives for its search service, potentially partnering with Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing or developing its own search engine.

“For example, this could be an AI-generated video that realistically depicts an event that never happened, or content showing someone saying or doing something they didn't actually do,” said the company.

This is important in cases where the content discusses sensitive topics, such as elections, ongoing conflicts and public health crises, or public officials.

The company warned that creators who consistently choose not to disclose this information may be subject to content removal, suspension from the YouTube Partner Programme, or other penalties.

“We’ll work with creators before this rolls out to make sure they understand these new requirements,” said YouTube.

The company will inform viewers that content may be altered or synthetic in two ways.

A new label will be added to the description panel indicating that some of the content was altered or synthetic. And for certain types of content about sensitive topics, we’ll apply a more prominent label to the video player.

“There are also some areas where a label alone may not be enough to mitigate the risk of harm, and some synthetic media, regardless of whether it’s labeled, will be removed from our platform if it violates our Community Guidelines,” the company informed.

Content created by YouTube’s generative AI products and features will also be clearly labeled as altered or synthetic.

In the coming months, YouTube will make it possible to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic or altered content that simulates an identifiable individual, including their face or voice, using our privacy request process.

“Not all content will be removed from YouTube, and we’ll consider a variety of factors when evaluating these requests. This could include whether the content is parody or satire, whether the person making the request can be uniquely identified, or whether it features a public official or well-known individual, in which case there may be a higher bar,” the company explained.

The platform is also introducing the ability for its music partners to request the removal of AI-generated music content that mimics an artist’s unique singing or rapping voice.

These removal requests will be available to labels or distributors who represent artists participating in YouTube’s early AI music experiments.

AI’s powerful new forms of storytelling can also be used to generate content that has the potential to mislead viewers — particularly if they’re unaware that the video has been altered or is synthetically created.

“To address this concern, over the coming months, we’ll introduce updates that inform viewers when the content they’re seeing is synthetic,” YouTube added.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google wraps up defense in major antitrust lawsuit,https://in.investing.com/news/google-wraps-up-defense-in-major-antitrust-lawsuit-93CH-3901346,"Google (NASDAQ: ) has concluded its defense in a significant antitrust case heard by Judge Amit P. Mehta at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where it stands accused by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general of illegally monopolizing the search and advertising markets. A decision in the case is expected sometime in 2024.

In today's final arguments, Google's defense hinged on three primary points: the rationale behind its business strategies, evidence of robust competition in the search market, and its positive influence on consumers and overall market competition.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand to justify the company's financial dealings with Apple (NASDAQ: ), explaining that paying for default search engine status on Apple devices was a strategic move meant to boost search usage and revenue. In 2021, Google invested a substantial $26.3 billion to secure its position as the default search engine across various platforms, dedicating $18 billion of that amount to Apple alone.

Addressing claims of monopolistic behavior, Google's legal team pointed to instances of competition within the search engine space. They highlighted Mozilla's temporary adoption of Yahoo as their default search engine in 2014, which ultimately reverted back following user feedback, as an example that other players have had opportunities to enter and compete in the market.

Prabhakar Raghavan, Google’s head of search, emphasized the company's hefty $40 billion investment in research and development over the past year. He stated that such investments have allowed Google to deliver superior technology and services to users. Furthermore, Google argued that its entrance into various markets has actually stimulated more competition rather than stifling it.

The case against Google has been closely watched as it touches on broader concerns about the power wielded by tech giants and their influence on consumer choices and market dynamics. As both sides await a verdict next year, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how digital markets are regulated and how tech companies operate globally.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Google antitrust trial mirrors Microsoft case, nearing conclusion",https://in.investing.com/news/google-antitrust-trial-mirrors-microsoft-case-nearing-conclusion-93CH-3901280,"The high-profile antitrust trial involving tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which commenced in September, is approaching its final stages, with expectations to conclude around Thanksgiving. The legal battle has seen Google defending itself against accusations that it has established an unassailable market position in the search engine sector, similar to the monopoly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) held over PC software in the 1990s.

The prosecution, comprising the Justice Department along with several states, asserts that Google's dominance is built upon user-generated data, creating a significant barrier to entry for any would-be competitors. This narrative draws parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft over two decades ago. In response, Google's defense attorney John Schmidtlein has emphasized the diminishing impact of data accumulation and credits Google's leading position to their substantial investment in human resources and software development.

Central to the case are Google's pay-for-default agreements with major technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). These deals have been flagged by Judge Amit P. Mehta as the ""heart of the case,"" indicating their potential influence on the trial's outcome.

As the proceedings advanced into October, Schmidtlein sought to distinguish Google's circumstances from those of Microsoft by suggesting that barriers to competition in today's search market are less insurmountable than what was seen with personal computer software in the '90s. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this line of reasoning, maintaining his stance on using the Microsoft litigation as a benchmark for this trial.

With a verdict on the horizon, discussions around possible remedies have come into focus. Google maintains that it operates within a fair competitive landscape, while government officials are advocating for stringent sanctions to counteract the company's alleged anticompetitive practices.

The trial's outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader technology industry, particularly concerning how digital markets and user data are regulated. As closing arguments near, all eyes are on Judge Mehta's decision and its potential to reshape the landscape of tech monopolies.

2022-11-14, IANS,Trump’s micro-blogging platform Truth Social loses $73 mn since launch,https://in.investing.com/news/trumps-microblogging-platform-truth-social-loses-73-mn-since-launch-3901211,"San Francisco, Nov 14 (IANS) Former US president Donald Trump’s micro-blogging platform Truth Social has suffered $73 million net loss since its launch in February 2022.A new filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has revealed that the social media platform suffered $50 million net loss last year and $23 million in the first half of 2022.

According to the filing, Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) accountants have raised “substantial doubt” about the platform’s future without help from that long delayed SPAC merger.

Truth Social was generally made available in the first quarter of 2022.

“The company prides itself on operating its platform, to the best of its ability, without relying on Big Tech companies. Partnering with pro-free-speech alternative technology firms, TMTG fully launched Truth Social for iOS in April 2022. TMTG debuted the Truth Social web application in May 2022, and the Truth Social Android App became available in the Samsung (KS: ) Galaxy and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play stores in October 2022,” according to the filing.

TMTG introduced direct messaging to all versions of Truth Social in 2022, released a “Groups” feature for users in May 2022, and announced the general availability of Truth Social internationally in June 2022.

Since its launch, Truth Social has experienced substantial growth, claimed the filing.

In September, Truth Social got a lifeline after Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company, that could infuse the social media platform with cash agreed to extend a critical deadline for a year.

Digital World shareholders agreed to extend the deadline again with about 72 per cent of shareholders voting to push the merger deadline until September 8, 2024, according to the company.

A merger would release to Trump Media $290 million held by Digital World and another $1 billion that private investors had committed to the combined company, PBS reported.

Trump’s company remains on its own, paying staff, leases and other expenses from $36 million raised from earlier sales of promissory notes, the report noted.

Meanwhile, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has expressed expectations of receiving further funding from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ). OpenAI has been at the forefront of AI development and research, and additional support from Microsoft could further accelerate its projects, including the highly publicized language model ChatGPT.

In policy news, former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who had previously come under fire for his lobbying efforts on behalf of Greensill Capital, has taken on a new role as foreign secretary. This appointment has raised eyebrows given his past controversies but indicates a potential shift in political dynamics.

Additionally, several Silicon Valley billionaires are reportedly distancing themselves from former President Donald Trump. Notable figures such as Peter Thiel have been prominent supporters in the past but seem to be reevaluating their political affiliations as the landscape evolves.

In other developments, despite a decrease in seismic activity near Iceland's main airport, authorities remain on alert for possible volcanic eruptions. The region is known for its volcanic activity and continues to be closely monitored by scientists and emergency services.

Lastly, a recent study suggests that Google should compensate U.S. news publishers with an annual sum of $10 billion for using their content. The recommendation highlights ongoing discussions about the value and monetization of journalistic work in the digital age.

As these stories unfold, investors and industry observers will be watching closely to see how these strategic moves and policy developments impact their respective sectors and the broader market landscape.

The initiative includes multiple bonuses aimed at attracting European users, as the company looks to fill the gap left by Binance's recent discontinuation of its Visa (NYSE: ) card services in the region.

Bybit's promotional efforts come on the heels of regulatory challenges that have seen competitors scale back their operations. Earlier in October, Binance opted to retire its Visa card in Europe, redirecting residents to its homepage instead of the Crypto Card portal. The decision was influenced by Binance's desire to concentrate on its primary business activities amidst a tightening regulatory landscape.

In contrast, Bybit is pressing forward with confidence, having launched its Mastercard service in March 2022. The card facilitates crypto-to-fiat transactions and is accepted at over 90 million merchants worldwide that support Mastercard. VIP members benefit from additional perks such as increased loyalty points and cashback rewards.

Bybit announced an incentive program specifically for European customers, featuring a 10 EUR signup bonus, a 5 EUR reward for the first transaction, and an additional 10 EUR for the first deposit made on the platform. This competitive strategy is indicative of Bybit’s commitment to growth in Europe. The firm is not deterred by the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence requirements imposed by the EU's MiCA regulations earlier in July 2022.

While Binance has stepped back due to regulatory concerns and a challenging operational environment following new EEA regulations, Bybit is positioning itself as a viable alternative for European crypto investors. The exchange has also announced future plans to integrate its Mastercard service with mobile payment platforms Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, which will further extend its usability across various merchant locations that accept Mastercard.

The JoonAng report claimed that the production target for the Samsung headset will be 30,000 units for 2024.

The South Korean giant has apparently commissioned higher resolution screens from Samsung Display for its XR headset.

Samsung has reportedly communicated to developers that its new MR headset will launch at the end of 2024.

The price of the Samsung headset is likely to be around $2,000, compared to $3,499 for the Apple Vision Pro.

In December, South Korean news outlet ETNews reported Samsung had built prototypes of a headset and planned to ship samples to developers in 2022.

In September, mobile carrier LG Uplus said it has formed an alliance with global telecom operators, content developers and chipmaker Qualcomm to develop 5G-based augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) content to boost the budding industry.

The tool gives small online platforms access to a central database of content deemed to be created by terrorist organisations, reports The Wired.

The database, maintained by the UN-backed online counter-terrorism group Tech Against Terrorism, is already used by major tech companies.

“The tool aims to give smaller platforms the ability to easily and efficiently detect terrorist content on their networks and remove it,” the report noted.

The project is also working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an industry-led group founded in 2017 by Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Twitter, and YouTube.

“Islamic State and other terrorist groups didn't give up on the Internet just because they no longer had the megaphone of their social media platforms. They went elsewhere,” Yasmin Green, CEO of Jigsaw, was quoted as saying in the report.

“They found this opportunity to host content on file-hosting sites or other websites, small and medium platforms,” Green added.

‘Altitude’ will also provide context about the terrorist groups the content is associated with.

Apple’s shipments declined by a modest 8 per cent, amounting to 17.2 million units.

The late arrival of the iPhone 15, compared to the timing of the iPhone 14, contributed to the decline.

Samsung (KS: )'s volume recovered slightly compared to Q2 2022 as it shipped 6.8 million units. Its new foldables boosted its performance, which accounted for over 20 per cent of its shipments.

Google (NASDAQ: ) Pixel captured 4 per cent market share, shipping 1.2 million units.

“The US smartphone market is stabilizing, but there is no expectation that Q4 will make a turnaround,” said Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys.

The iPhone 15 series had a strong start in September, accounting for 34 per cent of all iPhone sales in the US during Q3.

“The annual refresh of the iPhone portfolio remains paramount to all carriers, even to smaller challengers such as Boost Infinite, to attract switchers.

2022-11-10, IANS,Sundar Pichai to testify in Epic Games vs Google case next week,https://in.investing.com/news/sundar-pichai-to-testify-in-epic-games-vs-google-case-next-week-3896933,"San Francisco, Nov 10 (IANS) Alphabet and Google (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai is likely to testify in Epic Games’s lawsuit against Google in a US court next week. The Fortnite game developer seeks to call Pichai as a witness on Tuesday as it makes its case alleging that Google Play is an unlawful monopoly, reports The Verge.

“In court documents, Google requested to use a podium in the courtroom on Tuesday, which suggests that Pichai may indeed appear to testify,” the report noted.

Last month, in the US vs. Google case, Pichai stood behind a podium instead of sitting because of “apparent back issues”.

The lawsuit was filed after Google pulled Fortnite from the Play store.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant told the court.

Purnima Kochikar, Vice President, Play Partnerships at Google, said in her testimony that the deal was approved and presented to Epic but not accepted, reports The Verge.

The deal would have seen the money dispensed over a three-year period of “incremental funding” (ending in 2021) to Epic.

In a document justifying the deal, Google wrote that “Fortnite’s absence could result in $130 million (up to $250 million) direct revenue loss with Play” and that there could be a “downstream impact of $550 million (up to $3.6 billion) potential revenue loss if broad contagion to other developers”.

The Epic vs Google trial began this week on Monday. Google has defended its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

The text field in the message box expands and moves to the middle of the screen when tapped, maximising space for text while still keeping the original email visible, the report mentioned.

Google was yet to officially comment on the feature. This appears to be a limited server-side test from Google.

The new message box under testing replaces buttons for Reply, Reply All, and Forward the email you received.

The new message box appears persistently at the bottom of the screen, and you don’t need to scroll to the bottom of an email to see it.

Just like a message writing field in an instant messaging app like Telegram or WhatsApp, one can use the chat-like box to reply to new emails.

One can also use the drop-down on the left side in the message box to change to Reply All, or edit the list of recipients.

On the right side, you get an expand button which brings up the full-screen message composition window you may be accustomed to.

It can be useful if you’re typing out a long message or replying in great detail, the report said.

“The reply setting drop-down and window expansion buttons also moves out of the way to maximize the room available for your text,” it added.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Invesco QQQ Trust's heavy concentration in tech stocks raises volatility risk,https://in.investing.com/news/invesco-qqq-trusts-heavy-concentration-in-tech-stocks-raises-volatility-risk-93CH-3895076,"The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launched on March 10, 1999, and with net assets worth $195 billion, has been under scrutiny due to its high concentration in large tech stocks, which contributes to volatility risk and limits broad diversification.

It was noted that the fund's top ten holdings, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) class A and B, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ), account for about half of the fund's total assets. While the fund has a heavy concentration in tech stocks (57%), the Nasdaq-100 index it tracks is not purely a technology index but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare. This structure may not cater to investors seeking a tech-focused or broadly diversified investment.

Despite its low expense ratio of 0.2% and an annualized return of 8.95%, the fund's concentration in large stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26% of assets) creates volatility risk and hinders broad diversification.

In terms of performance, as of the end of the first three quarters of 2022, its annualized return was 8.95%, nearly identical to the index's return of 9.17%. This suggests that although Invesco QQQ is efficient and performs its intended function well by closely tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, it may not provide the potential for significant growth beyond what investing directly in the Nasdaq-100 index would yield.

While beneficial for investors seeking to mirror the index's performance, this close alignment can be a double-edged sword. It may not offer substantial returns for those seeking significant growth, raising questions about whether this ETF is a suitable choice for all types of investors.

The feedback on recent SGE launches in the US, India and Japan has been positive, and people are finding generative AI particularly useful for complex questions they wouldn’t typically think to search.

“With SGE, we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered,” the company said in a statement.

Search Labs is a new way for people to test early-stage experiments on Search, available on the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop.

“Once you’re enrolled in Search Labs, just enable the SGE experiment to get started. In new countries, access via Chrome desktop is available today, and access through the Google app will be enabled over the coming week,” said Google.

The company is also experimenting with a new way for users to ask follow-up questions directly from the search results page.

As you continue to explore a topic, you can easily see your prior questions and search results, including Search ads in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.

Soon, if you ask Search to translate a phrase where certain words could have more than one possible meaning, you’ll see those terms underlined.

“Tap any of those words and you can indicate the specific meaning that reflects what you want to say. This option may also appear when you need to specify the gender for a particular word,” Google informed.

This AI-powered translation capability is coming soon to the US for English-to-Spanish translations, and “we plan to cover more countries and languages in the near future”.

On relevant searches, you’ll see certain words highlighted, so you can hover over them to preview their definition or view related images.

This update is rolling out over the next month, in English in the US, with more countries and languages expected to follow soon, said Google.

Despite this positive outcome, the company's shares dipped over 3% due to a lower-than-anticipated revenue forecast for the current quarter.

On Wednesday, Arm reported an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.36. However, the company's guidance for the current quarter predicts an EPS between $0.21 and $0.28 on sales ranging from $720 million to $800 million, slightly under Wall Street's projections.

The firm's licensing business saw significant growth over the past year, doubling in size and contributing to a 28% annual increase in total revenue. This growth was reflected in licensing sales, which soared by 106% to $388 million. Conversely, royalty revenue declined by 5%, amounting to $418 million.

Over the course of the quarter, more than 7.1 billion Arm-based chips were shipped. These chips are integrated into a variety of devices including smartphones and PCs, underscoring the company's broad market reach.

Despite these robust figures, Arm experienced a net loss of $110 million due to a one-time share-based compensation worth over $500 million triggered by its IPO at in New York on September 14. The company projects this compensation to be between $150 million and $250 million in future quarters.

In 2022, a proposed sale of Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) was blocked by regulators. Today, major tech companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) utilize Arm's technology in their pursuit of developing AI-capable chips.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,Google wraps up defense in major antitrust lawsuit,https://in.investing.com/news/google-wraps-up-defense-in-major-antitrust-lawsuit-93CH-3901346,"Google (NASDAQ: ) has concluded its defense in a significant antitrust case heard by Judge Amit P. Mehta at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, where it stands accused by the Justice Department and several state attorneys general of illegally monopolizing the search and advertising markets. A decision in the case is expected sometime in 2024.

In today's final arguments, Google's defense hinged on three primary points: the rationale behind its business strategies, evidence of robust competition in the search market, and its positive influence on consumers and overall market competition.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand to justify the company's financial dealings with Apple (NASDAQ: ), explaining that paying for default search engine status on Apple devices was a strategic move meant to boost search usage and revenue. In 2021, Google invested a substantial $26.3 billion to secure its position as the default search engine across various platforms, dedicating $18 billion of that amount to Apple alone.

Addressing claims of monopolistic behavior, Google's legal team pointed to instances of competition within the search engine space. They highlighted Mozilla's temporary adoption of Yahoo as their default search engine in 2014, which ultimately reverted back following user feedback, as an example that other players have had opportunities to enter and compete in the market.

Prabhakar Raghavan, Google’s head of search, emphasized the company's hefty $40 billion investment in research and development over the past year. He stated that such investments have allowed Google to deliver superior technology and services to users. Furthermore, Google argued that its entrance into various markets has actually stimulated more competition rather than stifling it.

The case against Google has been closely watched as it touches on broader concerns about the power wielded by tech giants and their influence on consumer choices and market dynamics. As both sides await a verdict next year, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how digital markets are regulated and how tech companies operate globally.

2022-11-14, Investing.com,"Google antitrust trial mirrors Microsoft case, nearing conclusion",https://in.investing.com/news/google-antitrust-trial-mirrors-microsoft-case-nearing-conclusion-93CH-3901280,"The high-profile antitrust trial involving tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which commenced in September, is approaching its final stages, with expectations to conclude around Thanksgiving. The legal battle has seen Google defending itself against accusations that it has established an unassailable market position in the search engine sector, similar to the monopoly Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) held over PC software in the 1990s.

The prosecution, comprising the Justice Department along with several states, asserts that Google's dominance is built upon user-generated data, creating a significant barrier to entry for any would-be competitors. This narrative draws parallels to the antitrust case against Microsoft over two decades ago. In response, Google's defense attorney John Schmidtlein has emphasized the diminishing impact of data accumulation and credits Google's leading position to their substantial investment in human resources and software development.

Central to the case are Google's pay-for-default agreements with major technology companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ). These deals have been flagged by Judge Amit P. Mehta as the ""heart of the case,"" indicating their potential influence on the trial's outcome.

As the proceedings advanced into October, Schmidtlein sought to distinguish Google's circumstances from those of Microsoft by suggesting that barriers to competition in today's search market are less insurmountable than what was seen with personal computer software in the '90s. However, Judge Mehta dismissed this line of reasoning, maintaining his stance on using the Microsoft litigation as a benchmark for this trial.

With a verdict on the horizon, discussions around possible remedies have come into focus. Google maintains that it operates within a fair competitive landscape, while government officials are advocating for stringent sanctions to counteract the company's alleged anticompetitive practices.

The trial's outcome could have far-reaching implications for both Google and the broader technology industry, particularly concerning how digital markets and user data are regulated. As closing arguments near, all eyes are on Judge Mehta's decision and its potential to reshape the landscape of tech monopolies.

According to the filing, Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) accountants have raised “substantial doubt” about the platform’s future without help from that long delayed SPAC merger.

Truth Social was generally made available in the first quarter of 2022.

“The company prides itself on operating its platform, to the best of its ability, without relying on Big Tech companies. Partnering with pro-free-speech alternative technology firms, TMTG fully launched Truth Social for iOS in April 2022. TMTG debuted the Truth Social web application in May 2022, and the Truth Social Android App became available in the Samsung (KS: ) Galaxy and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play stores in October 2022,” according to the filing.

TMTG introduced direct messaging to all versions of Truth Social in 2022, released a “Groups” feature for users in May 2022, and announced the general availability of Truth Social internationally in June 2022.

Since its launch, Truth Social has experienced substantial growth, claimed the filing.

In September, Truth Social got a lifeline after Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company, that could infuse the social media platform with cash agreed to extend a critical deadline for a year.

Digital World shareholders agreed to extend the deadline again with about 72 per cent of shareholders voting to push the merger deadline until September 8, 2024, according to the company.

A merger would release to Trump Media $290 million held by Digital World and another $1 billion that private investors had committed to the combined company, PBS reported.

Trump’s company remains on its own, paying staff, leases and other expenses from $36 million raised from earlier sales of promissory notes, the report noted.

The initiative includes multiple bonuses aimed at attracting European users, as the company looks to fill the gap left by Binance's recent discontinuation of its Visa (NYSE: ) card services in the region.

Bybit's promotional efforts come on the heels of regulatory challenges that have seen competitors scale back their operations. Earlier in October, Binance opted to retire its Visa card in Europe, redirecting residents to its homepage instead of the Crypto Card portal. The decision was influenced by Binance's desire to concentrate on its primary business activities amidst a tightening regulatory landscape.

In contrast, Bybit is pressing forward with confidence, having launched its Mastercard service in March 2022. The card facilitates crypto-to-fiat transactions and is accepted at over 90 million merchants worldwide that support Mastercard. VIP members benefit from additional perks such as increased loyalty points and cashback rewards.

Bybit announced an incentive program specifically for European customers, featuring a 10 EUR signup bonus, a 5 EUR reward for the first transaction, and an additional 10 EUR for the first deposit made on the platform. This competitive strategy is indicative of Bybit’s commitment to growth in Europe. The firm is not deterred by the stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and due diligence requirements imposed by the EU's MiCA regulations earlier in July 2022.

While Binance has stepped back due to regulatory concerns and a challenging operational environment following new EEA regulations, Bybit is positioning itself as a viable alternative for European crypto investors. The exchange has also announced future plans to integrate its Mastercard service with mobile payment platforms Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, which will further extend its usability across various merchant locations that accept Mastercard.

Samsung has reportedly communicated to developers that its new MR headset will launch at the end of 2024.

The price of the Samsung headset is likely to be around $2,000, compared to $3,499 for the Apple Vision Pro.

The tool gives small online platforms access to a central database of content deemed to be created by terrorist organisations, reports The Wired.

The database, maintained by the UN-backed online counter-terrorism group Tech Against Terrorism, is already used by major tech companies.

“The tool aims to give smaller platforms the ability to easily and efficiently detect terrorist content on their networks and remove it,” the report noted.

The project is also working with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an industry-led group founded in 2017 by Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Twitter, and YouTube.

“Islamic State and other terrorist groups didn't give up on the Internet just because they no longer had the megaphone of their social media platforms. They went elsewhere,” Yasmin Green, CEO of Jigsaw, was quoted as saying in the report.

“They found this opportunity to host content on file-hosting sites or other websites, small and medium platforms,” Green added.

‘Altitude’ will also provide context about the terrorist groups the content is associated with.

Apple’s shipments declined by a modest 8 per cent, amounting to 17.2 million units.

The late arrival of the iPhone 15, compared to the timing of the iPhone 14, contributed to the decline.

Samsung (KS: )'s volume recovered slightly compared to Q2 2022 as it shipped 6.8 million units. Its new foldables boosted its performance, which accounted for over 20 per cent of its shipments.

Google (NASDAQ: ) Pixel captured 4 per cent market share, shipping 1.2 million units.

“The US smartphone market is stabilizing, but there is no expectation that Q4 will make a turnaround,” said Runar Bjorhovde, analyst at Canalys.

The iPhone 15 series had a strong start in September, accounting for 34 per cent of all iPhone sales in the US during Q3.

“The annual refresh of the iPhone portfolio remains paramount to all carriers, even to smaller challengers such as Boost Infinite, to attract switchers. However, fewer current users opt for upgrades to the latest models. Instead, there is a growing trend toward buying older generations, refurbished devices or keeping current phones longer,” explained analyst Le Xuan Chiew.

2022-11-10, IANS,Google 'offered' Netflix special deal to pay only 10% on Google Play,https://in.investing.com/news/google-offered-netflix-special-deal-to-pay-only-10-on-google-play-3896969,"San Francisco, Nov 10 (IANS) Not just Spotify, Google (NASDAQ: ) also offered streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) a special discounted rate of 10 per cent of its in-app payments on Android so that Netflix could keep 90 per cent of the money, the media reported.The details surfaced during the ongoing Epic Games vs. Google trial in the US, reports The Verge.

According to documents and testimonies in the courtroom, Google offered to make Netflix a “platform development partner” under a special programme, according to a Netflix internal document shown in court.

“Netflix is the only one this is being offered to at this point,” the document read.

“Bring revshare to 10 per cent on the condition that Netflix have a full commitment to GPB (Google Play Billing) globally,” according to the deal.

Netflix VP of business development Paul Perryman confirmed under oath that Google actually offered that deal to Netflix in September 2017, the report mentioned.

Netflix didn’t accept the deal, he said and no longer pays Google anything for distribution via Google Play.

Fortnite publisher Epic Games had sued Google in 2020 after a fight over in-app purchase fees. Google has defended its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

2022-11-10, IANS,Sundar Pichai to testify in Epic Games vs Google case next week,https://in.investing.com/news/sundar-pichai-to-testify-in-epic-games-vs-google-case-next-week-3896933,"San Francisco, Nov 10 (IANS) Alphabet and Google (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai is likely to testify in Epic Games’s lawsuit against Google in a US court next week. The Fortnite game developer seeks to call Pichai as a witness on Tuesday as it makes its case alleging that Google Play is an unlawful monopoly, reports The Verge.

“In court documents, Google requested to use a podium in the courtroom on Tuesday, which suggests that Pichai may indeed appear to testify,” the report noted.

Last month, in the US vs. Google case, Pichai stood behind a podium instead of sitting because of “apparent back issues”.

The lawsuit was filed after Google pulled Fortnite from the Play store.

Epic is arguing that Google's monopolistic control on its Google Play Store for Android smartphones violates both state and federal antitrust laws.

Meanwhile, Google offered a $147 million deal to game developer Epic Games to launch its popular game Fortnite on Google Play store, the tech giant told the court.

Purnima Kochikar, Vice President, Play Partnerships at Google, said in her testimony that the deal was approved and presented to Epic but not accepted, reports The Verge.

The deal would have seen the money dispensed over a three-year period of “incremental funding” (ending in 2021) to Epic.

In a document justifying the deal, Google wrote that “Fortnite’s absence could result in $130 million (up to $250 million) direct revenue loss with Play” and that there could be a “downstream impact of $550 million (up to $3.6 billion) potential revenue loss if broad contagion to other developers”.

The Epic vs Google trial began this week on Monday. Google has defended its 30 per cent cut on transactions for apps via its Play store.

The text field in the message box expands and moves to the middle of the screen when tapped, maximising space for text while still keeping the original email visible, the report mentioned.

Google was yet to officially comment on the feature. This appears to be a limited server-side test from Google.

The new message box under testing replaces buttons for Reply, Reply All, and Forward the email you received.

The new message box appears persistently at the bottom of the screen, and you don’t need to scroll to the bottom of an email to see it.

Just like a message writing field in an instant messaging app like Telegram or WhatsApp, one can use the chat-like box to reply to new emails.

One can also use the drop-down on the left side in the message box to change to Reply All, or edit the list of recipients.

On the right side, you get an expand button which brings up the full-screen message composition window you may be accustomed to.

It can be useful if you’re typing out a long message or replying in great detail, the report said.

“The reply setting drop-down and window expansion buttons also moves out of the way to maximize the room available for your text,” it added.

2022-11-09, Investing.com,Invesco QQQ Trust's heavy concentration in tech stocks raises volatility risk,https://in.investing.com/news/invesco-qqq-trusts-heavy-concentration-in-tech-stocks-raises-volatility-risk-93CH-3895076,"The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQ), an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) launched on March 10, 1999, and with net assets worth $195 billion, has been under scrutiny due to its high concentration in large tech stocks, which contributes to volatility risk and limits broad diversification.

It was noted that the fund's top ten holdings, including Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Broadcom (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) class A and B, Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Adobe (NASDAQ: ), account for about half of the fund's total assets. While the fund has a heavy concentration in tech stocks (57%), the Nasdaq-100 index it tracks is not purely a technology index but also includes sectors like consumer discretionary and healthcare. This structure may not cater to investors seeking a tech-focused or broadly diversified investment.

Despite its low expense ratio of 0.2% and an annualized return of 8.95%, the fund's concentration in large stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) (26% of assets) creates volatility risk and hinders broad diversification.

In terms of performance, as of the end of the first three quarters of 2022, its annualized return was 8.95%, nearly identical to the index's return of 9.17%. This suggests that although Invesco QQQ is efficient and performs its intended function well by closely tracking the Nasdaq-100 index, it may not provide the potential for significant growth beyond what investing directly in the Nasdaq-100 index would yield.

While beneficial for investors seeking to mirror the index's performance, this close alignment can be a double-edged sword. It may not offer substantial returns for those seeking significant growth, raising questions about whether this ETF is a suitable choice for all types of investors.

The feedback on recent SGE launches in the US, India and Japan has been positive, and people are finding generative AI particularly useful for complex questions they wouldn’t typically think to search.

“With SGE, we’re showing more links, and links to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered,” the company said in a statement.

Search Labs is a new way for people to test early-stage experiments on Search, available on the Google app (Android and iOS) and on Chrome desktop.

“Once you’re enrolled in Search Labs, just enable the SGE experiment to get started. In new countries, access via Chrome desktop is available today, and access through the Google app will be enabled over the coming week,” said Google.

The company is also experimenting with a new way for users to ask follow-up questions directly from the search results page.

As you continue to explore a topic, you can easily see your prior questions and search results, including Search ads in dedicated ad slots throughout the page.

Soon, if you ask Search to translate a phrase where certain words could have more than one possible meaning, you’ll see those terms underlined.

“Tap any of those words and you can indicate the specific meaning that reflects what you want to say. This option may also appear when you need to specify the gender for a particular word,” Google informed.

This AI-powered translation capability is coming soon to the US for English-to-Spanish translations, and “we plan to cover more countries and languages in the near future”.

On relevant searches, you’ll see certain words highlighted, so you can hover over them to preview their definition or view related images.

This update is rolling out over the next month, in English in the US, with more countries and languages expected to follow soon, said Google.

In September, the CFPB released a report highlighting how Apple and Google utilize their dominant position in the mobile phone market to promote their own digital wallets. Consumers transacted $893 billion through these services in 2020. While the adoption of digital payments in the U.S. has been slower compared to other countries, the pandemic has significantly accelerated its usage.

CEO Michael Saylor, in an interview with Fox Business, credited the company's Bitcoin holdings for this impressive growth. The company recently celebrated three years of Bitcoin purchasing by adding another 155 Bitcoins worth $5.3 million to its portfolio.

The firm now holds a total of 158,400 Bitcoins purchased at an average price of $29,586 per coin. In the third quarter alone, MicroStrategy bought 6,067 Bitcoins at an average cost of $27,531 each.

Among these tech giants, only Tesla holds Bitcoin according to its recent quarterly filings. Despite this, MicroStrategy has outperformed all these companies' returns.

The CEO encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy as a means of enhancing shareholder value by countering inflation, high-interest rates, and technology-driven deflation. This strategy involves incorporating Bitcoin into balance sheets to escape the costly cycle of acquisitions, stock buybacks, dividends, and debt.

2022-11-07, Investing.com,Alphabet contractors vote for unionization amid legal disputes,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-contractors-vote-for-unionization-amid-legal-disputes-93CH-3889276,"Contract staff at Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., responsible for enhancing Google's support pages, search engine results, and AI chatbot, have voted in favor of unionizing, according to a recent Monday election. The US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) confirmed that 26 out of 28 eligible employees supported the union. This decision may lead to a legal dispute over their employment status with Alphabet Inc.

These contract workers, technically employed by Accenture (NYSE: ) Plc, were involved in writing Google Help articles and developing the Bard AI chatbot. This significant development comes after what they claim were retaliatory layoffs in August. The union was initially announced by 118 Accenture workers in June, with the aim of seeking better assignments, improved pay, benefits, and paid time off.

In August, following the layoffs of 80 Accenture workers, the union lodged a complaint with the NLRB. They alleged that these layoffs were retaliatory and illegal. Google is currently appealing an NLRB ruling from September that it's a joint employer of Accenture contractors—an appeal that could shield Google from legal liability for the layoffs if successful.

Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini stated that Google doesn't object to Accenture workers unionizing and argued that Google isn't a joint employer as it doesn't control their employment terms or conditions. An Accenture spokesperson confirmed they will continue participating in the NLRB process and respect employees' right to form or join unions.

The contractors were recruited for what was referred to as a ""top secret project,"" which was later revealed to be Bard—a product designed by Google to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Workers were assigned to fact-check this large language model's prompt responses and engineer their own answers to theoretical prompts. When concerns about inadequate training or resources were raised, the work was reassigned to lower-paid workers based in Manila.

This is not the first instance of unionization efforts among Alphabet's contractors. In April, YouTube contractors employed by Cognizant (NASDAQ: ) also voted to unionize. However, Google decided to downsize its Cognizant workforce soon after. Three laid-off workers filed a complaint to the NLRB against Google and Cognizant, alleging their layoffs were in response to the unionization effort.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Google faces second major U.S. antitrust trial over Play Store monopoly allegations,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-second-major-us-antitrust-trial-over-play-store-monopoly-allegations-93CH-3888739,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google is embroiled in its second major antitrust trial in the United States, initiated by Fortnite creator Epic Games. The case, expected to conclude before Christmas, is centered around allegations of Google's monopolistic control over Android app distribution via its Play Store. The trial follows a similar lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) earlier this year, which resulted in apps being allowed to offer alternative payment options, potentially destabilizing tech giants' commission structures.

The proceedings kicked off with Epic Games accusing Google of creating an illegal monopoly on Android apps to boost profits through commissions on in-app purchases, which vary between 15% and 30%. Google's defense team countered the allegations, asserting that the company faces substantial competition from mobile and video game console stores, including Apple's app store.

Epic Games claims that Google employs a ""bribe and block"" strategy to discourage competition and complicate downloading Android apps from other outlets. Google defends these tactics as safety measures and justifies the commission system as necessary for maintaining an operating system powering billions of smartphones globally. The defense suggests that Epic aims to boost its profit by avoiding a payment system that diverts revenue from popular games like Fortnite.

The trial will feature testimonies from Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. Concurrently, the U.S. Justice Department is challenging Google's internet search dominance for alleged power abuse.

This legal challenge is part of Epic Games' ""Project Liberty"", an initiative aimed at app store transaction fees. The lawsuit follows Epic's 2021 case against Apple and accuses Google of using its control over Android and the Play Store to squeeze excessive profits from app developers.

Despite these allegations, Google recently settled antitrust claims with state attorneys general and Match Group (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Tinder. However, the Play Store continues to play a crucial role in services licensed to Android phone manufacturers and serves as a major entry point for Google's search engine.

Epic's lawsuits have drawn scrutiny from global regulators, notably in South Korea, home to Samsung Electronics (KS: ) - Google's largest mobile partner. In response to these concerns and as part of its efforts to appease large app developers such as Spotify (NYSE: ), Google has allowed alternative payment systems in the Play Store. Despite these changes and the popularity of Epic's Fortnite game on the platform, Alphabet reported a decline in Play Store revenue last year due to fee changes and decreased spending.

InvestingPro Insights

The firm explained that Naver said it will use Intel Sapphire Rapids and AI accelerators for its Naver Place AI (store and restaurant search/recommendation service) in the process of Inference.

However, Bernstein believes the move is not a game changer yet. ""By far, H100 of NVIDIA is the best performing AI chip in the world, ~1.5x-4.5x better than their previous generation (A100) on inference, and better on available inference tests against accelerators from Google, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), HabanaLabs,"" said the Wall Street firm.

""We still believe Switching GPU to CPU is not an ideal option because it is super costly for AI tasks, especially LLM model training. Despite the fact that NVIDIA H100 is much more expensive on chip basis, the total cost for training and inference is still lower regardless of its production and supply issue,"" the analysts added.



The firm said it does not believe Naver can replace its GPU-required LLM model training/tuning with the Intel CPU in the medium to long term.

""In conclusion, we think the collaboration between Naver and Intel is doable for very narrow use cases, or inference function only, or low enough parameters; but definitely not the game changer yet,"" argues Bernstein."

On the other hand, Motorola (NYSE: ) and Nokia (HE: ) HMD managed to buck the trend, witnessing shipment growth of 31% and 17% respectively. Despite robust promotions from carriers, upgrade rates hit near-record lows as consumers chose to retain their devices for longer periods.

However, new entrants in the market such as foldable smartphones are emerging as potential catalysts for a market rebound. Devices like Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, OnePlus's first foldable smartphone, and Motorola Razr 2022 are gaining traction among consumers, noted the analysts.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2022, a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates is expected. Counterpoint analysts predict that this rebound will be driven in part by a large base of iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users likely to switch to the iPhone 15 series. However, they anticipate that upgrade rates will remain lower than those of the previous year. All information was sourced from IANS.

2022-11-05, IANS,US smartphone shipments decline 19% in Q3 as users delay upgrade,https://in.investing.com/news/us-smartphone-shipments-decline-19-in-q3-as-users-delay-upgrade-3886202,"San Francisco, Nov 5 (IANS) The US smartphone shipments declined 19 per cent in Q3, as Samsung (KS: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and TCL saw steep declines of 26 per cent, 37 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively, in their shipments.Motorola and Nokia (HE: ) HMD managed to increase their shipments by 31 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, compared to the same period last year.

Apple’s shipments were down 11 per cent compared to Q3 2022, part of which is attributable to the later launch date of the iPhone 15 series compared to the iPhone 14 series, which pushed some shipments into Q4 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

“While upgrade rates were slightly up at the carriers when compared to last quarter, they remained much below their usual levels as consumers opted to hold on to their devices for longer instead of upgrading,” said research analyst Matthew Orf.

Foldables are a potential bright spot in the US smartphone market, with increasing number of Android foldables options.

“Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 5 in August, while OnePlus launched its first foldable and Motorola launched the sub-$900 Motorola Raz 2022 in early Q4 2022,” said senior research analyst Maurice Klaehne.

Despite the carriers continuing to offer strong promotions through the quarter, upgrade rates at the carriers remained near record lows.

“We expect a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates during the fourth quarter, but they are likely to remain lower than in the same period last year. There is a large installed base of iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users in the US that is likely to upgrade to the iPhone 15 series this year,” said research director Jeff Fieldhack.

2022-11-05, IANS,AI to bring high-quality and affordable healthcare to people: Google,https://in.investing.com/news/ai-to-bring-highquality-and-affordable-healthcare-to-people-google-3886024,"New Delhi, Nov 5 (IANS) The next generation of AI and large language models (LLMs) represents a dramatic shift in capability and promises to bring high-quality, affordable care and health to people around the world, with equity and inclusion, Google (NASDAQ: ) has stressed.Dr Karen DeSalvo, Chief Health Officer at Google, said that AI has the potential to transform the health of people on a planetary scale akin to the discovery of penicillin.

“If developed boldly and responsibly, AI stands to be a powerful force for health equity, improving outcomes for everyone, everywhere,” he said in a blog post.

Google is deploying AI in its products to help people in everyday moments.

""That might look like someone accessing mental health resources on Search, finding a match for a skin condition with Google Lens, getting useful health insights about irregular heart rhythms or powering our most accurate heart rate tracking on Fitbit,” said DeSalvo.

“We have teams moving our research from the bench to the bedside to democratize access to health across some of the world’s most critical diseases by applying AI to breast and colorectal cancer screening and chest X-ray imaging,” he informed.

As we think about how the next wave of AI will change health, it’s critical to keep these three approaches in mind: develop AI responsibly, collaborate with others and remember that AI is just one of many tools to improve health.

“If not developed and deployed responsibly, AI could amplify existing disparities. We are working to ensure that these technologies do not leave anyone behind and that the advancement of AI is harnessed in a bold and responsible way. All while partnering with the health ecosystem and the people it is serving,” said the Google executive.

2022-11-04, IANS,Google AdSense to move from pay-per-click to pay-per-impression model,https://in.investing.com/news/google-adsense-to-move-from-payperclick-to-payperimpression-model-3885677,"San Francisco, Nov 4 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) AdSense, the popular advertising platform, has announced that it will transition from pay-per-click to a pay-per-impression model, meaning publishers will get paid every time an ad is displayed.The company expects these updates to go into effect early next year, and these changes will not require any action from publishers.

""AdSense will soon transition from primarily paying publishers per click to the display industry standard of paying per impression,"" Google said in a blogpost.

""This update will provide a more uniform way for paying publishers for their ad space across Google’s products and third-party platforms, helping them compare with other technology providers they use,"" it added.

The tech giant also noted that this change will not influence the type or quantity of ads publishers can display on their websites.

Google also updated AdSense’s revenue-share structure to provide a consistent way for publishers to compare the differing fees across the various technologies they use to monetise.

Previously, the Google AdSense network processed fees within a single transaction. The company is now splitting the AdSense revenue share into separate rates for the buy-side and sell-side.

""For displaying ads with AdSense for content, publishers will receive 80 per cent of the revenue after the advertiser platform takes its fee, whether that be Google’s buy-side or third-party platforms,"" according to the company.

For instance, when Google Ads purchases display ads on AdSense, Google Ads will retain on average 15 per cent of advertiser spend.

There are variations because Google Ads does not take a fixed, per-impression fee, as many advertisers choose to pay based on user actions, like a click or conversion, the company explained.

Overall, publishers will continue to keep about 68 per cent of the revenue. When advertisers use a third-party platform to purchase display ads on AdSense, publishers will keep 80 per cent of the revenue after the third-party platform has taken its fee.

Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade. However, it's clear that other FAANG stocks also hold strong potential for sustained growth.

Lendlease said in a statement that both companies agreed to end the deal after determining that ""the existing agreements are no longer mutually beneficial given current market conditions.""

The four master-planned districts are in San Jose (Downtown West), Sunnyvale (Moffett Park), and Mountain View (Middlefield Park and North Bayshore) in the San Francisco Bay area in California, collectively referred to as the San Francisco Bay Project.

The development could have totalled over 15 million square feet of ""office, residential, retail and other space.""

Google and Lendlease agreed to the original $15 billion deal in 2019 and planned to spend 10 to 15 years redeveloping Google’s land across locations.

However, the pandemic significantly changed business real estate needs after companies shifted toward hybrid work. Google's senior director of development Alexa Arena said that the company is looking at ""a variety of options"" to meet its housing commitment.

""We’ve been optimising our real estate investments in the Bay Area, and part of that work is looking at a variety of options to move our development projects forward and deliver on our housing commitment. We appreciate Lendlease and the work the team has done to get us to this point,"" Arena added.

As part of the decision to end these agreements, Lendlease will receive a payment in consideration for value created through the entitlement and master planning process. Lendlease will remove the San Francisco Bay Project, which was expected to commence construction in FY26, from its development pipeline.

Despite this development, Google remains steadfast in its commitment to these projects. The tech giant's Senior Director of Development, Alexa Arena, confirmed that the company plans to continue with other developers and financial backers.

The dissolution of the partnership also impacts the Downtown West neighborhood in San Jose, a significant part of Google's comprehensive real estate review.

The new rule would affect companies that process over five million financial transactions annually, which currently includes approximately 17 firms.

The CFPB's director, Rohit Chopra, has been advocating for increased regulatory scrutiny of large technology companies due to potential concerns related to ""surveillance and censorship."" He views these payment systems as a crucial component of the economy.

In September, the CFPB released a report highlighting how Apple and Google utilize their dominant position in the mobile phone market to promote their own digital wallets. Consumers transacted $893 billion through these services in 2020. While the adoption of digital payments in the U.S. has been slower compared to other countries, the pandemic has significantly accelerated its usage.

Currently, the CFPB's jurisdiction over electronic fund transfers gives it enforcement powers over digital payment companies. However, the proposed rule would bolster its supervisory oversight, providing a more detailed insight into the operations of major market participants.

CEO Michael Saylor, in an interview with Fox Business, credited the company's Bitcoin holdings for this impressive growth. The company recently celebrated three years of Bitcoin purchasing by adding another 155 Bitcoins worth $5.3 million to its portfolio.

The firm now holds a total of 158,400 Bitcoins purchased at an average price of $29,586 per coin. In the third quarter alone, MicroStrategy bought 6,067 Bitcoins at an average cost of $27,531 each. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $35,000 after seeing a 70% increase in value throughout 2022.

Saylor also highlighted the ""Magnificent Seven"" - Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) - which have contributed to nearly 13% of the 's strong performance this year. Among these tech giants, only Tesla holds Bitcoin according to its recent quarterly filings. Despite this, MicroStrategy has outperformed all these companies' returns.

The CEO encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy as a means of enhancing shareholder value by countering inflation, high-interest rates, and technology-driven deflation. This strategy involves incorporating Bitcoin into balance sheets to escape the costly cycle of acquisitions, stock buybacks, dividends, and debt.

Saylor expressed optimism about Bitcoin's future growth due to the upcoming 2024 halving and potential demand surge from spot ETFs.

2022-11-07, Investing.com,Alphabet contractors vote for unionization amid legal disputes,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-contractors-vote-for-unionization-amid-legal-disputes-93CH-3889276,"Contract staff at Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., responsible for enhancing Google's support pages, search engine results, and AI chatbot, have voted in favor of unionizing, according to a recent Monday election. The US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) confirmed that 26 out of 28 eligible employees supported the union. This decision may lead to a legal dispute over their employment status with Alphabet Inc.

These contract workers, technically employed by Accenture (NYSE: ) Plc, were involved in writing Google Help articles and developing the Bard AI chatbot. This significant development comes after what they claim were retaliatory layoffs in August. The union was initially announced by 118 Accenture workers in June, with the aim of seeking better assignments, improved pay, benefits, and paid time off.

In August, following the layoffs of 80 Accenture workers, the union lodged a complaint with the NLRB. They alleged that these layoffs were retaliatory and illegal. Google is currently appealing an NLRB ruling from September that it's a joint employer of Accenture contractors—an appeal that could shield Google from legal liability for the layoffs if successful.

Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini stated that Google doesn't object to Accenture workers unionizing and argued that Google isn't a joint employer as it doesn't control their employment terms or conditions. An Accenture spokesperson confirmed they will continue participating in the NLRB process and respect employees' right to form or join unions.

The contractors were recruited for what was referred to as a ""top secret project,"" which was later revealed to be Bard—a product designed by Google to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Workers were assigned to fact-check this large language model's prompt responses and engineer their own answers to theoretical prompts. When concerns about inadequate training or resources were raised, the work was reassigned to lower-paid workers based in Manila.

This is not the first instance of unionization efforts among Alphabet's contractors. In April, YouTube contractors employed by Cognizant (NASDAQ: ) also voted to unionize. However, Google decided to downsize its Cognizant workforce soon after. Three laid-off workers filed a complaint to the NLRB against Google and Cognizant, alleging their layoffs were in response to the unionization effort.

2022-11-06, Investing.com,Google faces second major U.S. antitrust trial over Play Store monopoly allegations,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-second-major-us-antitrust-trial-over-play-store-monopoly-allegations-93CH-3888739,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google is embroiled in its second major antitrust trial in the United States, initiated by Fortnite creator Epic Games. The case, expected to conclude before Christmas, is centered around allegations of Google's monopolistic control over Android app distribution via its Play Store. The trial follows a similar lawsuit against Apple (NASDAQ: ) earlier this year, which resulted in apps being allowed to offer alternative payment options, potentially destabilizing tech giants' commission structures.

The proceedings kicked off with Epic Games accusing Google of creating an illegal monopoly on Android apps to boost profits through commissions on in-app purchases, which vary between 15% and 30%. Google's defense team countered the allegations, asserting that the company faces substantial competition from mobile and video game console stores, including Apple's app store.

Epic Games claims that Google employs a ""bribe and block"" strategy to discourage competition and complicate downloading Android apps from other outlets. Google defends these tactics as safety measures and justifies the commission system as necessary for maintaining an operating system powering billions of smartphones globally. The defense suggests that Epic aims to boost its profit by avoiding a payment system that diverts revenue from popular games like Fortnite.

The trial will feature testimonies from Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company. Concurrently, the U.S. Justice Department is challenging Google's internet search dominance for alleged power abuse.

This legal challenge is part of Epic Games' ""Project Liberty"", an initiative aimed at app store transaction fees. The lawsuit follows Epic's 2021 case against Apple and accuses Google of using its control over Android and the Play Store to squeeze excessive profits from app developers.

Despite these allegations, Google recently settled antitrust claims with state attorneys general and Match Group (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Tinder. However, the Play Store continues to play a crucial role in services licensed to Android phone manufacturers and serves as a major entry point for Google's search engine.

Epic's lawsuits have drawn scrutiny from global regulators, notably in South Korea, home to Samsung Electronics (KS: ) - Google's largest mobile partner. In response to these concerns and as part of its efforts to appease large app developers such as Spotify (NYSE: ), Google has allowed alternative payment systems in the Play Store. Despite these changes and the popularity of Epic's Fortnite game on the platform, Alphabet reported a decline in Play Store revenue last year due to fee changes and decreased spending.

InvestingPro Insights

(GOOGL) continues to yield high returns on invested capital and holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, according to InvestingPro Tips.

The firm explained that Naver said it will use Intel Sapphire Rapids and AI accelerators for its Naver Place AI (store and restaurant search/recommendation service) in the process of Inference.

However, Bernstein believes the move is not a game changer yet. ""By far, H100 of NVIDIA is the best performing AI chip in the world, ~1.5x-4.5x better than their previous generation (A100) on inference, and better on available inference tests against accelerators from Google, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), HabanaLabs,"" said the Wall Street firm.

""We still believe Switching GPU to CPU is not an ideal option because it is super costly for AI tasks, especially LLM model training. Despite the fact that NVIDIA H100 is much more expensive on chip basis, the total cost for training and inference is still lower regardless of its production and supply issue,"" the analysts added.



The firm said it does not believe Naver can replace its GPU-required LLM model training/tuning with the Intel CPU in the medium to long term.

""In conclusion, we think the collaboration between Naver and Intel is doable for very narrow use cases, or inference function only, or low enough parameters; but definitely not the game changer yet,"" argues Bernstein."

Apple’s shipments were down 11 per cent compared to Q3 2022, part of which is attributable to the later launch date of the iPhone 15 series compared to the iPhone 14 series, which pushed some shipments into Q4 2022, according to Counterpoint Research.

“While upgrade rates were slightly up at the carriers when compared to last quarter, they remained much below their usual levels as consumers opted to hold on to their devices for longer instead of upgrading,” said research analyst Matthew Orf.

Foldables are a potential bright spot in the US smartphone market, with increasing number of Android foldables options.

“Samsung launched its Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 5 in August, while OnePlus launched its first foldable and Motorola launched the sub-$900 Motorola Raz 2022 in early Q4 2022,” said senior research analyst Maurice Klaehne.

Despite the carriers continuing to offer strong promotions through the quarter, upgrade rates at the carriers remained near record lows.

“We expect a seasonal rebound in upgrade rates during the fourth quarter, but they are likely to remain lower than in the same period last year. There is a large installed base of iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users in the US that is likely to upgrade to the iPhone 15 series this year,” said research director Jeff Fieldhack.

“If developed boldly and responsibly, AI stands to be a powerful force for health equity, improving outcomes for everyone, everywhere,” he said in a blog post.

Google is deploying AI in its products to help people in everyday moments.

""That might look like someone accessing mental health resources on Search, finding a match for a skin condition with Google Lens, getting useful health insights about irregular heart rhythms or powering our most accurate heart rate tracking on Fitbit,” said DeSalvo.

“We have teams moving our research from the bench to the bedside to democratize access to health across some of the world’s most critical diseases by applying AI to breast and colorectal cancer screening and chest X-ray imaging,” he informed.

As we think about how the next wave of AI will change health, it’s critical to keep these three approaches in mind: develop AI responsibly, collaborate with others and remember that AI is just one of many tools to improve health.

“If not developed and deployed responsibly, AI could amplify existing disparities. We are working to ensure that these technologies do not leave anyone behind and that the advancement of AI is harnessed in a bold and responsible way. All while partnering with the health ecosystem and the people it is serving,” said the Google executive.

2022-11-04, IANS,Google AdSense to move from pay-per-click to pay-per-impression model,https://in.investing.com/news/google-adsense-to-move-from-payperclick-to-payperimpression-model-3885677,"San Francisco, Nov 4 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) AdSense, the popular advertising platform, has announced that it will transition from pay-per-click to a pay-per-impression model, meaning publishers will get paid every time an ad is displayed.The company expects these updates to go into effect early next year, and these changes will not require any action from publishers.

""AdSense will soon transition from primarily paying publishers per click to the display industry standard of paying per impression,"" Google said in a blogpost.

""This update will provide a more uniform way for paying publishers for their ad space across Google’s products and third-party platforms, helping them compare with other technology providers they use,"" it added.

The tech giant also noted that this change will not influence the type or quantity of ads publishers can display on their websites.

Google also updated AdSense’s revenue-share structure to provide a consistent way for publishers to compare the differing fees across the various technologies they use to monetise.

Previously, the Google AdSense network processed fees within a single transaction. The company is now splitting the AdSense revenue share into separate rates for the buy-side and sell-side.

""For displaying ads with AdSense for content, publishers will receive 80 per cent of the revenue after the advertiser platform takes its fee, whether that be Google’s buy-side or third-party platforms,"" according to the company.

For instance, when Google Ads purchases display ads on AdSense, Google Ads will retain on average 15 per cent of advertiser spend.

There are variations because Google Ads does not take a fixed, per-impression fee, as many advertisers choose to pay based on user actions, like a click or conversion, the company explained.

Overall, publishers will continue to keep about 68 per cent of the revenue. When advertisers use a third-party platform to purchase display ads on AdSense, publishers will keep 80 per cent of the revenue after the third-party platform has taken its fee.

Among them, Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, has been the standout performer with its shares soaring more than 155%. This substantial increase is largely attributed to strong quarterly updates.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth. While all FAANG stocks have performed impressively this year, with Apple recording nearly a 40% increase in year-to-date returns despite being the least performer among them, Meta seems poised to lead in the next decade. However, it's clear that other FAANG stocks also hold strong potential for sustained growth.

Lendlease said in a statement that both companies agreed to end the deal after determining that ""the existing agreements are no longer mutually beneficial given current market conditions.""

The four master-planned districts are in San Jose (Downtown West), Sunnyvale (Moffett Park), and Mountain View (Middlefield Park and North Bayshore) in the San Francisco Bay area in California, collectively referred to as the San Francisco Bay Project.

The development could have totalled over 15 million square feet of ""office, residential, retail and other space.""

Google and Lendlease agreed to the original $15 billion deal in 2019 and planned to spend 10 to 15 years redeveloping Google’s land across locations.

However, the pandemic significantly changed business real estate needs after companies shifted toward hybrid work. Google's senior director of development Alexa Arena said that the company is looking at ""a variety of options"" to meet its housing commitment.

""We’ve been optimising our real estate investments in the Bay Area, and part of that work is looking at a variety of options to move our development projects forward and deliver on our housing commitment. We appreciate Lendlease and the work the team has done to get us to this point,"" Arena added.

As part of the decision to end these agreements, Lendlease will receive a payment in consideration for value created through the entitlement and master planning process. Lendlease will remove the San Francisco Bay Project, which was expected to commence construction in FY26, from its development pipeline.

Despite this positive momentum, Alphabet's stock price remained $12.12 below its annual high of $141.22, which was attained on October 12th.

The trading volume for Alphabet was documented at 26.1 million shares, indicating a shortfall against its average trading volume. This suggests that while the stock is experiencing growth, it may not be attracting the same level of investor interest as usual.

The decision affects projects in San Jose, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View, which were set to cover over 15 million sq ft of diverse and usable spaces.

Despite this development, Google remains steadfast in its commitment to these projects. The tech giant's Senior Director of Development, Alexa Arena, confirmed that the company plans to continue with other developers and financial backers.

The dissolution of the partnership also impacts the Downtown West neighborhood in San Jose, a significant part of Google's comprehensive real estate review. However, the company reassures its commitment to housing projects in the Bay Area. This commitment was echoed by Mayor Matt Mahan of San Jose, who highlighted Google's dedication to an 80-acre mega project in his city.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a decrease in demand for office space among tech companies. Yet, Google's Downtown West campus is anticipated to aid San Jose's economic recovery.

Google's intention to build a large mixed-use neighborhood in downtown San Jose was further reinforced by Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer with Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), at a recent community event. The presence of Alphabet's top executive serves as a signal of the company's continued commitment.

As part of its ongoing collaboration with local governments, Google is undertaking a $750 million rezoning effort aimed at constructing at least 15,000 homes. Prior to ending their partnership, Google and Lendlease had facilitated the construction of up to 12,900 units in Mountain View and San Jose.

The planned transit village in Downtown West is expected to house up to 20,000 Google employees. It will include 7.3 million square feet of offices, 4,000 residential units, 500,000 square feet of retail space, 300 hotel rooms, and 15 acres of open space.

2022-11-03, Investing.com,YouTube tightens content recommendations for teen safety,https://in.investing.com/news/youtube-tightens-content-recommendations-for-teen-safety-93CH-3883409,"In a bid to enhance child safety online, YouTube is executing updates to its content recommendation algorithm, primarily aimed at teenage users. The move comes in the wake of criticisms against social media platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram's parent company, Meta, for profiting from children's distress and spreading misinformation about platform safety.

The updates, announced via a blog post last Thursday, are designed to reduce harmful video suggestions that glorify certain body weights or display social aggression such as ""non-contact fights"" and intimidation. YouTube has faced backlash over its content management practices, with critics arguing its video recommendation engine could lead young users towards damaging content.

James Beser, director of youth and kids product at YouTube, and an advisory committee identified these potentially harmful content categories. They have now curbed the repetition of such content for U.S teenagers and plan to extend these changes globally within the next year.

Allison Briscoe-Smith from the Youth and Family Advisory Committee highlighted the importance of these ""guardrails"" in assisting teens to form healthy self-images. Jennifer Kelman, a JustAnswer Therapist on YouTube's Advisory Board of wellness experts, also stressed the need for time restrictions and protective measures to shield young users from constant exposure to harmful content.

Despite YouTube's efforts to improve its safety measures and parental controls, a Pew Research Center survey reveals that an estimated 95% of teens are actively engaged with the platform. This indicates the significant influence YouTube has on this demographic and underscores the importance of these new safety measures.

The tech giant recorded a revenue of $76.69 billion and a net income of $19.7 billion, with earnings per share at $1.55. This marks a return to double-digit growth for Alphabet after four quarters of single-digit growth.

Despite the overall positive performance, Alphabet's stock value saw a decline due to underperforming cloud revenue. The company's cloud business performance contrasted with the positive results from competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

In the realm of advertising, Alphabet also reported an increase in revenue to $59.65 billion, up from last year's $54.48 billion. However, this fell short of analyst expectations due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and increased competition from TikTok.

In an effort to gain an edge in the competitive tech market, Alphabet has invested $2 billion in AI startup Antropic. This follows Amazon's previous investment of $4 billion in the same company, indicating an intensifying competition in the AI sector among these tech giants. Antropic's AI model Claude 2 is expected to surpass large language models like ChatGPT developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.

Products in Search sold by businesses with that attribute will have a “small business” label on them, as will businesses on Maps, said the company.

“These new labels will make it easier for shoppers to narrow down their searches and be intentional about shopping with their favourite,” Google said late on Wednesday.

The company is rolling out Product Studio -- a set of AI tools to help merchants create and manage product imagery -- to all Merchant Center Next users in the U.S.

“That includes our experimental AI-powered scene generation feature, which uses a text-to-image generative AI model to help you place products into any creative scene you dream up,” Google noted.

Product Studio will share a few prompt ideas, including holiday-themed scenes, to spark inspiration.

It’s easy to tweak or reuse prompts that worked well for you in the past. You can also remove distracting backgrounds or improve resolution on your product images in one click.

Starting this month in select countries, the knowledge panel that appears on certain retailer searches -- which previously showed details like the location of a business’ headquarters or the number of employees -- will start showing other helpful shopping information, like current deals, shipping and return policies, customer service information and ratings and reviews.

Importantly, the research indicated that AI companies have trained their bots to give far more credence to information published by those credible publishers versus material elsewhere across the web, the report said.

“The research and analysis we’ve conducted show that AI companies and developers are not only engaging in unauthorised copying of our members’ content to train their products, but they are using it pervasively and to a greater extent than other sources,” Danielle Coffey, Chief Executive of the News Media Alliance, said in a statement, CNN reported.

“This shows they recognise our unique value, and yet most of these developers are not obtaining proper permissions through licensing agreements or compensating publishers for the use of this content,” Coffey added.

“This diminishment of high-quality, human created content harms not only publishers but the sustainability of AI models themselves and the availability of reliable, trustworthy information.”

In the published white paper, the trade group also rejected arguments that AI bots have simply “learned” facts by reading various sets of data, like a human being would.

The group said “it is inaccurate” to form such a conclusion “because models retain the expressions of facts that are contained in works in their copied training materials (and which copyright protects) without ever absorbing any underlying concepts”, CNN reported.

An increasing number of YouTube users are now seeing a warning, asking them to turn off ad blockers and watch ads or pay $14 for a YouTube Premium subscription, according to Android Authority.

Over the past several weeks, more users with ad blockers installed have found themselves unable to watch YouTube videos.

Now, the company has launched a global effort to encourage users to allow ads or try YouTube Premium (which includes YouTube Music).

A company spokesperson told The Verge that the ""use of ad blockers"" violates the platform’s terms of service. ""Ads support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favourite content on YouTube,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

YouTube in June confirmed that it was disabling videos for users with ad blockers. At that time, it was only a ""small experiment globally"". YouTube introduced unskippable 30-second ads to its TV app in May and later began experimenting with longer but less frequent ad breaks on TV, too.

Last month, the streaming platform announced to end its lower-cost subscription plan 'Premium Lite', after piloting it for two years in select countries.

The company announced to no longer offer 'Premium Lite' after October 25.

YouTube's 'Premium Lite' plan, which costs $7.39 per month was first introduced in select European countries in 2021, and offered ad-free viewing across YouTube's spectrum of apps and formats.

However, it did not include Premium's other features such as offline downloads, background playback, or any YouTube Music benefits. The removal came after YouTube Premium raised its individual plan prices for the first time, with the plan now starting at $13.99 per month. Meanwhile, family plans were increased to $22.99 per month late last year.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Google CEO defends against antitrust charges, cites competition and user choice",https://in.investing.com/news/google-ceo-defends-against-antitrust-charges-cites-competition-and-user-choice-93CH-3875522,"Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), on Tuesday defended Google against allegations of antitrust practices brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), emphasizing the company's competition with rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and evolving online behaviors. Despite Google's 90% market share, Pichai argued that the company faces significant competition and has always prioritized user choice.

The DOJ alleges that Google stifled potential competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and DuckDuckGo by paying $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various devices. This figure includes a substantial payment between $4 billion and $8 billion to Apple, a result of the iPhone's significant market share.

During the renegotiation of a contract with Apple in 2016, Pichai expressed concerns about ""query cannibalisation,"" a situation where Apple could potentially redirect Safari queries to other platforms. He underscored that Google developed Chrome and Android to enhance web access and promote Google's search, thereby bringing hundreds of millions of users online. Other companies, including Microsoft with its Edge browser, can use Chrome's underlying technology and Android for free.

The government questioned why Google needs to pay billions for default status if its product is superior. They implied that Google uses its prime position to extract more from advertisers. Pichai had previously expressed concerns about being the default and favored offering a choice, as indicated in 2007 internal emails.

In Monday's testimony, Pichai discussed Google's strategies to maintain its dominance in online search. The government alleges that Google locked out rivals via exclusive deals with phone manufacturers and web browser-makers. During his cross-examination, Pichai confirmed that while Google does not prohibit choice screens, for those agreeing to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA), providing a choice screen would not align with the agreement.

Pichai also addressed concerns about employee turnover, requesting monthly reports of losses to competitors, especially Apple. The DOJ criticized Google's policy of not automatically retaining internal chat messages, alleging that Google systematically destroyed instant message chats through its history-off option.

A decision on the case is expected next year.

During the US Justice Department’s hearing late on Monday, Pichai said that Google Search, Android and Chrome are not only good products, but are good for the Internet as a whole, reports The Verge.

“People use Android to build smartphones at prices as low as $30, and it’s what has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,” said Pichai.

Google spent around $26.3 billion in 2021 to remain the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones and platforms.

The figure came out during the US Justice Department’s cross-examination of Google’s search head, Prabhakar Raghavan, last week.

At the beginning of Pichai’s testimony, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein had him walk through his life and work history, from growing up in India to running one of the largest companies on the planet. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and Schmidtlein asked why he believed in the company.

“I saw the potential. I realised for the first time the internet would touch most of humanity and it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Pichai said.

When the lawyers asked about Google’s deal with Apple, Pichai said that “we wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a long-term deal, the concept of default was preserved in a consistent way.”

Google was worried at the time that Apple might make a deal with, say, Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“Google also worried about Apple’s new Suggestions feature in Safari, which would help users navigate directly for some queries rather than sending everyone to Google’s results page,” according to the report.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

Furthermore, Oracle's trading volume for the session was noted at 5.4 million, significantly lower than its average trading volume over the past 50 days, suggesting a decrease in market activity for the company.

2022-11-03, Investing.com,YouTube tightens content recommendations for teen safety,https://in.investing.com/news/youtube-tightens-content-recommendations-for-teen-safety-93CH-3883409,"In a bid to enhance child safety online, YouTube is executing updates to its content recommendation algorithm, primarily aimed at teenage users. The move comes in the wake of criticisms against social media platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram's parent company, Meta, for profiting from children's distress and spreading misinformation about platform safety.

The updates, announced via a blog post last Thursday, are designed to reduce harmful video suggestions that glorify certain body weights or display social aggression such as ""non-contact fights"" and intimidation. YouTube has faced backlash over its content management practices, with critics arguing its video recommendation engine could lead young users towards damaging content.

James Beser, director of youth and kids product at YouTube, and an advisory committee identified these potentially harmful content categories. They have now curbed the repetition of such content for U.S teenagers and plan to extend these changes globally within the next year.

Allison Briscoe-Smith from the Youth and Family Advisory Committee highlighted the importance of these ""guardrails"" in assisting teens to form healthy self-images. Jennifer Kelman, a JustAnswer Therapist on YouTube's Advisory Board of wellness experts, also stressed the need for time restrictions and protective measures to shield young users from constant exposure to harmful content.

Despite YouTube's efforts to improve its safety measures and parental controls, a Pew Research Center survey reveals that an estimated 95% of teens are actively engaged with the platform. This indicates the significant influence YouTube has on this demographic and underscores the importance of these new safety measures.

The tech giant recorded a revenue of $76.69 billion and a net income of $19.7 billion, with earnings per share at $1.55. This marks a return to double-digit growth for Alphabet after four quarters of single-digit growth.

Despite the overall positive performance, Alphabet's stock value saw a decline due to underperforming cloud revenue. The company's cloud business performance contrasted with the positive results from competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

In the realm of advertising, Alphabet also reported an increase in revenue to $59.65 billion, up from last year's $54.48 billion. However, this fell short of analyst expectations due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and increased competition from TikTok.

In an effort to gain an edge in the competitive tech market, Alphabet has invested $2 billion in AI startup Antropic. This follows Amazon's previous investment of $4 billion in the same company, indicating an intensifying competition in the AI sector among these tech giants. Antropic's AI model Claude 2 is expected to surpass large language models like ChatGPT developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI.

InvestingPro Insights

According to InvestingPro, Alphabet Inc. holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and yields a high return on invested capital. These InvestingPro Tips suggest a strong financial position for the company, which may provide a cushion against the underperformance of its cloud business.

Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) represents a significant expansion opportunity in the gaming industry, while Alphabet's ongoing development of the AI model Gemini is seen as a direct competitor to Microsoft's ChatGPT.

Microsoft's broad business model includes AI features incorporated into its Office suite and investments in OpenAI. These initiatives are projected to generate $10 billion annually from AI. The company's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard offers a substantial growth opportunity within the gaming sector.

On the other hand, Alphabet primarily relies on Google Search and YouTube for its revenue, which generated an impressive $59.6 billion last quarter, surpassing Microsoft's total revenue. The company is currently developing an AI model, Gemini, aiming to compete with Microsoft's ChatGPT. Alphabet's focus on enhancing YouTube and Google with AI could potentially offer more long-term value for growth investors.

Despite their success, both companies are facing antitrust lawsuits from the U.S government. Google maintains an 84% market share on desktops, even under scrutiny for its search dominance.

While Microsoft trades at a higher earnings multiple due to its AI advancements and diverse business model, Alphabet's concentrated efforts on enhancing YouTube and Google with AI could provide more long-term value for growth investors.

Products in Search sold by businesses with that attribute will have a “small business” label on them, as will businesses on Maps, said the company.

“These new labels will make it easier for shoppers to narrow down their searches and be intentional about shopping with their favourite,” Google said late on Wednesday.

The company is rolling out Product Studio -- a set of AI tools to help merchants create and manage product imagery -- to all Merchant Center Next users in the U.S.

“That includes our experimental AI-powered scene generation feature, which uses a text-to-image generative AI model to help you place products into any creative scene you dream up,” Google noted.

Product Studio will share a few prompt ideas, including holiday-themed scenes, to spark inspiration.

It’s easy to tweak or reuse prompts that worked well for you in the past. You can also remove distracting backgrounds or improve resolution on your product images in one click.

Starting this month in select countries, the knowledge panel that appears on certain retailer searches -- which previously showed details like the location of a business’ headquarters or the number of employees -- will start showing other helpful shopping information, like current deals, shipping and return policies, customer service information and ratings and reviews.

Importantly, the research indicated that AI companies have trained their bots to give far more credence to information published by those credible publishers versus material elsewhere across the web, the report said.

“The research and analysis we’ve conducted show that AI companies and developers are not only engaging in unauthorised copying of our members’ content to train their products, but they are using it pervasively and to a greater extent than other sources,” Danielle Coffey, Chief Executive of the News Media Alliance, said in a statement, CNN reported.

“This shows they recognise our unique value, and yet most of these developers are not obtaining proper permissions through licensing agreements or compensating publishers for the use of this content,” Coffey added.

“This diminishment of high-quality, human created content harms not only publishers but the sustainability of AI models themselves and the availability of reliable, trustworthy information.”

In the published white paper, the trade group also rejected arguments that AI bots have simply “learned” facts by reading various sets of data, like a human being would.

The group said “it is inaccurate” to form such a conclusion “because models retain the expressions of facts that are contained in works in their copied training materials (and which copyright protects) without ever absorbing any underlying concepts”, CNN reported.

An increasing number of YouTube users are now seeing a warning, asking them to turn off ad blockers and watch ads or pay $14 for a YouTube Premium subscription, according to Android Authority.

Over the past several weeks, more users with ad blockers installed have found themselves unable to watch YouTube videos.

Now, the company has launched a global effort to encourage users to allow ads or try YouTube Premium (which includes YouTube Music).

A company spokesperson told The Verge that the ""use of ad blockers"" violates the platform’s terms of service. ""Ads support a diverse ecosystem of creators globally and allow billions to access their favourite content on YouTube,"" the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

YouTube in June confirmed that it was disabling videos for users with ad blockers. At that time, it was only a ""small experiment globally"". YouTube introduced unskippable 30-second ads to its TV app in May and later began experimenting with longer but less frequent ad breaks on TV, too.

Last month, the streaming platform announced to end its lower-cost subscription plan 'Premium Lite', after piloting it for two years in select countries.

The company announced to no longer offer 'Premium Lite' after October 25.

YouTube's 'Premium Lite' plan, which costs $7.39 per month was first introduced in select European countries in 2021, and offered ad-free viewing across YouTube's spectrum of apps and formats.

However, it did not include Premium's other features such as offline downloads, background playback, or any YouTube Music benefits. The removal came after YouTube Premium raised its individual plan prices for the first time, with the plan now starting at $13.99 per month. Meanwhile, family plans were increased to $22.99 per month late last year.

2022-10-31, Investing.com,"Google CEO defends against antitrust charges, cites competition and user choice",https://in.investing.com/news/google-ceo-defends-against-antitrust-charges-cites-competition-and-user-choice-93CH-3875522,"Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), on Tuesday defended Google against allegations of antitrust practices brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), emphasizing the company's competition with rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and evolving online behaviors. Despite Google's 90% market share, Pichai argued that the company faces significant competition and has always prioritized user choice.

The DOJ alleges that Google stifled potential competitors like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and DuckDuckGo by paying $26 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various devices. This figure includes a substantial payment between $4 billion and $8 billion to Apple, a result of the iPhone's significant market share.

During the renegotiation of a contract with Apple in 2016, Pichai expressed concerns about ""query cannibalisation,"" a situation where Apple could potentially redirect Safari queries to other platforms. He underscored that Google developed Chrome and Android to enhance web access and promote Google's search, thereby bringing hundreds of millions of users online. Other companies, including Microsoft with its Edge browser, can use Chrome's underlying technology and Android for free.

The government questioned why Google needs to pay billions for default status if its product is superior. They implied that Google uses its prime position to extract more from advertisers. Pichai had previously expressed concerns about being the default and favored offering a choice, as indicated in 2007 internal emails.

In Monday's testimony, Pichai discussed Google's strategies to maintain its dominance in online search. The government alleges that Google locked out rivals via exclusive deals with phone manufacturers and web browser-makers. During his cross-examination, Pichai confirmed that while Google does not prohibit choice screens, for those agreeing to the Revenue Sharing Agreement (RSA), providing a choice screen would not align with the agreement.

Pichai also addressed concerns about employee turnover, requesting monthly reports of losses to competitors, especially Apple. The DOJ criticized Google's policy of not automatically retaining internal chat messages, alleging that Google systematically destroyed instant message chats through its history-off option.

A decision on the case is expected next year.

During the US Justice Department’s hearing late on Monday, Pichai said that Google Search, Android and Chrome are not only good products, but are good for the Internet as a whole, reports The Verge.

“People use Android to build smartphones at prices as low as $30, and it’s what has helped bring hundreds of millions of people online,” said Pichai.

Google spent around $26.3 billion in 2021 to remain the default search engine in multiple browsers, phones and platforms.

The figure came out during the US Justice Department’s cross-examination of Google’s search head, Prabhakar Raghavan, last week.

At the beginning of Pichai’s testimony, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein had him walk through his life and work history, from growing up in India to running one of the largest companies on the planet. Pichai joined Google in 2004, and Schmidtlein asked why he believed in the company.

“I saw the potential. I realised for the first time the internet would touch most of humanity and it was a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” Pichai said.

When the lawyers asked about Google’s deal with Apple, Pichai said that “we wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a long-term deal, the concept of default was preserved in a consistent way.”

Google was worried at the time that Apple might make a deal with, say, Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“Google also worried about Apple’s new Suggestions feature in Safari, which would help users navigate directly for some queries rather than sending everyone to Google’s results page,” according to the report.

In its latest quarterly earnings report, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday said came in at $0.94 per share, flattening the $0.58 estimate, on $143.1 billion in revenue vs. the $141.53B consensus.

Cloud unit Amazon Web Services sales climbed 12% to $23.1B, slightly missing estimates of $23.2B, although it also indicated that growth there was stabilizing.

The company expects total sales of $160B to $167B next quarter, under the average Street target of $167.2B.

""Overall this was a strong print & in-line with our retail margin thesis,"" said Piper Sandler, which cut the price target by $15 to $170 per share.

Citi hiked the price target by $10 to $177, citing a combination of ""attractive valuation"" and ""a structurally more profitable business.""

""We believe AWS is well positioned to deliver accelerating growth as optimization headwinds abate as Amazon gains consumer wallet share given the mix-shift to essentials, while expanding margins,"" analysts said.

At the same time, Reuters reported that the company warned that discretionary spending was weaker, saying in a call with reporters that they ""still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals.""

Shares gained some 2% for the week to $127.74.

Microsoft comes in strong

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said late Tuesday that fiscal totaled $2.99 per share on sales of $56.52B, comfortably surpassing estimates for $2.65 and $54.53B, respectively.

The company also said sales for its Azure cloud business grew 29% year over year, nicely above Wall Street estimates for a 26% climb. And on the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood said Q2 revenue should be around $60.9B (up or down $500 million), in line with the guidance.

Microsoft's investments in AI - including its famous $10B bet on OpenAI, which created the popular AI tool ChatGPT - are expected to continue to drive growth: Wedbush said it believes over half of Microsoft's installed base ""will ultimately use the AI functionality for the enterprise/commercial landscape,"" representing ""a major monetization opportunity"" that is already playing out.

Citi, meanwhile, said the report ""checked all the boxes"" and believes the results indicate ""demand trends are stabilizing (or accelerating) and should offer a positive read on the outlook.""

And Goldman Sachs expects earnings growth acceleration triggered by heightened gross margin leverage in fiscal 2025, raising Microsoft's price target by $50 to $450.

Shares lifted some 1% for the week to $329.81.

Alphabet weaker under the hood

On the flip side, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) shares took a big hit after the Google parent reported top- and bottom-line beats but also said cloud revenue rose just 22% to $8.4B, short of expectations for $8.6 billion, and slightly lower-than-expected operating income of $21.34B.

Bernstein said that both popular bull cases for GOOGL - ""cloud taking share offering further AI re-rating"" and ""visible"" expansion in margins - ""suddenly... feel very distant.""

The analysts added, ""Top-line tracking well, but margin contraction and a soft cloud print weighs heavily on the question 'why buy Google here?'""

Several Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on GOOGL stock in response to the Q3 earnings report.

GOOGL shares plummeted about 10% for the week, closing Friday at $122.17.

Meta tops targets but indicates soft ad demand in current quarter

Meta (NASDAQ: ) reported better-than-expected and stronger guidance for the current quarter as cost cuts boosted margins, but shares lost ground after the earnings call, when management reported softening brand advertising demand at the beginning of Q4.

""While we don't have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook,"" CFO Susan Li said on the call.

In terms of overall earnings and revenue, Meta reported adjusted EPS of $4.39 - smashing the $3.64 average target - on a top line of $34.15B vs. analysts' expectation for $33.57B.

Total costs and expenses were $20.40 billion, down 7% from the prior year, boosting the company's operating margin to 40% in Q3 from 20% a year earlier.

Looking ahead, the company said it expects third quarter revenue to be in the range of $36.5B to $40B, a range that's mostly above the anticipated $38.84B.

Oppenheimer reiterated its bullish view on Meta on ""3Q's continued revenue outperformance and cost control, despite conservative low end of 4Q guide on Middle East.""

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) continues to ""see META as well-positioned against several long-term secular growth themes and are encouraged by the positive momentum across key product initiatives incl. Reels, click-to-messaging Ads and AI including Advantage+ adoption.""

Shares were off some 4% for the week to $296.73.

Intel's rosy forecast

Intel (NASDAQ: ), amid signs PC demand has bottomed, delivered better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter as well as adjusted of $0.41 - nearly double the $0.22 target - on better-than-anticipated sales of $14.2B.

Q4 adjusted EPS is expected at $0.44 on revenue of between $14.6B and $15.6B, says the company, well ahead of estimates for EPS of $0.33 on revenue of $14.36B.

HSBC upgraded the stock's rating to Hold from Reduce on the news, with a price target of $33, citing expectations for ""significant earnings revisions from better execution and improving PC outlook to lead to a re-rating.""

Bernstein boosted the price target to $36 on the ""quite strong"" results, writing, ""Overall the company does appear to have turned the corner on the worst of it, and (perhaps) a PC-dominated narrative might be enough to carry it for the moment.""

Shares gained nearly 2% for the week to $35.54.

2022-10-29, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3872677,"Investing.com -- It’s going to be a very busy week for investors, with a Federal Reserve meeting, the latest U.S. jobs report and earnings from technology heavyweight Apple that could set the direction for stocks and bonds the rest of the year. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Federal Reserve meeting

Investors will be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s on Wednesday, eager to hear policymakers' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.

Most investors are betting that the Fed is done tightening after Chair Jerome Powell said that rising long-term yields reduce the need for further rate increases, though some believe another hike could come when the central bank meets again in December.

Any indications that the Fed intends to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the .

The index has fallen more than 10% since hitting a year-high in late July, though is still up nearly 8% on the year.

Nonfarm payrolls data

The key piece of economic data this week will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are expecting more moderate jobs growth of , which is still consistent with a robust labor market.

The unemployment rate is expected to remain at , while wage growth is expected to ease to year-on-year, which would mark a post-pandemic period low. This could help bolster the Fed’s view that price pressures are easing and that it doesn't need to raise interest rates any further.

Ahead of Friday’s data, market participants will be looking at data on third-quarter employment costs on Tuesday for signs that wage growth is moderating.

Earnings

Apple (NASDAQ: ) tops the bill in what is set to be another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting on Thursday.

Shares of Apple, the largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year along with shares of other megacap U.S. tech and growth companies.

Third quarter earnings season has seen disappointments from some Big Tech names, with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) slumping after their respective reports. The tech-heavy is down 11% from its high, though still up nearly 30% on the year.

Consumers' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include McDonald's (NYSE: ) on Monday, Caterpillar (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ) on Tuesday, Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) on Thursday.

Bank of England

The Bank of England is to hold its penultimate of the year on Thursday, where officials will need to decide whether to resume raising interest rates, having kept them on hold in September after 14 hikes in a row.

Investors are expecting the BoE to keep rates on hold at a 15-year high of 5.25%, while leaving the door open to further hikes if necessary. Policymakers are also expected to reiterate that rates will need to remain around current levels for quite some time to come despite growing signs that the economy is flat-lining.

The BoE will update its quarterly forecasts which in August showed economic growth of just 0.5% in both 2022 and 2024. Governor Andrew Bailey spoke earlier this month of a ""very subdued"" outlook.

Eurozone inflation and GDP

The European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold on Thursday after the steepest pace of rate hikes on record and will now be looking ahead to Tuesday’s data on inflation and gross domestic product ahead of its final meeting of the year.

Preliminary data on consumer price inflation is expected to show the headline rate slowing to in October, coming closer to the ECB’s 2% target, even if high energy costs continue to pose an upside risk.

GDP data the same day is expected to show that the Eurozone economy contracted by in the third quarter, for an annual rate of growth of just .

On Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde hinted at steady policy ahead and pushed back against rate cut expectations.

2022-10-29, IANS,Indian-origin man convicted in Singapore for fatally hitting fellow traveller,https://in.investing.com/news/indianorigin-man-convicted-in-singapore-for-fatally-hitting-fellow-traveller-3872583,"Singapore, Oct 29 (IANS) A court in Singapore has convicted a 33-year-old Indian-origin man for hitting another man to death following an altercation while they were travelling in a taxi in July, 2020.Sakthivel Sivasurian was convicted on Friday of one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to Manjunatha Louis Ravi, who fell and died in hospital five days later from neck and head injuries, The Straits Times newspaper reported.

According to court documents, Manjunatha, a woman, Sakthivel and Sakthivel's wife were in a taxi on the way to Gangsa Road at around 11 p.m. when a dispute arose between the attacker and the victim.

During the altercation, Manjunatha fell and hit his head on the ground, and was unable to get up on his own.

He was taken to a hospital where a scan revealed bleeding on the surface of his brain, along with brain swelling and a suggestion of brain damage.

An autopsy showed that Manjunatha had a small crack in the bone above his left eye, and a displacement in his spine, The Times reported.

In a trial that lasted 16 days, the defence told the court that the initial injury Manjunatha had from the fall was not fatal. Instead, it was when Sakthivel tried to pick him up and dropped him that the initial injury was aggravated and resulted in his death.

Sakthivel claimed that after Manjunatha was hit, he took several steps backwards while still facing Sakthivel before stepping on uneven ground and falling.

District Judge James Elisha Lee accepted the evidence from Sakthivel's lawyer that Manjunatha had been dropped twice when Sakthivel and a woman were trying to lift him after he had fallen to the ground.

But he expressed reasonable doubt whether Manjunatha would have died from the initial injury from the fall had he not been ""dropped and manhandled"".

""While the dropping and manhandling of the victim after the fall may have aggravated his initial injury, the situation had arisen purely as a result of the fall. If not for the fall, and the victim's inability to get up on his own thereafter, (the two of them) would not have attempted to lift or move him,"" Judge Lee was quoted as saying in The Straits Times.

""In fact, if not for the (injury) sustained by the victim from the fall, the dropping and manhandling of the victim per se would not have resulted in his death.""

Sakthivel also submitted a Google (NASDAQ: ) Street View image from October 2019 to support his position that there was already a hole on the ground where the incident occurred.

The judge said none of the eyewitnesses had seen the victim losing his footing after stepping on uneven ground.

In addition, he said that based on the manner in which Manjunatha took his steps, as seen in video footage, and the extremely short time between when he was hit and when he fell, it was clear that he had fallen to the ground as a result of having been hit.

""Even if the victim had fallen after stepping into the hole, it would still have been attributable to the hit by the accused,"" the judge said.

Sakthivel will return to court in November for sentencing.

2022-10-28, IANS,Social media platforms wage war against growing pro-Hamas content,https://in.investing.com/news/social-media-platforms-wage-war-against-growing-prohamas-content-3872296,"New Delhi, Oct 28 (IANS) As pro-Hamas accounts flooded various social media platforms amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, governments took cognisance of the delicate situation and warned Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), X (formerly Twitter), Telegram and others to either fix their content moderation algorithms or face actionIsrael-based social threat intelligence firm Cyabra found that from over 162,000 profiles engaged in conversations about Hamas’s attacks, 25 per cent -- more than 40,000 profiles -- were fake.

Those fake profiles disseminated over 312,000 pro-Hamas posts and comments, with some of the accounts publishing hundreds of posts per day, on major social media platforms.

During the first week of the conflict (October 7-14), US-based for-profit organisation NewsGuard analysed the 250 most-engaged posts (likes, reposts, replies, and bookmarks) that promoted one of 10 prominent false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war.

It found that verified users with Blue badges are the ones spreading the vast majority of misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war on X.

The results revealed that 186 out of these 250 posts -- 74 per cent -- were posted by accounts verified by X.

“Nearly three-fourths of the most viral posts on X advancing misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war are being pushed by ‘verified' X accounts,” according to the analysis.

The European Commission formally opened an investigation into X over alleged spreading of illegal content and disinformation, in particular the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate speech in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. The Commission sent a formal notice to X under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the platform is ""coordinating with industry peers to respond to terrorist content being distributed online"" and ""taking action to remove content and bad actors that violate our policies"".

She stated that the company is actively working with partners, governments, regulators and policymakers to combat misinformation.

Earlier, EU commissioner Thierry Breton had warned Elon Musk, saying that his X platform “is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU” after the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel.

Responding to the EU's request, Yaccarino said that the microblogging platform has removed hundreds of ""Hamas-linked accounts"" and ""taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content"" since the attack on Israel.

Commissioner Breton also wrote to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, telling him to remove pro-Hamas content across his platforms and “be very vigilant” else it could put the company in violation of new EU regulations.

In a letter to Zuckerberg, Breton urged Meta to remove illegal terrorist content and hate speech amid the ongoing war in Israel.

He said that the European Commission had seen “a surge of illegal content and disinformation being disseminated in the EU.”

“I urgently invite you to ensure that your systems are effective. Needless to say, I also expect you to be in contact with the relevant law enforcement authorities and Europol, and ensure that you respond promptly to any requests,” he noted.

In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company has created a “special operations center with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers” after the Hamas attacks on Israel and curbed the spread of misinformation about the war on its platforms.

“Content containing praise for Hamas, which is designated by Meta as a Dangerous Organisation, or violent and graphic content, for example, is not allowed on our platforms. We can make errors and that is why we offer an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it,” it said last week.

In the three days following October 7, Meta removed or marked as disturbing more than 795,000 pieces of content for violating these policies in Hebrew and Arabic.

Another social media platform Telegram had to block channels used by Hamas, but only on Android phones owing to violations of Google’s app store guidelines.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the official Telegram channels of Hamas and the al-Qassam Brigades became “inaccessible for Telegram users who downloaded the app through the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store”.

Telegram responded to the block, saying “Some of the channels you are following may stop being accessible in your version of Telegram because of Google Play’s guidelines.”

Telegram has allegedly served as one of the central platforms for Hamas, its supporters, and other Palestinian terrorist groups to publish statements and propaganda, according to the report.

Chinese short-video-making app TikTok also said that the platform removed over 500,000 videos and closed 8,000 livestreams to date since the attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas for violating the company's guidelines.

2022-10-28, IANS,Google to invest $2 bn in OpenAI's rival AI company Anthropic: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-invest-2-bn-in-openais-rival-ai-company-anthropic-report-3872278,"San Francisco, Oct 28 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly investing $2 billion in AI startup company Anthropic, founded by former members of Microsoft-backed OpenAI, as the AI race heats up.The funding deal involves $500 million now and up to $1.5 billion later, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Google was yet to comment on the development.

In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10 per cent stake.

In September, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said it will invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic with a minority ownership position in the company, as competition grows in the growing generative AI market ruled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with US Vice President Kamala Harris, along with Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and OpenAI.

Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS.

As of July 2022, Anthropic had raised $1.5 billion in funding.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former senior members of OpenAI, principally Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.

If you can tell the response won’t be useful, a blue “Skip response” button appears, reports 9to5Google.

You can switch between the “Respond in real time” and “Respond when complete” options. Bing Chat, Microsoft’s AI chatbot, also responds in real time.

Google (NASDAQ: ) also lets you modify the response to become more “casual” or “professional”.

You can also double-check any answers against the information in Search by hitting the Google logo in the bottom menu bar.

Bard previously sent a response when it was complete after your prompt.

Now, you can get a glimpse at your answer as it’s being generated by Google AI.

This real-time setting launched in recent days, and does not appear in Google’s Bard Updates changelog, according to the report.

Google’s AI chatbot can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels.

“We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web,” according to Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Earlier this month, Google announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI.

It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalised help.

One can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, “you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices,” Pichai informed.

The $26.3 billion amount was made public after a debate between the tech company and Judge Amit Mehta over “whether the figure should be redacted”.

“Mehta has begun to push for more openness in the trial in general, and this was one of the most significant new pieces of information to be shared openly,” the report mentioned late on Friday.

In its latest quarterly earnings report this week, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

The company's entire ad business -- which also includes YouTube ads -- made a bit under $90 billion in profit in the last year.

It means that Google is giving up about 16 per cent of its search revenue and about 29 per cent of its profit to those distribution deals, the report mentioned.

The New York Times recently reported that Google’s deal to be the default search engine in Apple (NASDAQ: ) Safari across Google products cost the company about $18 billion in 2021.

Meanwhile, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to testify in the US vs Google anti-trust case on October 30, sharing his side of the story on how Google’s search is successful owing to its own innovation and not deals with the big companies.

Pichai will testify in the ongoing antitrust trial in the suit brought by the US Justice Department and a coalition of state attorneys general.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Alphabet shares record third straight loss amid tough market conditions,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-shares-record-third-straight-loss-amid-tough-market-conditions-93CH-3872000,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. has marked its third consecutive loss in a challenging stock market environment on Friday, with its shares closing at $122.17, a drop of $19.05 from its 52-week high achieved on October 12th, 2022. This downward trend contrasts with the rising share prices of competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

The trading volume for Alphabet was notably high, with 43.7 million shares changing hands, significantly above its 50-day average of 27.5 million shares. This surge in trading activity underscores the intensity of the recent market dynamics.

The performance of Alphabet's stock is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the stock market and the performance of its peers. The company's peak value date, consecutive losses, competitors' performance, trading volumes and the overall stock market environment are key factors to consider in understanding Alphabet's current position in the market.

While Alphabet has been experiencing a downtrend, competitors Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have seen their share prices rise. This divergence in performance highlights the competitive dynamics currently at play in the tech sector.

The date of Alphabet's peak value on October 12th and the subsequent consecutive losses are significant indicators of the company's recent stock performance. However, it remains to be seen how these trends will evolve in light of the overall stock market environment and the performance of Alphabet's competitors.

We believe this will incentivise research around AI safety and security, and bring potential issues to light that will ultimately make AI safer for everyone,"" Google said in a blogpost on Thursday.

The company issued updated guidelines outlining which findings will be eligible for rewards and which are not.

For instance, discovering training data extraction that discloses private, sensitive information is within scope, but if it just shows public, nonsensitive data, it does not qualify for a reward.

Last year, the tech giant issued over $12 million in rewards to security researchers who tested their products for vulnerabilities.

In addition, Google said it is expanding its open-source security work and building upon its prior collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, to further protect against machine learning supply chain attacks.

Earlier this month, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) announced an AI bug bounty programme featuring the AI-powered Bing experience as the first in-scope product, with awards up to $15,000.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,"Amazon,  PCE data, Bank of Japan - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon--pce-data-bank-of-japan--whats-moving-markets-3870339,"Investing.com -- Amazon shines with its third-quarter earnings, helping push Wall Street into a positive close to the week. The Fed's favorite gauge is due later in the session, while crude prices gain on elevated Middle East tensions. Next week's Bank of Japan meeting also looms large.

1. Amazon shines in third quarter

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) was the latest of the major tech companies to report third-quarter results, and the e-commerce giant topped expectations as growth in its cloud business continued to stabilize and advertising growth jumped.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud business segment, grew revenue 12% to $23.1 billion, while advertising revenue jumped 26% to $12.06 billion from a year earlier.

""[O]ur AWS growth continued to stabilize, our advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow rose significantly,” said CEO Andy Jassy.

The company has sought to bolster its cloud presence, taking on major rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), with a deal to invest up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic, and has also reorganized its delivery network, letting it fulfill orders faster than before, and more cheaply.

Its stock jumped more than 5% premarket, with the results released after the close Thursday, even while warning that consumers remained wary about spending going into the holiday quarter.

""We still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals,"" said CFO Brian Olsavsky.

2. Futures higher, helped by strong Amazon numbers

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, ending a difficult week on a positive note after strong earnings from e-commerce giant Amazon.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 107 points or 0.3%, rose by 25 points or 0.6%, and rose by 138 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, with the tech-heavy shedding 1.8%, on course for weekly losses of about 3% and on pace for its third straight losing week.

The broad-based closed 1.2% lower, off 2% on the week, while the blue chip dropped 0.8%, its sixth negative session in seven, set for a weekly loss of 1%.

However, the tone has turned Friday following the release of strong numbers from Amazon [see above].

More earnings are due from oil giants Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) before the opening bell, as well as from consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: ).

3. Fed’s favorite inflation gauge due

The U.S. is seen as a near certainty to pause on further interest rate hikes at its meeting next week, but Thursday's unexpectedly strong reading on third quarter has created an element of doubt over December’s meeting.

This means Friday's report on inflation in the form of the will carry extra significance, given the reading of which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.

Analysts expect the September headline reading to rise 3.4% for the year and 0.3% for the month, while the core PCE, which strips out fuel and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.7% for the year and 0.3% for the month.

Fed Chair was at pains to point out last week that above-trend economic growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""

With the GDP data surprising to the upside, any indications that inflation is starting to grow again could change the narrative surrounding further Fed decisions.

4. BOJ meeting looms large

Next week sees central bank policy-setting meetings in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. While the Fed gathering always attracts the most attention, it may well be officials that have the most to discuss.

The Japanese central bank will face growing pressure to shift further away from its controversial bond yield control, amid rising global bond yields and persistent inflation.

The BOJ has been laying the groundwork for an eventual end to negative interest rates, but this meeting is expected to be too early for such a move with BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda warning of the fallout from slowing global growth.

That said, rose 3.3% on the year in October, remaining persistently above the central bank’s 2% target, while the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has seen the yen trade above 150 against the U.S. dollar, near the three-decade low of 151.94 that prompted government intervention a year ago.

A weak yen tends to boost imported food and fuel prices.

5. Crude rises on U.S. strikes on Syria

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

By 04:45 ET, the futures traded 2% higher at $84.89 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2% to $89.70 a barrel.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far."

The and declined over 0.76% and 1% respectively, reflecting investor concerns over an anticipated economic slowdown.

In the midst of these market fluctuations, tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) fell short of impressing investors, despite exceeding revenue and earnings targets. Meta Platforms, in particular, suffered a 3.7% stock drop after warning of ""volatility"" in the ad market. This news came as a surprise to many investors, given the company's recent surge in quarterly profit.

The market also responded poorly to Alphabet and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), amplifying investor unease. Toymakers Hasbro (NASDAQ: ) and Mattel (NASDAQ: ) saw their shares fall, while drugmaker Merck (NS: ) and IBM (NYSE: ) experienced gains.

Commodity prices followed suit with the stock market trend, with West Texas Intermediate and both decreasing by 2.3%. also slipped by 1.6%, and the fell by 10.6 basis points.

Despite the strong Q3 GDP growth, Wall Street's reaction underscores the complex interplay between economic indicators and investor sentiment.

“He testified about the emphasis Google places on R&D and innovation, disputing the notion that Google’s search product is higher quality in countries other than the US where it faces increased competition,” the X account further posted.

Raghavan also testified that Google faces intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

He disagreed with the Department of Justice’s standpoint of Google as a “one-stop shop” because he thinks it’s not how users think about their searches.

When asked about a 1998 article about Yahoo!'s dominance of search, Raghavan said he was aware rivals from Expedia.com to Instagram to TikTok competed for users' attention.

""I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill,"" said Raghavan who reports to Pichai. Raghavan is a Senior Vice President at Google, responsible for Google Search, Assistant, Geo, Ads, Commerce and Payments products.

Amandeep Singh, the Secretary-General’s envoy on technology and an under-secretary-general, will lead the panel.

As a member of the Indian Foreign Service, Gill was the permanent representative to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.

Giving an example of “the incredible possibilities – and the potential dangers – of AI”, Guterres said that an AI app gave him “the surreal experience of watching myself deliver a speech in flawless Chinese, despite the fact that I do not speak Chinese and the lips movement corresponded exactly to what I was saying”.

“Without entering into a host of doomsday scenarios, it is already clear that the malicious use of AI could undermine trust in institutions, weaken social cohesion, and threaten democracy itself,"" he said.

At the same time, “in our challenging times, AI could power extraordinary progress for humanity”, the UN chief noted.

“The transformative potential of AI for good is difficult even to grasp,"" Guterres said.

The Secretary-General added that he has charged the panel with reporting by the end of the year on three areas: the international governance of artificial intelligence; a shared understanding of risks and challenges, and using it to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals that cover the gamut from agriculture; and education to health and justice.

Gill said that the panel ""will bring together expertise from around the world from different disciplines, latest expertise on the direction of the technology and its impact on our societies, on our economies and on our politics”.

“The body will look at what is being done today in response to these emerging challenges and what is missing, what are the gaps and how the existing efforts can be better networked together so that we have a more effective governance response.""

Guterres cast a wide net for talent to be on the panel, which includes government officials and religious leaders, academics and activists, and business figures from technology companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) and Sony, drawn from every continent.

Sharad Sharma, co-founder iSPIRT Foundation, and Nazneen Rajani, lead researcher at Hugging Face, from India are on the panel.

Amazon beats - and warns

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday said came in at $0.94 per share, flattening the $0.58 estimate, on $143.1 billion in revenue vs. the $141.53B consensus.

Cloud unit Amazon Web Services sales climbed 12% to $23.1B, slightly missing estimates of $23.2B, although it also indicated that growth there was stabilizing.

The company expects total sales of $160B to $167B next quarter, under the average Street target of $167.2B.

""Overall this was a strong print & in-line with our retail margin thesis,"" said Piper Sandler, which cut the price target by $15 to $170 per share.

Citi hiked the price target by $10 to $177, citing a combination of ""attractive valuation"" and ""a structurally more profitable business.""

""We believe AWS is well positioned to deliver accelerating growth as optimization headwinds abate as Amazon gains consumer wallet share given the mix-shift to essentials, while expanding margins,"" analysts said.

At the same time, Reuters reported that the company warned that discretionary spending was weaker, saying in a call with reporters that they ""still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals.""

Shares gained some 2% for the week to $127.74.

Microsoft comes in strong

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said late Tuesday that fiscal totaled $2.99 per share on sales of $56.52B, comfortably surpassing estimates for $2.65 and $54.53B, respectively.

The company also said sales for its Azure cloud business grew 29% year over year, nicely above Wall Street estimates for a 26% climb. And on the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood said Q2 revenue should be around $60.9B (up or down $500 million), in line with the guidance.

Microsoft's investments in AI - including its famous $10B bet on OpenAI, which created the popular AI tool ChatGPT - are expected to continue to drive growth: Wedbush said it believes over half of Microsoft's installed base ""will ultimately use the AI functionality for the enterprise/commercial landscape,"" representing ""a major monetization opportunity"" that is already playing out.

Citi, meanwhile, said the report ""checked all the boxes"" and believes the results indicate ""demand trends are stabilizing (or accelerating) and should offer a positive read on the outlook.""

And Goldman Sachs expects earnings growth acceleration triggered by heightened gross margin leverage in fiscal 2025, raising Microsoft's price target by $50 to $450.

Shares lifted some 1% for the week to $329.81.

Alphabet weaker under the hood

On the flip side, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) shares took a big hit after the Google parent reported top- and bottom-line beats but also said cloud revenue rose just 22% to $8.4B, short of expectations for $8.6 billion, and slightly lower-than-expected operating income of $21.34B.

The management attributed the disappointing cloud sales to client optimization.

Bernstein said that both popular bull cases for GOOGL - ""cloud taking share offering further AI re-rating"" and ""visible"" expansion in margins - ""suddenly... feel very distant.""

The analysts added, ""Top-line tracking well, but margin contraction and a soft cloud print weighs heavily on the question 'why buy Google here?'""

Several Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on GOOGL stock in response to the Q3 earnings report.

GOOGL shares plummeted about 10% for the week, closing Friday at $122.17.

Meta tops targets but indicates soft ad demand in current quarter

Meta (NASDAQ: ) reported better-than-expected and stronger guidance for the current quarter as cost cuts boosted margins, but shares lost ground after the earnings call, when management reported softening brand advertising demand at the beginning of Q4.

""While we don't have material direct revenue exposure to Israel and the Middle East, we have observed softer ad spend in the beginning of the fourth quarter, correlating with the start of the conflict, which is captured in our Q4 revenue outlook,"" CFO Susan Li said on the call.

In terms of overall earnings and revenue, Meta reported adjusted EPS of $4.39 - smashing the $3.64 average target - on a top line of $34.15B vs. analysts' expectation for $33.57B.

Total costs and expenses were $20.40 billion, down 7% from the prior year, boosting the company's operating margin to 40% in Q3 from 20% a year earlier.

Looking ahead, the company said it expects third quarter revenue to be in the range of $36.5B to $40B, a range that's mostly above the anticipated $38.84B.

2022-10-29, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3872677,"Investing.com -- It’s going to be a very busy week for investors, with a Federal Reserve meeting, the latest U.S. jobs report and earnings from technology heavyweight Apple that could set the direction for stocks and bonds the rest of the year. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Federal Reserve meeting

Investors will be turning their attention to the Federal Reserve’s on Wednesday, eager to hear policymakers' views on the state of the economy and the outlook for interest rates.

Most investors are betting that the Fed is done tightening after Chair Jerome Powell said that rising long-term yields reduce the need for further rate increases, though some believe another hike could come when the central bank meets again in December.

Any indications that the Fed intends to keep rates around current levels through next year could bolster bets on further upside in Treasury yields, whose climb to their highest levels in more 15 years has contributed to a sharp sell-off in the .

The index has fallen more than 10% since hitting a year-high in late July, though is still up nearly 8% on the year.

Nonfarm payrolls data

The key piece of economic data this week will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report for October. After a blockbuster 336,000 jobs were added in September, economists are expecting more moderate jobs growth of , which is still consistent with a robust labor market.

The unemployment rate is expected to remain at , while wage growth is expected to ease to year-on-year, which would mark a post-pandemic period low. This could help bolster the Fed’s view that price pressures are easing and that it doesn't need to raise interest rates any further.

Ahead of Friday’s data, market participants will be looking at data on third-quarter employment costs on Tuesday for signs that wage growth is moderating.

Earnings

Apple (NASDAQ: ) tops the bill in what is set to be another busy week of U.S. corporate earnings, with the iPhone maker reporting on Thursday.

Shares of Apple, the largest company by market value, have helped drive equity indexes higher this year along with shares of other megacap U.S. tech and growth companies.

Third quarter earnings season has seen disappointments from some Big Tech names, with shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) slumping after their respective reports. The tech-heavy is down 11% from its high, though still up nearly 30% on the year.

Consumers' spending habits will also be in the spotlight with other companies set to report include McDonald's (NYSE: ) on Monday, Caterpillar (NYSE: ) and Pfizer (NYSE: ) on Tuesday, Mondelez (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday, and Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) on Thursday.

Bank of England

The Bank of England is to hold its penultimate of the year on Thursday, where officials will need to decide whether to resume raising interest rates, having kept them on hold in September after 14 hikes in a row.

Investors are expecting the BoE to keep rates on hold at a 15-year high of 5.25%, while leaving the door open to further hikes if necessary. Policymakers are also expected to reiterate that rates will need to remain around current levels for quite some time to come despite growing signs that the economy is flat-lining.

The BoE will update its quarterly forecasts which in August showed economic growth of just 0.5% in both 2022 and 2024. Governor Andrew Bailey spoke earlier this month of a ""very subdued"" outlook.

Eurozone inflation and GDP

The European Central Bank kept interest rates on hold on Thursday after the steepest pace of rate hikes on record and will now be looking ahead to Tuesday’s data on inflation and gross domestic product ahead of its final meeting of the year.

Preliminary data on consumer price inflation is expected to show the headline rate slowing to in October, coming closer to the ECB’s 2% target, even if high energy costs continue to pose an upside risk.

GDP data the same day is expected to show that the Eurozone economy contracted by in the third quarter, for an annual rate of growth of just .

On Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde hinted at steady policy ahead and pushed back against rate cut expectations.

2022-10-29, IANS,Indian-origin man convicted in Singapore for fatally hitting fellow traveller,https://in.investing.com/news/indianorigin-man-convicted-in-singapore-for-fatally-hitting-fellow-traveller-3872583,"Singapore, Oct 29 (IANS) A court in Singapore has convicted a 33-year-old Indian-origin man for hitting another man to death following an altercation while they were travelling in a taxi in July, 2020.Sakthivel Sivasurian was convicted on Friday of one charge of voluntarily causing hurt to Manjunatha Louis Ravi, who fell and died in hospital five days later from neck and head injuries, The Straits Times newspaper reported.

According to court documents, Manjunatha, a woman, Sakthivel and Sakthivel's wife were in a taxi on the way to Gangsa Road at around 11 p.m. when a dispute arose between the attacker and the victim.

During the altercation, Manjunatha fell and hit his head on the ground, and was unable to get up on his own.

He was taken to a hospital where a scan revealed bleeding on the surface of his brain, along with brain swelling and a suggestion of brain damage.

An autopsy showed that Manjunatha had a small crack in the bone above his left eye, and a displacement in his spine, The Times reported.

In a trial that lasted 16 days, the defence told the court that the initial injury Manjunatha had from the fall was not fatal. Instead, it was when Sakthivel tried to pick him up and dropped him that the initial injury was aggravated and resulted in his death.

Sakthivel claimed that after Manjunatha was hit, he took several steps backwards while still facing Sakthivel before stepping on uneven ground and falling.

District Judge James Elisha Lee accepted the evidence from Sakthivel's lawyer that Manjunatha had been dropped twice when Sakthivel and a woman were trying to lift him after he had fallen to the ground.

But he expressed reasonable doubt whether Manjunatha would have died from the initial injury from the fall had he not been ""dropped and manhandled"".

""While the dropping and manhandling of the victim after the fall may have aggravated his initial injury, the situation had arisen purely as a result of the fall. If not for the fall, and the victim's inability to get up on his own thereafter, (the two of them) would not have attempted to lift or move him,"" Judge Lee was quoted as saying in The Straits Times.

""In fact, if not for the (injury) sustained by the victim from the fall, the dropping and manhandling of the victim per se would not have resulted in his death.""

Sakthivel also submitted a Google (NASDAQ: ) Street View image from October 2019 to support his position that there was already a hole on the ground where the incident occurred.

The judge said none of the eyewitnesses had seen the victim losing his footing after stepping on uneven ground.

In addition, he said that based on the manner in which Manjunatha took his steps, as seen in video footage, and the extremely short time between when he was hit and when he fell, it was clear that he had fallen to the ground as a result of having been hit.

""Even if the victim had fallen after stepping into the hole, it would still have been attributable to the hit by the accused,"" the judge said.

Sakthivel will return to court in November for sentencing.

2022-10-28, IANS,Social media platforms wage war against growing pro-Hamas content,https://in.investing.com/news/social-media-platforms-wage-war-against-growing-prohamas-content-3872296,"New Delhi, Oct 28 (IANS) As pro-Hamas accounts flooded various social media platforms amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, governments took cognisance of the delicate situation and warned Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), X (formerly Twitter), Telegram and others to either fix their content moderation algorithms or face actionIsrael-based social threat intelligence firm Cyabra found that from over 162,000 profiles engaged in conversations about Hamas’s attacks, 25 per cent -- more than 40,000 profiles -- were fake.

Those fake profiles disseminated over 312,000 pro-Hamas posts and comments, with some of the accounts publishing hundreds of posts per day, on major social media platforms.

During the first week of the conflict (October 7-14), US-based for-profit organisation NewsGuard analysed the 250 most-engaged posts (likes, reposts, replies, and bookmarks) that promoted one of 10 prominent false or unsubstantiated narratives relating to the war.

It found that verified users with Blue badges are the ones spreading the vast majority of misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war on X.

The results revealed that 186 out of these 250 posts -- 74 per cent -- were posted by accounts verified by X.

“Nearly three-fourths of the most viral posts on X advancing misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war are being pushed by ‘verified' X accounts,” according to the analysis.

The European Commission formally opened an investigation into X over alleged spreading of illegal content and disinformation, in particular the spreading of terrorist and violent content and hate speech in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. The Commission sent a formal notice to X under the Digital Services Act (DSA).

X CEO Linda Yaccarino said the platform is ""coordinating with industry peers to respond to terrorist content being distributed online"" and ""taking action to remove content and bad actors that violate our policies"".

She stated that the company is actively working with partners, governments, regulators and policymakers to combat misinformation.

Earlier, EU commissioner Thierry Breton had warned Elon Musk, saying that his X platform “is being used to disseminate illegal content and disinformation in the EU” after the October 7 Hamas attacks in Israel.

Responding to the EU's request, Yaccarino said that the microblogging platform has removed hundreds of ""Hamas-linked accounts"" and ""taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content"" since the attack on Israel.

Commissioner Breton also wrote to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, telling him to remove pro-Hamas content across his platforms and “be very vigilant” else it could put the company in violation of new EU regulations.

In a letter to Zuckerberg, Breton urged Meta to remove illegal terrorist content and hate speech amid the ongoing war in Israel.

He said that the European Commission had seen “a surge of illegal content and disinformation being disseminated in the EU.”

“I urgently invite you to ensure that your systems are effective. Needless to say, I also expect you to be in contact with the relevant law enforcement authorities and Europol, and ensure that you respond promptly to any requests,” he noted.

In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company has created a “special operations center with experts, including fluent Hebrew and Arabic speakers” after the Hamas attacks on Israel and curbed the spread of misinformation about the war on its platforms.

“Content containing praise for Hamas, which is designated by Meta as a Dangerous Organisation, or violent and graphic content, for example, is not allowed on our platforms. We can make errors and that is why we offer an appeals process for people to tell us when they think we have made the wrong decision, so we can look into it,” it said last week.

In the three days following October 7, Meta removed or marked as disturbing more than 795,000 pieces of content for violating these policies in Hebrew and Arabic.

Another social media platform Telegram had to block channels used by Hamas, but only on Android phones owing to violations of Google’s app store guidelines.

The Jerusalem Post reported that the official Telegram channels of Hamas and the al-Qassam Brigades became “inaccessible for Telegram users who downloaded the app through the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store”.

Telegram responded to the block, saying “Some of the channels you are following may stop being accessible in your version of Telegram because of Google Play’s guidelines.”

Telegram has allegedly served as one of the central platforms for Hamas, its supporters, and other Palestinian terrorist groups to publish statements and propaganda, according to the report.

Chinese short-video-making app TikTok also said that the platform removed over 500,000 videos and closed 8,000 livestreams to date since the attack on Israel by the Palestinian militant group Hamas for violating the company's guidelines.

Google was yet to comment on the development.

In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10 per cent stake.

In September, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) said it will invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic with a minority ownership position in the company, as competition grows in the growing generative AI market ruled by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly on quantitative reasoning.

Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with US Vice President Kamala Harris, along with Alphabet, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and OpenAI.

Anthropic will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) Trainium and Inferentia chips to build, train, and deploy its future foundation models, benefitting from the price, performance, scale, and security of AWS.

As of July 2022, Anthropic had raised $1.5 billion in funding.

Anthropic was founded in 2021 by former senior members of OpenAI, principally Daniela Amodei and Dario Amodei, the latter of whom served as OpenAI's Vice President of Research.

The $26.3 billion amount was made public after a debate between the tech company and Judge Amit Mehta over “whether the figure should be redacted”.

“Mehta has begun to push for more openness in the trial in general, and this was one of the most significant new pieces of information to be shared openly,” the report mentioned late on Friday.

In its latest quarterly earnings report this week, Google said that its Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion were up 11 per cent, led again by growth in retail.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion in the quarter were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

The company's entire ad business -- which also includes YouTube ads -- made a bit under $90 billion in profit in the last year.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,Alphabet shares record third straight loss amid tough market conditions,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-shares-record-third-straight-loss-amid-tough-market-conditions-93CH-3872000,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc. has marked its third consecutive loss in a challenging stock market environment on Friday, with its shares closing at $122.17, a drop of $19.05 from its 52-week high achieved on October 12th, 2022. This downward trend contrasts with the rising share prices of competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

The trading volume for Alphabet was notably high, with 43.7 million shares changing hands, significantly above its 50-day average of 27.5 million shares. This surge in trading activity underscores the intensity of the recent market dynamics.

The performance of Alphabet's stock is particularly noteworthy given the broader context of the stock market and the performance of its peers. The company's peak value date, consecutive losses, competitors' performance, trading volumes and the overall stock market environment are key factors to consider in understanding Alphabet's current position in the market.

While Alphabet has been experiencing a downtrend, competitors Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have seen their share prices rise. This divergence in performance highlights the competitive dynamics currently at play in the tech sector.

The date of Alphabet's peak value on October 12th and the subsequent consecutive losses are significant indicators of the company's recent stock performance. However, it remains to be seen how these trends will evolve in light of the overall stock market environment and the performance of Alphabet's competitors.

The company issued updated guidelines outlining which findings will be eligible for rewards and which are not.

For instance, discovering training data extraction that discloses private, sensitive information is within scope, but if it just shows public, nonsensitive data, it does not qualify for a reward.

Last year, the tech giant issued over $12 million in rewards to security researchers who tested their products for vulnerabilities.

In addition, Google said it is expanding its open-source security work and building upon its prior collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, to further protect against machine learning supply chain attacks.

2022-10-27, Investing.com,"Amazon,  PCE data, Bank of Japan - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon--pce-data-bank-of-japan--whats-moving-markets-3870339,"Investing.com -- Amazon shines with its third-quarter earnings, helping push Wall Street into a positive close to the week. The Fed's favorite gauge is due later in the session, while crude prices gain on elevated Middle East tensions. Next week's Bank of Japan meeting also looms large.

1. Amazon shines in third quarter

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) was the latest of the major tech companies to report third-quarter results, and the e-commerce giant topped expectations as growth in its cloud business continued to stabilize and advertising growth jumped.

Amazon Web Services, its cloud business segment, grew revenue 12% to $23.1 billion, while advertising revenue jumped 26% to $12.06 billion from a year earlier.

""[O]ur AWS growth continued to stabilize, our advertising revenue grew robustly, and overall operating income and free cash flow rose significantly,” said CEO Andy Jassy.

The company has sought to bolster its cloud presence, taking on major rivals Google (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), with a deal to invest up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic, and has also reorganized its delivery network, letting it fulfill orders faster than before, and more cheaply.

Its stock jumped more than 5% premarket, with the results released after the close Thursday, even while warning that consumers remained wary about spending going into the holiday quarter.

""We still see customers remaining cautious about price, trading down where they can and seeking out deals,"" said CFO Brian Olsavsky.

2. Futures higher, helped by strong Amazon numbers

U.S. stock futures edged higher Friday, ending a difficult week on a positive note after strong earnings from e-commerce giant Amazon.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 107 points or 0.3%, rose by 25 points or 0.6%, and rose by 138 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, with the tech-heavy shedding 1.8%, on course for weekly losses of about 3% and on pace for its third straight losing week.

The broad-based closed 1.2% lower, off 2% on the week, while the blue chip dropped 0.8%, its sixth negative session in seven, set for a weekly loss of 1%.

However, the tone has turned Friday following the release of strong numbers from Amazon [see above].

More earnings are due from oil giants Chevron (NYSE: ) and Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) before the opening bell, as well as from consumer product company Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: ).

3. Fed’s favorite inflation gauge due

The U.S. is seen as a near certainty to pause on further interest rate hikes at its meeting next week, but Thursday's unexpectedly strong reading on third quarter has created an element of doubt over December’s meeting.

This means Friday's report on inflation in the form of the will carry extra significance, given the reading of which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.

Analysts expect the September headline reading to rise 3.4% for the year and 0.3% for the month, while the core PCE, which strips out fuel and energy prices, is expected to rise 3.7% for the year and 0.3% for the month.

Fed Chair was at pains to point out last week that above-trend economic growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk and could warrant further tightening of monetary policy.""

With the GDP data surprising to the upside, any indications that inflation is starting to grow again could change the narrative surrounding further Fed decisions.

4. BOJ meeting looms large

Next week sees central bank policy-setting meetings in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. While the Fed gathering always attracts the most attention, it may well be officials that have the most to discuss.

The Japanese central bank will face growing pressure to shift further away from its controversial bond yield control, amid rising global bond yields and persistent inflation.

The BOJ has been laying the groundwork for an eventual end to negative interest rates, but this meeting is expected to be too early for such a move with BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda warning of the fallout from slowing global growth.

That said, rose 3.3% on the year in October, remaining persistently above the central bank’s 2% target, while the widening gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates has seen the yen trade above 150 against the U.S. dollar, near the three-decade low of 151.94 that prompted government intervention a year ago.

A weak yen tends to boost imported food and fuel prices.

5. Crude rises on U.S. strikes on Syria

Crude prices rose Friday on concerns of a widening of the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially impacting supply in this oil-rich region.

By 04:45 ET, the futures traded 2% higher at $84.89 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2% to $89.70 a barrel.

The crude market rose after the Pentagon confirmed that the U.S. had launched strikes on two facilities in eastern Syria that it claimed were used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and were in response to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

These strikes increased worries of a wider war in the Middle East, potentially impacting crude shipments from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and other large producers in the Gulf.

However, both benchmarks are still on track to post their first weekly drop in three weeks as the geopolitical premium built on these fears has ebbed as there has been no disruption of oil supply so far."

The and declined over 0.76% and 1% respectively, reflecting investor concerns over an anticipated economic slowdown.

In the midst of these market fluctuations, tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) fell short of impressing investors, despite exceeding revenue and earnings targets. Meta Platforms, in particular, suffered a 3.7% stock drop after warning of ""volatility"" in the ad market. This news came as a surprise to many investors, given the company's recent surge in quarterly profit.

The market also responded poorly to Alphabet and Tesla (NASDAQ: ), amplifying investor unease. Toymakers Hasbro (NASDAQ: ) and Mattel (NASDAQ: ) saw their shares fall, while drugmaker Merck (NS: ) and IBM (NYSE: ) experienced gains.

Commodity prices followed suit with the stock market trend, with West Texas Intermediate and both decreasing by 2.3%. also slipped by 1.6%, and the fell by 10.6 basis points.

Despite the strong Q3 GDP growth, Wall Street's reaction underscores the complex interplay between economic indicators and investor sentiment.

“He testified about the emphasis Google places on R&D and innovation, disputing the notion that Google’s search product is higher quality in countries other than the US where it faces increased competition,” the X account further posted.

Raghavan also testified that Google faces intense competition from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

He disagreed with the Department of Justice’s standpoint of Google as a “one-stop shop” because he thinks it’s not how users think about their searches.

When asked about a 1998 article about Yahoo!'s dominance of search, Raghavan said he was aware rivals from Expedia.com to Instagram to TikTok competed for users' attention.

""I feel a keen sense not to become the next roadkill,"" said Raghavan who reports to Pichai. Raghavan is a Senior Vice President at Google, responsible for Google Search, Assistant, Geo, Ads, Commerce and Payments products.

Amandeep Singh, the Secretary-General’s envoy on technology and an under-secretary-general, will lead the panel.

As a member of the Indian Foreign Service, Gill was the permanent representative to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.

Giving an example of “the incredible possibilities – and the potential dangers – of AI”, Guterres said that an AI app gave him “the surreal experience of watching myself deliver a speech in flawless Chinese, despite the fact that I do not speak Chinese and the lips movement corresponded exactly to what I was saying”.

“Without entering into a host of doomsday scenarios, it is already clear that the malicious use of AI could undermine trust in institutions, weaken social cohesion, and threaten democracy itself,"" he said.

At the same time, “in our challenging times, AI could power extraordinary progress for humanity”, the UN chief noted.

“The transformative potential of AI for good is difficult even to grasp,"" Guterres said.

The Secretary-General added that he has charged the panel with reporting by the end of the year on three areas: the international governance of artificial intelligence; a shared understanding of risks and challenges, and using it to achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals that cover the gamut from agriculture; and education to health and justice.

Gill said that the panel ""will bring together expertise from around the world from different disciplines, latest expertise on the direction of the technology and its impact on our societies, on our economies and on our politics”.

“The body will look at what is being done today in response to these emerging challenges and what is missing, what are the gaps and how the existing efforts can be better networked together so that we have a more effective governance response.""

Guterres cast a wide net for talent to be on the panel, which includes government officials and religious leaders, academics and activists, and business figures from technology companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) and Sony, drawn from every continent.

Sharad Sharma, co-founder iSPIRT Foundation, and Nazneen Rajani, lead researcher at Hugging Face, from India are on the panel.

2022-10-26, Investing.com,Uber partners with Waymo for autonomous rides in Phoenix,https://in.investing.com/news/uber-partners-with-waymo-for-autonomous-rides-in-phoenix-93CH-3868500,"Uber (NYSE: ), in collaboration with Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Waymo, has launched its first autonomous rides in Phoenix. The service, which starts today, is available within Waymo’s Phoenix service area. Users can book a ride using the Uber app and are notified when they are paired with a driverless Waymo vehicle. The option to confirm or opt for a traditional ride is also provided to the riders.

Rides can be booked through UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric. The fare for these rides is equivalent to regular Uber services and is shown upfront on the app. The vehicle can be accessed using the app which also offers 24/7 customer support along with an in-car screen in the Waymo vehicle.

Waymo's all-electric Jaguar I-PACE is used for these services, which includes destinations within Waymo's newly extended zone, such as Sky Harbor International Airport's 24th St and 44th St SkyTrain locations. Riders can increase their chances of being paired with an autonomous vehicle by adjusting their Ride Preferences in the Uber app.

This development comes after the suspension of Cruise's operations in San Francisco due to safety concerns raised by the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Despite some disruptions caused by Waymo vehicles, Nicole Gavel, Waymo’s head of business development and strategic partnerships, defends the safety of autonomous driving.

According to data released by Waymo, its fleet has been involved in only two collisions requiring towing and 18 minor contact events after over 1 million miles on public roads without a human driver. None of these incidents resulted in reported injuries.

The launch supports Uber's commitment to becoming a zero-emissions mobility platform by 2040 and marks a significant milestone in integrating autonomous driving technology into its hybrid global network. Future plans include expanding this service to driverless deliveries.

“We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We've also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth and adoption,” he said during the company’s Q3 earnings call.

In August, Google opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come.

“With Generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives,” Pichai noted.

He said that ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience.

“People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use Generative AI to create relevant high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey,” the Google CEO added.

Google’s AI chatbot Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels.

“We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web,” said PIchai.

Earlier this month, Google announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help.

One can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, “you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices,” Pichai informed.

Companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data.

“And customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI,” Pichai noted.

For the third quarter, Alphabet’s consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11 per cent in both reported and constant currency.

Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7 per cent, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6 per cent, said the company.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

2022-10-26, IANS,Google rolls out fact-check tool for images globally,https://in.investing.com/news/google-rolls-out-factcheck-tool-for-images-globally-3868071,"San Francisco, Oct 26 (IANS) To help users find high-quality information about what they see online, Google (NASDAQ: ) has rolled out the ""About this image"" fact-check tool to English language users globally in Search.According to the tech giant, the tool will give people an easy way to check the credibility and context of images they see online.

With this tool, users will get to discover an image’s history, metadata and the context users used it with on different sites.

""You can access this tool by clicking on the three dots on an image in Google Images results, or by clicking 'more about this page' in the About this result tool on search results,"" Google said in a blogpost on Wednesday.

An image’s history will allow users to see when an image or similar images may have first been seen by Google Search, and whether it was previously published much earlier on other webpages.

With an image’s metadata, users will be able to see metadata -- when available -- that image creators and publishers have added to an image, including fields that may indicate that it has been generated or enhanced by AI.

Moreover, users can see how an image is used on other pages, and what other sources, like news and fact-checking sites, have to say about it.

This information can be helpful to assess the claims being made about an image and to see evidence and perspectives from other sources, according to Google.

Along with the About this image tool, the tech giant also announced that approved journalists and fact-checkers can upload or copy URLs of images to learn more about them within their own tools with 'FaceCheck Claim Search API'.

In June, the company began testing features using the Fact Check Explorer tool, giving fact-checkers the ability to explore fact-checks, references and other details associated with a particular image.

In addition, the company is experimenting with generative AI to help with the description of sources, for example, a page of an unfamiliar seller or an unknown blog.

2022-10-26, IANS,Big Tech coalition seeks 12-18 month extension to comply with India's DPDP Act,https://in.investing.com/news/big-tech-coalition-seeks-1218-month-extension-to-comply-with-indias-dpdp-act-3867975,"New Delhi, Oct 26 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), an industry group representing Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), on Thursday urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to extend the deadline by 12-18 months to comply with certain provisions under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2022.In a letter addressed to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the group said that since implementing these provisions would require structural changes in organisations and businesses, “they are likely to face significant amount of challenges during the course of such transition”.

“This exercise will be fairly new to domestic and international business entities alike, since compliance with data laws of other jurisdictions like GDPR do not have such provisions. Hence, businesses would require fundamental changes in the technology architecture of their platform,” the coalition wrote in the letter.

The government had said last month that some entities (like startups and MSMEs and establishments like hospitals that handle people's data) may be given a year’s time to fine-tune their systems to comply with the DPDP Act, 2022, as the government officials work with industry stakeholders to formulate detailed rules.

According to the AIC letter, businesses would be required to conduct time-intensive data mapping exercises across all the datasets of the Data Principals in order to comply with Section 5 notice requirements for existing data sets.

“Consent notices would be required to be stored in an accessible manner for Data Fiduciaries to modify or erase Data Principal’s personal data. This would require significant software and hardware upgrade in the infrastructure of the country which is time and financial resource consuming,” the letter read.

Some sections of the DPDP Act introduce a novel concept of the Consent Managers.

“This is not a tested model under Indian law. The Consent Manager framework would have to be developed, tested and finally deployed in the ecosystem. It would also be required to integrate the Consent Manager framework with the Data Fiduciary’s consent architecture,” the AIC letter further argued.

The DPDP Act provides certain additional rights to the Data Principals such as the right to correct, delete, update and erase data under Section 12.

Section 14 of the DPDP Act provides a right to nominate another individual in case of death or incapacity of the Data Principal.

According to the letter, Data Fiduciaries will be required to implement tools that allow Data Principals to enjoy their rights on a real time basis.

“Many businesses may not have the ability to build internal tools and may need to rely on third parties to develop such processes. Such activities are likely to take significant time,” it said.

The AIC requested MeitY “to coordinate harmonization of all the above timelines to provide seamless transition experience to Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors alike”.

“We request that unsynchronised implementation or duplication of efforts be avoided while providing different timelines for different entities with necessary provisions for uninterrupted transition,” the letter read.

From hefty penalties ranging from a minimum of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on social media platforms for violating rules to enabling digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data, the data protection bill envisages the creation of a Data Protection Board of India.

The Bill will apply to the processing of digital personal data within India where such data is collected online, or collected offline and is digitised.

It will also apply to such processing outside the country, if it is for offering goods or services in India.

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.

1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up

It was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.

Meta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.

Additionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.

However, Meta’s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company’s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.

Earnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session’s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and slipped by 140 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.

The tech-heavy fell 2.4%, recording its worst day since February, while the broad-based dropped 1.4% and the blue chip fell 0.3%.

The earnings deluge continues Thursday, with results due from e-commerce giant Amazon the highlight [see above].

Numbers are also due from the likes of pharmaceutical giant Merck (NYSE: ), carrier Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ), auto giant Ford (NYSE: ) and Mexican fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE: ).

There are a number of economic indicators due Thursday, headlined by the first reading of third quarter gross domestic product [see below].

September , , and retail inventory numbers and weekly will be published at the same time as the GDP report.

3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak

The meets later Thursday, and is widely expected to pause its rate-hiking cycle after raising interest rates at its past 10 meetings.

The central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.

A weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.

However, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB’s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.

""The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.

4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly

The Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter , due out later in the session.

GDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

This expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.

However, the is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.

5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise

Crude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session’s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.

The benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.

U.S. climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world’s largest consumer.

However, trading remains volatile, as traders struggle to gauge whether the war would escalate and disrupt crude supplies in the oil-rich Middle East region."

Alphabet slump puts big dent in big tech

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) slumped more than 9% after its better-than-expected were overshadowed by slowing growth in its cloud business.

Google cloud revenue rose 22.5% to $8.41 billion, but that missed Wall Street estimates of $8.6 billion, stoking worries that the tech giant is falling further behind in the artificial intelligence race.

Some tech bulls, however, said the selloff was overdone as its cloud makes up about only 11% of revenue.

“Investors are placing too much relative value on the company's cloud segment which accounts for just ~11% of revenue […] versus the core advertising business which accounts for 78% of revenue,” Wedbush said.

Microsoft shines on earnings stage

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) rose 3% after its better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter were accompanied by stronger growth in its cloud business Azure.

Azure reported growth of 28%, a a 1-point acceleration from 27% in fourth quarter and was “the star of the show,” UBS said, beating analyst expectations of 26%.

In stark contrast, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Azure cloud business reported strong performance, leading to a nearly 13% beat in fiscal Q1 2024 earnings consensus and prompting a 4.5% rise in its stock value.

Several other DJIA components including Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), 3M, Visa (NYSE: ), and Verizon (NYSE: ) also reported successful quarters. 3M raised its full-year earnings outlook following a 14% earnings beat for Q3. Verizon upgraded its free cash flow guidance to $18 billion for the current fiscal year. Visa announced a $25 billion buyback policy after narrowly surpassing market consensus for both earnings and revenue for the quarter. Coca-Cola reported organic sales growth due to increased pricing power and recorded revenue growth of 24% in Latin America from the previous year.

The company had anticipated that artificial intelligence (AI) would boost its cloud-computing business, but the growth rate fell short of expectations. The 22% growth in Q3 did not meet the anticipated 28%, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik.

Shmulik outlined three bullish factors for Alphabet's stock, but two of these were undermined by the recent earnings report. He pointed out that ""optimization efforts,"" indicative of cost-conscious customers, have troubled Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s AWS cloud-computing business for over a year and could potentially impact Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The scope and progression of these optimization issues within GCP are as yet unclear.

The analyst also expressed doubts about significant operating-margin expansion next year due to rising AI-related expenses and an annual $2 billion Sunday Ticket cost. Shmulik suggested that Google needs to restructure its cost base to maintain high-20s operating margins, leaving little scope for earnings and free-cash-flow growth.

The remaining positive factor for Alphabet is Google’s larger advertising business, which exceeded expectations in the recent quarter. Despite reservations about the future of search in an AI era, Shmulik believes the ad business is well-positioned for the upcoming promotional-heavy holiday season. He rates Alphabet’s stock at market perform.

Other analysts also shared their views on Alphabet's performance. Piper Sandler’s Thomas Champion expressed slight disappointment with recent commentary but maintained an overweight rating on the stock and increased his price target to $150. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson highlighted competition costs in the AI arena as a concern for Alphabet investors.

Brad Erickson of RBC Capital Markets suggested that continued execution on search while integrating generative AI and accelerating YouTube could be a compelling approach into next year. Finally, Wedbush’s Scott Devitt held an outperform rating and a $160 target price on the stock, arguing investors are overvaluing Alphabet’s Cloud segment which comprises only ~11% of revenue.

InvestingPro's real-time metrics show that Alphabet Inc. has a market cap of 1600.0B USD, a P/E ratio of 24.5, and a PEG ratio of -2.37. The company's revenue for LTM2022.Q2 stands at 289.53B USD with a growth rate of 4.1%. Alphabet's gross profit for the same period was 160.96B USD, representing a gross profit margin of 55.59%.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alphabet yields high returns on invested capital and holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet. The company also operates with a high return on assets and is a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry. However, it's worth noting that Alphabet's revenue growth has been slowing down recently.

Microsoft's robust growth is attributed to advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which have significantly bolstered its Azure platform's revenues. On the other hand, Alphabet's cloud revenues have lagged behind due to underperforming AI initiatives.

Microsoft's impressive performance is largely driven by substantial cloud revenue from Azure, as revealed in their Q1 earnings report. Microsoft has allocated $11.2 billion for capital expenditure in Q1 of Fiscal 2024 to strengthen its AI infrastructure and cater to the rising cloud demand through Azure. The tech giant foresees further increase in this expenditure. Owing to these strategic investments, Azure is projected to deliver a 26%-27% revenue growth in Q2 FY24.

In contrast, Alphabet has yet to reap significant benefits from its AI initiatives within its cloud division. Nevertheless, the company continues to invest in its cloud platform and integrate AI across its product suite, including its Search business. Alphabet is escalating investments to introduce generative AI capabilities into its products, anticipating a revenue boost from these efforts.

Despite the contrasting performances in the recent quarter, Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on both MSFT and GOOGL stocks. They attribute this optimism to the companies' aggressive investment strategies and expanding AI capabilities. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $401.19 for MSFT and $152.37 for GOOGL, with both stocks receiving a Strong Buy consensus rating.

Baird analysts also recognize Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s AWS as the dominant player in the cloud market. However, Microsoft's recent performance in the sector, bolstered by AI initiatives and Azure growth, has outshone Alphabet's efforts.

Alphabet's ongoing investments and commitment to introducing generative AI capabilities into its products, along with the strength in its Search business, signal promising long-term growth prospects. Despite the differing performances this quarter, both MSFT and GOOGL stocks retain a Strong Buy consensus rating from analysts, indicating a positive outlook for the future.

The option to confirm or opt for a traditional ride is also provided to the riders.

Rides can be booked through UberX, Uber Green, Uber Comfort or Uber Comfort Electric. The fare for these rides is equivalent to regular Uber services and is shown upfront on the app. The vehicle can be accessed using the app which also offers 24/7 customer support along with an in-car screen in the Waymo vehicle.

Waymo's all-electric Jaguar I-PACE is used for these services, which includes destinations within Waymo's newly extended zone, such as Sky Harbor International Airport's 24th St and 44th St SkyTrain locations. Riders can increase their chances of being paired with an autonomous vehicle by adjusting their Ride Preferences in the Uber app.

“We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We've also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth and adoption,” he said during the company’s Q3 earnings call.

In August, Google opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come.

“With Generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives,” Pichai noted.

He said that ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience.

“People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use Generative AI to create relevant high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey,” the Google CEO added.

Google’s AI chatbot Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels.

“We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web,” said PIchai.

Earlier this month, Google announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help.

One can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, “you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices,” Pichai informed.

Companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data.

“And customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI,” Pichai noted.

For the third quarter, Alphabet’s consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11 per cent in both reported and constant currency.

Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7 per cent, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6 per cent, said the company.

YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12 per cent, driven by both brand advertising and direct response.

2022-10-26, IANS,Google rolls out fact-check tool for images globally,https://in.investing.com/news/google-rolls-out-factcheck-tool-for-images-globally-3868071,"San Francisco, Oct 26 (IANS) To help users find high-quality information about what they see online, Google (NASDAQ: ) has rolled out the ""About this image"" fact-check tool to English language users globally in Search.According to the tech giant, the tool will give people an easy way to check the credibility and context of images they see online.

With this tool, users will get to discover an image’s history, metadata and the context users used it with on different sites.

""You can access this tool by clicking on the three dots on an image in Google Images results, or by clicking 'more about this page' in the About this result tool on search results,"" Google said in a blogpost on Wednesday.

An image’s history will allow users to see when an image or similar images may have first been seen by Google Search, and whether it was previously published much earlier on other webpages.

With an image’s metadata, users will be able to see metadata -- when available -- that image creators and publishers have added to an image, including fields that may indicate that it has been generated or enhanced by AI.

Moreover, users can see how an image is used on other pages, and what other sources, like news and fact-checking sites, have to say about it.

This information can be helpful to assess the claims being made about an image and to see evidence and perspectives from other sources, according to Google.

Along with the About this image tool, the tech giant also announced that approved journalists and fact-checkers can upload or copy URLs of images to learn more about them within their own tools with 'FaceCheck Claim Search API'.

In June, the company began testing features using the Fact Check Explorer tool, giving fact-checkers the ability to explore fact-checks, references and other details associated with a particular image.

In addition, the company is experimenting with generative AI to help with the description of sources, for example, a page of an unfamiliar seller or an unknown blog.

2022-10-26, IANS,Big Tech coalition seeks 12-18 month extension to comply with India's DPDP Act,https://in.investing.com/news/big-tech-coalition-seeks-1218-month-extension-to-comply-with-indias-dpdp-act-3867975,"New Delhi, Oct 26 (IANS) The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), an industry group representing Big Tech companies like Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), on Thursday urged the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to extend the deadline by 12-18 months to comply with certain provisions under the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2022.In a letter addressed to Union IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the group said that since implementing these provisions would require structural changes in organisations and businesses, “they are likely to face significant amount of challenges during the course of such transition”.

“This exercise will be fairly new to domestic and international business entities alike, since compliance with data laws of other jurisdictions like GDPR do not have such provisions. Hence, businesses would require fundamental changes in the technology architecture of their platform,” the coalition wrote in the letter.

The government had said last month that some entities (like startups and MSMEs and establishments like hospitals that handle people's data) may be given a year’s time to fine-tune their systems to comply with the DPDP Act, 2022, as the government officials work with industry stakeholders to formulate detailed rules.

According to the AIC letter, businesses would be required to conduct time-intensive data mapping exercises across all the datasets of the Data Principals in order to comply with Section 5 notice requirements for existing data sets.

“Consent notices would be required to be stored in an accessible manner for Data Fiduciaries to modify or erase Data Principal’s personal data. This would require significant software and hardware upgrade in the infrastructure of the country which is time and financial resource consuming,” the letter read.

Some sections of the DPDP Act introduce a novel concept of the Consent Managers.

“This is not a tested model under Indian law. The Consent Manager framework would have to be developed, tested and finally deployed in the ecosystem. It would also be required to integrate the Consent Manager framework with the Data Fiduciary’s consent architecture,” the AIC letter further argued.

The DPDP Act provides certain additional rights to the Data Principals such as the right to correct, delete, update and erase data under Section 12.

Section 14 of the DPDP Act provides a right to nominate another individual in case of death or incapacity of the Data Principal.

According to the letter, Data Fiduciaries will be required to implement tools that allow Data Principals to enjoy their rights on a real time basis.

“Many businesses may not have the ability to build internal tools and may need to rely on third parties to develop such processes. Such activities are likely to take significant time,” it said.

The AIC requested MeitY “to coordinate harmonization of all the above timelines to provide seamless transition experience to Data Principals, Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors alike”.

“We request that unsynchronised implementation or duplication of efforts be avoided while providing different timelines for different entities with necessary provisions for uninterrupted transition,” the letter read.

From hefty penalties ranging from a minimum of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on social media platforms for violating rules to enabling digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data, the data protection bill envisages the creation of a Data Protection Board of India.

The Bill will apply to the processing of digital personal data within India where such data is collected online, or collected offline and is digitised.

It will also apply to such processing outside the country, if it is for offering goods or services in India.

The European Central Bank is expected to halt its rate-hiking cycle, while investors will also focus on the latest quarterly U.S. growth numbers ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting.

1. Meta Platforms falls on revenue guidance; Amazon next up

It was the turn of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) to take the spotlight after the close of trading on Wednesday, as the Facebook and Instagram owner beat expectations for third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by an austerity drive and a recovery in digital advertising ahead of the holiday season.

Meta's operating margin in the third quarter doubled to 40%, while revenue grew at its quickest pace in two years.

Additionally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg stated that Meta is now moving into artificial technology, following the lead of rivals Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), adding AI would constitute Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.

However, Meta’s stock fell over 3% premarket as investors fretted over the company’s guidance for the fourth quarter revenue, with the $38.3 billion estimate coming in 1.6% below expectations.

Earnings from the important tech sector continue Thursday, with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $141.5 billion, after the close.

Investors will look for signs that Amazon's aggressive expansion of same-day delivery services helped increase its third-quarter profit margin by spurring shoppers to place more frequent and bigger orders.

2. Futures fall as the earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures dropped Thursday, continuing the previous session’s selloff with earnings from a series of tech giants driving sentiment.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract dropped 115 points or 0.3%, fell by 26 points or 0.6%, and slipped by 140 points or 1%.

The major indices closed sharply lower Wednesday, as Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) miss on revenue expectations from its cloud operations hit the tech sector, in particular, very hard.

3. ECB to pause lengthy hiking streak

The central bank hiked its key interest rates by 25 basis points, taking the deposit rate to 4.00% and the refinancing rate to 4.50%, but signaled its 14-month-long hiking streak was likely to be its last.

A weakening eurozone economy suggests the need for further tightening is limited, with Germany, Europe's largest economy, likely entering a recession this quarter.

However, inflation, while slowing, remains above the ECB’s medium-term target. Additionally, the conflict in the Middle East is pushing energy prices higher, creating another headwind.

""The biggest challenge will be to keep a balancing act -- not sound aggressively hawkish but keep the door open to rate hikes,"" said ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski.

4. U.S. GDP seen rising strongly

The Federal Reserve policymakers get together next week, and they will have fresh data to consider, including the first reading of third quarter , due out later in the session.

GDP is expected to have increased at a 4.3% annualized rate in the last quarter, which would be the fastest since the fourth quarter of 2021, and far sharper than the 2.1% pace seen in the April-June quarter.

This expected lift in growth will likely come from a boost in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, which has been supported by a strong labor market.

However, the is likely to keep interest rates unchanged at its Oct. 31-Nov. 1 policy meeting, even with a strong GDP number, as financial conditions have already tightened with U.S. Treasury yields surging.

5. Crude slips lower as U.S. inventories rise

Crude prices edged lower Thursday, giving up some of the previous session’s gains as U.S. oil stocks rose while traders continued to focus on developments in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.7% lower at $84.72 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.6% to $89.56 a barrel.

The benchmark contracts settled nearly 2% higher on Wednesday, but have since fallen back after the Wall Street Journal reported that Israel has agreed to delay an expected invasion of Gaza for now.

U.S. climbed by 1.4 million barrels last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, released Wednesday, pointing to weakening demand at the world’s largest consumer.

Alphabet slump puts big dent in big tech

Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ: ) slumped more than 9% after its better-than-expected were overshadowed by slowing growth in its cloud business.

Google cloud revenue rose 22.5% to $8.41 billion, but that missed Wall Street estimates of $8.6 billion, stoking worries that the tech giant is falling further behind in the artificial intelligence race.

Some tech bulls, however, said the selloff was overdone as its cloud makes up about only 11% of revenue.

“Investors are placing too much relative value on the company's cloud segment which accounts for just ~11% of revenue […] versus the core advertising business which accounts for 78% of revenue,” Wedbush said.

Microsoft shines on earnings stage

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) rose 3% after its better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter were accompanied by stronger growth in its cloud business Azure.

Azure reported growth of 28%, a a 1-point acceleration from 27% in fourth quarter and was “the star of the show,” UBS said, beating analyst expectations of 26%.

This was “by far the largest-ever sequential Azure revs growth that Microsoft has ever posted in a Sept quarter,” it added.

Treasury yields resume climb higher ahead of Q3 GDP data

Treasury yields resumed their climb after taking a breather in recent session ahead of economic data due Thursday that will likely show the jump in economic growth in Q3.

Ongoing strength of the economy, which threatens to fuel inflation has been highlighted as a key concern by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell that could force the Fed to lift rates again.

Boeing falls on mixed quarterly results

Boeing Co (NYSE: ) fell more than 2% after the aircraft maker reported a wider than expected loss and cut its annual guidance on 737 Max deliveries amid a manufacturing problem with the aircraft.

In stark contrast, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Azure cloud business reported strong performance, leading to a nearly 13% beat in fiscal Q1 2024 earnings consensus and prompting a 4.5% rise in its stock value.

Several other DJIA components including Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), 3M, Visa (NYSE: ), and Verizon (NYSE: ) also reported successful quarters. 3M raised its full-year earnings outlook following a 14% earnings beat for Q3. Verizon upgraded its free cash flow guidance to $18 billion for the current fiscal year.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,"Alphabet's Q3 earnings fail to meet expectations, stock falls 8%",https://in.investing.com/news/alphabets-q3-earnings-fail-to-meet-expectations-stock-falls-8-93CH-3866818,"Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., saw an 8% decrease in its stock following a disappointing Q3 earnings report. The company had anticipated that artificial intelligence (AI) would boost its cloud-computing business, but the growth rate fell short of expectations. The 22% growth in Q3 did not meet the anticipated 28%, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik.

Shmulik outlined three bullish factors for Alphabet's stock, but two of these were undermined by the recent earnings report. He pointed out that ""optimization efforts,"" indicative of cost-conscious customers, have troubled Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s AWS cloud-computing business for over a year and could potentially impact Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The scope and progression of these optimization issues within GCP are as yet unclear.

The analyst also expressed doubts about significant operating-margin expansion next year due to rising AI-related expenses and an annual $2 billion Sunday Ticket cost. Shmulik suggested that Google needs to restructure its cost base to maintain high-20s operating margins, leaving little scope for earnings and free-cash-flow growth.

The remaining positive factor for Alphabet is Google’s larger advertising business, which exceeded expectations in the recent quarter. Despite reservations about the future of search in an AI era, Shmulik believes the ad business is well-positioned for the upcoming promotional-heavy holiday season. He rates Alphabet’s stock at market perform.

Other analysts also shared their views on Alphabet's performance. Piper Sandler’s Thomas Champion expressed slight disappointment with recent commentary but maintained an overweight rating on the stock and increased his price target to $150. MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson highlighted competition costs in the AI arena as a concern for Alphabet investors.

Brad Erickson of RBC Capital Markets suggested that continued execution on search while integrating generative AI and accelerating YouTube could be a compelling approach into next year. Finally, Wedbush’s Scott Devitt held an outperform rating and a $160 target price on the stock, arguing investors are overvaluing Alphabet’s Cloud segment which comprises only ~11% of revenue.

InvestingPro's real-time metrics show that Alphabet Inc. has a market cap of 1600.0B USD, a P/E ratio of 24.5, and a PEG ratio of -2.37. The company's revenue for LTM2022.Q2 stands at 289.53B USD with a growth rate of 4.1%. Alphabet's gross profit for the same period was 160.96B USD, representing a gross profit margin of 55.59%.

InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alphabet yields high returns on invested capital and holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet. The company also operates with a high return on assets and is a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry. However, it's worth noting that Alphabet's revenue growth has been slowing down recently.

Microsoft's robust growth is attributed to advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which have significantly bolstered its Azure platform's revenues. On the other hand, Alphabet's cloud revenues have lagged behind due to underperforming AI initiatives.

Microsoft's impressive performance is largely driven by substantial cloud revenue from Azure, as revealed in their Q1 earnings report. Microsoft has allocated $11.2 billion for capital expenditure in Q1 of Fiscal 2024 to strengthen its AI infrastructure and cater to the rising cloud demand through Azure. The tech giant foresees further increase in this expenditure. Owing to these strategic investments, Azure is projected to deliver a 26%-27% revenue growth in Q2 FY24.

In contrast, Alphabet has yet to reap significant benefits from its AI initiatives within its cloud division. Nevertheless, the company continues to invest in its cloud platform and integrate AI across its product suite, including its Search business. Alphabet is escalating investments to introduce generative AI capabilities into its products, anticipating a revenue boost from these efforts.

Despite the contrasting performances in the recent quarter, Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on both MSFT and GOOGL stocks. They attribute this optimism to the companies' aggressive investment strategies and expanding AI capabilities. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $401.19 for MSFT and $152.37 for GOOGL, with both stocks receiving a Strong Buy consensus rating.

Baird analysts also recognize Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s AWS as the dominant player in the cloud market. However, Microsoft's recent performance in the sector, bolstered by AI initiatives and Azure growth, has outshone Alphabet's efforts.

Alphabet's ongoing investments and commitment to introducing generative AI capabilities into its products, along with the strength in its Search business, signal promising long-term growth prospects. Despite the differing performances this quarter, both MSFT and GOOGL stocks retain a Strong Buy consensus rating from analysts, indicating a positive outlook for the future.

The government’s case also emphasizes the negative impact of Google’s dominance on consumers and advertisers. They claim that Google's control over search delivers a lower-quality product and restricts consumer choice, particularly concerning privacy-respecting services.

Furthermore, the government alleges that Google's dominance in search has allowed it to control the online ad market, leading to inflated ad prices. Witnesses have included executives from Microsoft, Bing, major advertisers like Home Depot (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), DuckDuckGo, and former Google employees such as Sridhar Ramaswamy.

Joshua Lowcock, an executive from an ad buying firm, testified about Google's share of search and its appeal to his firm’s clients. Arjan Dijk, a former Google executive now at Booking (NASDAQ: ).com, discussed Google’s dominant pool of potential customers. Evidence presented includes an email from Jerry Dischler, a Google executive discussing potential strategies to increase ad revenue and testimony from Jeff Hurst, the former COO of Expedia (NASDAQ: ), about Vrbo's experience with Google's inflated ad prices.

Presiding Judge Amit P. Mehta heard testimony from Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, about his company's struggles due to Google’s control over default search engines. Today, Google is preparing for its defense, maintaining that users can easily switch default search engines and that it continuously improves its search engine for the benefit of consumers.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,"Microsoft, Alphabet, Chinese sovereign debt, Deutsche Bank - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-alphabet-chinese-sovereign-debt-deutsche-bank--whats-moving-markets-432SI-3865597,"Investing.com -- Results from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) receive differing reactions as quarterly earnings season continues with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and IBM (NYSE: ) due. Beijing has decided to issue a substantial amount of sovereign debt to support the struggling Chinese economy, while results from Deutsche Bank come in ahead of expectations.

1. Microsoft outshines Alphabet; Meta Platforms due next

Microsoft (MSFT) took the honors at the start of the reporting quarter for the tech giants, the companies that have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain.

The software giant beat expectations, after the close Tuesday, with its fiscal first-quarter results, as its investment in artificial intelligence bolstered growth in its cloud business Azure.

Microsoft has emerged as an AI frontrunner, largely due to its substantial investment into startup OpenAI, the maker of the popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.

Alphabet (GOOG), by contrast, disappointed, as the Google-parent's cloud business crawled to its slowest growth in at least 11 quarters.

Companies have curbed spending on cloud-related services, including expensive AI tools, slowing revenue growth at Google's cloud unit to 22.5% in the third quarter, from 28% in the prior three-month period.

Microsoft’s stock rose almost 4% premarket, while Alphabet's stock fell almost 6%.

The tech deluge continues Wednesday, with numbers due from Meta Platforms (META) later in the day.

The Facebook and Instagram parent is expected to report earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $33.6 billion, and analysts will be listening for updates on its efficiency efforts and advertising business.

2. Futures largely lower as earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures edged largely lower Wednesday, as investors digested quarterly results from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet, with more influential companies still to report earnings.

At 04:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the Dow futures contract climbed 30 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures fell by 14 points or 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped by 75 points or 0.5%.

The major indices closed higher Tuesday, as U.S. Treasury yields eased off their Monday highs, helping to reduce the pressure on the tech sector, in particular.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9%, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6%.

Investors will be able to study the earnings from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet [see above] ahead of more results from the sector from Meta Platforms and IBM (IBM) later in the day.

Boeing (NYSE: ) will also be in focus, and the airplane maker is expected to report a loss per share of $3.23 on revenue of $18.1 billion, with analysts listening for updates on production and delivery.

The economic data slate is largely empty Wednesday, with only September’s building permits and new home sales numbers due, providing insight into the country’s housing market.

3. China to issue sovereign debt to support economy

China announced plans, late Tuesday, to boost its economy by issuing one trillion yuan ($137 billion) of sovereign bonds, designed to support the rebuilding of disaster-hit areas in the country and improve the general infrastructure.

""After the treasury bond funds are put into use, it will help drive domestic demand and further consolidate the recovery of the economy,"" China's vice finance minister Zhu Zhongming said on Wednesday at a news conference.

The country's 2022 budget deficit will rise to around 3.8% of gross domestic product from a previously set 3%, Xinhua said.

The second-largest economy in the world grew faster than expected in the third quarter, but the drag from the country’s highly-indebted property sector may hit the chances that Beijing can meet its growth target of around 5% for 2022.

4. Deutsche Bank confirms current banking trends

The latest results from Deutsche Bank (DBKGn) underscored current trends in global banking, with the German banking giant posting a 8% drop in third-quarter profit, as revenue at the investment bank slumped but grew in the retail and corporate divisions on the back of higher interest rates.

Although earnings dropped, net profit came in more than €1 billion (€1 = $1.0585), better than expected, marking the 13th consecutive profitable quarter after years of hefty losses.

Deutsche Bank’s stock rose over 6% in Frankfurt trading.

""These results demonstrate strong and sustained business growth momentum combined with continued cost discipline,"" Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said.

However, with the investment bank facing uncertain business prospects and the increasingly important retail division potentially hit as the country heads towards recession, upcoming quarters could prove less successful.

5. Crude just off two-week lows

Crude prices edged higher Wednesday, climbing off a two-week low as concerns about slowing European demand competed with worries of Middle East supply disruptions for attention.

By 04:45 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $83.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $88.30 a barrel.

The benchmarks fell about 2% in the previous session following the release of weak business activity data from the eurozone, suggesting this important oil-consuming region is heading towards recession, which could in turn hit demand for crude.

The prospect of a deescalation in the Israel-Hamas war also stymied bets that the conflict will disrupt Middle Eastern oil supply, as multiple reports suggested that Israel had delayed a planned ground assault on Gaza.

This largely overshadowed positive economic news from the U.S., as well as data from the American Petroleum Institute industry body showing that U.S. inventories shrank more than 2 million barrels last week, with fuel demand remaining strong even after the end of the summer season.

The official data from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due later in the session."

Tech adds to gains as Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) set for earnings stage

Technology stocks added to gains from a day earlier as investors looked ahead to quarterly results from Microsoft and Google (GOOGL) due after the market closes.

“We expect Microsoft to continue to communicate optimizations are ongoing and new workloads remain modest as IT budgets stay tight, resulting in prudence around core Azure growth for F2Q24,” RBC said in a Tuesday note.

Google, meanwhile, is “well positioned” heading into earnings, Wedbush says, supported by ongoing digital advertising growth in 3Q and 4Q.

Treasury yields steady after recent selloff

Treasury yields steadied after a selloff a day earlier, but the move lower doesn’t appear to be a “fundamental shift in investors’ sentiment of policy or the underlying economy, but rather a number of larger players shifting positions,” Stifel said in a note.

Treasury yields sold off sharply on Monday, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury retreating after famed investor Bill Ackman announced that he had closed his bet on lower bond prices, citing “too much risk.”

Oil bounces as Gaza diplomacy continues

Crude prices edged higher Tuesday, bouncing after the previous session’s sharp losses, as developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the potential for a wider conflict in this important oil-exporting region remained the dominant theme.

The benchmarks tumbled around 3% on Monday as a series of diplomatic missions to Israel and Gaza pushed up hopes over a de-escalation in the conflict. This was also accompanied by Hamas agreeing to free some hostages.

However, the situation remains highly fluid with the market seemingly divided over whether the conflict will continue to ease from here or flare up again.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,Google prepares defense in ongoing antitrust trial,https://in.investing.com/news/google-prepares-defense-in-ongoing-antitrust-trial-93CH-3865703,"In the ongoing antitrust trial, U.S. et al. v. Google (NASDAQ: ), the Department of Justice and state attorneys general are arguing that Google has employed illegal tactics to maintain its search and search ads monopolies, which they claim have resulted in harm to consumers and advertisers. As part of their case, the prosecution asserts that Google sustains its monopoly by paying over $10 billion annually to Apple (NASDAQ: ) and other tech platforms to secure default search engine status, hindering competition from other search engines like Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Bing and DuckDuckGo.

Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, argues that Google's significant scale creates a feedback loop that distorts the competitive landscape. The government’s case also emphasizes the negative impact of Google’s dominance on consumers and advertisers. They claim that Google's control over search delivers a lower-quality product and restricts consumer choice, particularly concerning privacy-respecting services.

Furthermore, the government alleges that Google's dominance in search has allowed it to control the online ad market, leading to inflated ad prices. Witnesses have included executives from Microsoft, Bing, major advertisers like Home Depot (NYSE: ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), DuckDuckGo, and former Google employees such as Sridhar Ramaswamy.

Joshua Lowcock, an executive from an ad buying firm, testified about Google's share of search and its appeal to his firm’s clients. Arjan Dijk, a former Google executive now at Booking (NASDAQ: ).com, discussed Google’s dominant pool of potential customers. Evidence presented includes an email from Jerry Dischler, a Google executive discussing potential strategies to increase ad revenue and testimony from Jeff Hurst, the former COO of Expedia (NASDAQ: ), about Vrbo's experience with Google's inflated ad prices.

Presiding Judge Amit P. Mehta heard testimony from Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, about his company's struggles due to Google’s control over default search engines. Today, Google is preparing for its defense, maintaining that users can easily switch default search engines and that it continuously improves its search engine for the benefit of consumers.

2022-10-25, Investing.com,"Microsoft, Alphabet, Chinese sovereign debt, Deutsche Bank - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-alphabet-chinese-sovereign-debt-deutsche-bank--whats-moving-markets-432SI-3865597,"Investing.com -- Results from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) receive differing reactions as quarterly earnings season continues with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and IBM (NYSE: ) due. Beijing has decided to issue a substantial amount of sovereign debt to support the struggling Chinese economy, while results from Deutsche Bank come in ahead of expectations.

1. Microsoft outshines Alphabet; Meta Platforms due next

Microsoft (MSFT) took the honors at the start of the reporting quarter for the tech giants, the companies that have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain.

The software giant beat expectations, after the close Tuesday, with its fiscal first-quarter results, as its investment in artificial intelligence bolstered growth in its cloud business Azure.

Microsoft has emerged as an AI frontrunner, largely due to its substantial investment into startup OpenAI, the maker of the popular generative AI chatbot ChatGPT.

Alphabet (GOOG), by contrast, disappointed, as the Google-parent's cloud business crawled to its slowest growth in at least 11 quarters.

Companies have curbed spending on cloud-related services, including expensive AI tools, slowing revenue growth at Google's cloud unit to 22.5% in the third quarter, from 28% in the prior three-month period.

Microsoft’s stock rose almost 4% premarket, while Alphabet's stock fell almost 6%.

The tech deluge continues Wednesday, with numbers due from Meta Platforms (META) later in the day.

The Facebook and Instagram parent is expected to report earnings per share of $3.64 on revenue of $33.6 billion, and analysts will be listening for updates on its efficiency efforts and advertising business.

2. Futures largely lower as earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures edged largely lower Wednesday, as investors digested quarterly results from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet, with more influential companies still to report earnings.

At 04:45 ET (08:45 GMT), the Dow futures contract climbed 30 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures fell by 14 points or 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped by 75 points or 0.5%.

The major indices closed higher Tuesday, as U.S. Treasury yields eased off their Monday highs, helping to reduce the pressure on the tech sector, in particular.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9%, while the broad-based S&P 500 gained 0.7% and the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average 0.6%.

Investors will be able to study the earnings from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet [see above] ahead of more results from the sector from Meta Platforms and IBM (IBM) later in the day.

Boeing (NYSE: ) will also be in focus, and the airplane maker is expected to report a loss per share of $3.23 on revenue of $18.1 billion, with analysts listening for updates on production and delivery.

The economic data slate is largely empty Wednesday, with only September’s building permits and new home sales numbers due, providing insight into the country’s housing market.

3. China to issue sovereign debt to support economy

China announced plans, late Tuesday, to boost its economy by issuing one trillion yuan ($137 billion) of sovereign bonds, designed to support the rebuilding of disaster-hit areas in the country and improve the general infrastructure.

""After the treasury bond funds are put into use, it will help drive domestic demand and further consolidate the recovery of the economy,"" China's vice finance minister Zhu Zhongming said on Wednesday at a news conference.

The country's 2022 budget deficit will rise to around 3.8% of gross domestic product from a previously set 3%, Xinhua said.

The second-largest economy in the world grew faster than expected in the third quarter, but the drag from the country’s highly-indebted property sector may hit the chances that Beijing can meet its growth target of around 5% for 2022.

4. Deutsche Bank confirms current banking trends

The latest results from Deutsche Bank (DBKGn) underscored current trends in global banking, with the German banking giant posting a 8% drop in third-quarter profit, as revenue at the investment bank slumped but grew in the retail and corporate divisions on the back of higher interest rates.

Although earnings dropped, net profit came in more than €1 billion (€1 = $1.0585), better than expected, marking the 13th consecutive profitable quarter after years of hefty losses.

Deutsche Bank’s stock rose over 6% in Frankfurt trading.

""These results demonstrate strong and sustained business growth momentum combined with continued cost discipline,"" Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing said.

However, with the investment bank facing uncertain business prospects and the increasingly important retail division potentially hit as the country heads towards recession, upcoming quarters could prove less successful.

5. Crude just off two-week lows

Crude prices edged higher Wednesday, climbing off a two-week low as concerns about slowing European demand competed with worries of Middle East supply disruptions for attention.

By 04:45 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $83.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $88.30 a barrel.

The benchmarks fell about 2% in the previous session following the release of weak business activity data from the eurozone, suggesting this important oil-consuming region is heading towards recession, which could in turn hit demand for crude.

The prospect of a deescalation in the Israel-Hamas war also stymied bets that the conflict will disrupt Middle Eastern oil supply, as multiple reports suggested that Israel had delayed a planned ground assault on Gaza.

This largely overshadowed positive economic news from the U.S., as well as data from the American Petroleum Institute industry body showing that U.S. inventories shrank more than 2 million barrels last week, with fuel demand remaining strong even after the end of the summer season.

The official data from the Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due later in the session."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% or 204 points, and the Nasdaq rose 0.9%, and the S&P 500 rose 0.7%.

Tech adds to gains as Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) set for earnings stage

Technology stocks added to gains from a day earlier as investors looked ahead to quarterly results from Microsoft and Google (GOOGL) due after the market closes.

For Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ), the focus will likely be on the growth of its cloud segment Azure at a time when the proliferation of artificial intelligence is expected to ease the drag from still-modest enterprise spending.

“We expect Microsoft to continue to communicate optimizations are ongoing and new workloads remain modest as IT budgets stay tight, resulting in prudence around core Azure growth for F2Q24,” RBC said in a Tuesday note.

Google, meanwhile, is “well positioned” heading into earnings, Wedbush says, supported by ongoing digital advertising growth in 3Q and 4Q.

Treasury yields steady after recent selloff

Treasury yields steadied after a selloff a day earlier, but the move lower doesn’t appear to be a “fundamental shift in investors’ sentiment of policy or the underlying economy, but rather a number of larger players shifting positions,” Stifel said in a note.

Treasury yields sold off sharply on Monday, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury retreating after famed investor Bill Ackman announced that he had closed his bet on lower bond prices, citing “too much risk.”

The Federal Open Market Committee two- day meeting gets underway on Oct. 31, and is expected to culminate in unchanged decision next month.

Bitcoin continues to ride ETF optimism

Bitcoin (BitfinexUSD) jumped more than 7% briefly rising above $35,000 for the first since time since 2022 amid ongoing optimism that a spot-bitcoin ETF may soon be approved.

European PMI data pointed to a region heading towards recession, offering the potential for downside surprises in the U.S. equivalent.

1. Microsoft and Alphabet lead earnings deluge

The week’s deluge of major tech earnings starts later Tuesday, with results due from both Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet after the closing bell.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.65 on revenue of $54.5 billion, and investors will be looking more for updates since it closed its deal for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ).

There will also be a big focus on whether the software giant’s big bet on artificial intelligence is paying off at its cloud-computing unit.

Microsoft announced on Monday that it will spend A$5 billion ($3.2 billion) expanding its artificial intelligence and cloud computing abilities in Australia over two years.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) is expected to offer up earnings of $1.45 a share on revenue of $75.9 billion, with investors looking for fresh evidence on the current state of the digital advertising environment.

Alphabet is likely to benefit from its strong cloud division, adding substantial revenue growth, while expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.

2. Futures edge higher ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday, with investors focusing on earnings reports from a number of the very influential tech companies.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 30 points or 0.1%, rose by 8 points or 0.2% and climbed by 55 points or 0.4%.

About 17% of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings, and three-quarters of them have posted earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.

3. Bitcoin soars on ETF speculation

Bitcoin ( ), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continued to surge in early trade Tuesday on speculation that an exchange-traded Bitcoin fund is imminent.

By 04.40 ET, Bitcoin soared 11% to $34,166, having earlier climbed as high as $35,199, its highest level since May 2022. It surged 10% on Monday in its best session for almost a year and its price has doubled in 2022.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been very slow in accepting Bitcoin ETF applications, but speculation is growing that approval is coming after a court ruling that the regulator had been wrong to reject an ETF application from Grayscale Investments.

Numerous reports have emerged this month indicating that the SEC, the country’s gatekeeper, won't appeal the ruling.

Trillions of dollars in institutional money are waiting to enter Bitcoin once an ETF is approved, according to Ernst & Young’s global blockchain leader Paul Brody, in an interview on Monday.

“Any of these other institutional funds, they can’t touch this stuff unless it’s an ETF or some other kind of regulatory blessed activity,” he said.

4. PMI data point to economic slowdown

The economic data slate centers around the release of flash PMIs in Europe and the United States, which will provide clues on the economic picture ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy-setting meeting later this week, and then the Federal Reserve’s get together next week.

The came in at 50.2 in September, suggesting economic growth largely stagnated. With crude prices rising since then, growth could slow as we head into the fourth quarter.

The news from Europe wasn’t encouraging, as business activity in Germany, the eurozone’s dominant economy, contracted for a fourth straight month in October, suggesting a recession is well underway.

The fell to 45.8 in October from September's 46.4, below the 50 level that points to a contraction in business activity.

There was a similar story with the data for the eurozone as a whole, with the region’s falling to 46.5 in October, down from 47.2 the prior month.

This was the lowest reading since November 2020, and outside of the COVID-19 pandemic months it was the weakest since March 2013.

5. Crude edges lower with Gaza in spotlight

Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back early gains as traders continued to fixate on developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the potential wider conflict in this important oil-exporting region.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.3% lower at $85.20 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.3% to $89.59 a barrel.

The benchmarks tumbled around 3% on Monday as a series of diplomatic missions to Israel and Gaza pushed up hopes over a deescalation in the conflict. This was also accompanied by Hamas agreeing to free some hostages.

However, Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza on Monday, and the situation remains highly fluid with the market seemingly divided over whether the conflict will continue to ease from here or flare up again.

The industry group releases its latest estimate of U.S. inventories later in the session, and crude stockpiles were expected to have risen last week, while distillate and gasoline inventories fell.

2022-10-24, IANS,Cairo Peace Summit (Opinion),https://in.investing.com/news/cairo-peace-summit-opinion-3863366,"New Delhi, Oct 24 (IANS) The Cairo Peace Summit, hosted by Egypt and held in the New Administrative Capital, east of the Egyptian capital Cairo, was chaired by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.It was attended by virtually every Arab nation and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who while calling for action “to end this terrible nightmare”, listed three immediate goals -- unhindered humanitarian assistance to besieged civilians in the Gaza Strip; the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages kidnapped from Israel; and committed efforts to curb violence to prevent the conflict from escalating.

The conflict could only be solved with a two-state solution, one for Israelis and one for the Palestinians, he said.

Israel was not represented at the summit.

If we take a close look at the speeches delivered at the summit, we’ll realise that though they reflected growing anger in the region, even among those with close ties to Israel who have often worked as mediators, the sad reality was that the summit was only a talk shop with no concrete action decided upon.

On October 20, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant laid out a three-stage plan in which airstrikes and ""manoeuvring"" - a presumed reference to a ground attack - would aim to root out Hamas before a period of lower intensity mop-up operations.

Then, “a new 'security regime' would be created in Gaza along with the removal of Israel's responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip"", Gallant said.

No one reacted to this statement, but most Arab leaders chose to show their hollowness and contradictory views, when they talked about the safety of Palestinians but shied away for taking or charting a cohesive strategy to counter Israel’s war mongering actions.

On the other hand the European leaders who seem to be supporting Israel’s right to self-defence, strangely forget about the Palestinian’s right to survival, right to self-defence and right to their motherland and ensuring the prevalence of the rule of law, of which every western nation is so enamoured of.

So far, European officials have largely played down Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s civilians, instead stating that Israel has a right to defend itself and asking that Israel allow humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave.

This contradictory stance adopted by European leaders giving Israel the right to defend, though contrasts with the various Arab voices but in reality these Arab voices have also been only rhetorical with no confirmed or planned action against Israel. One reason for this could be that they don’t want the conflict to conflagrate into a wider regional conflict.

Further, the speeches also showed that Summit’s host Egypt was specifically concerned about a massive influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory, something that it fears would, among other things, severely undermine hopes for a Palestinian state. Egypt worries that a mass exodus would risk bringing militants into Sinai, from where they might launch attacks on Israel, endangering its peace treaty with Israel.

On the same footing, King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose country maintains diplomatic links with Israel, voiced ""unequivocal rejection"" of the forced displacement of Palestinians.

""This is a war crime according to international law, and a red line for all of us,"" he said, but shied away from making any substantial statement supporting the Palestinian cause.

Arab countries also fear, and on that count they are not wrong, a repeat of the mass exodus of Palestinians from what is now Israel before and during the 1948 War surrounding its creation, when about 700,000 people fled or were driven out, an event Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Those refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million, were never allowed to return.

Meanwhile Reuters reported last week that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed six naval warships in the Middle East as tensions escalate in the region.

The development comes at a time when the US has sent USS Gerald R Ford, its most advanced carrier, along with a battle group to the West Asia region. Washington is also assisting Israel with A-10 Warthog and F-15E attack planes, along with the latest munitions as the Benjamin Netanyahu-led regime continues its offensive on Gaza.

These developments portend that if the conflict is not managed quickly enough, then it might snowball into a larger regional conflict, drawing other regional powers within its ambit.

Meanwhile, another alarming trend, which could be observed after the latest conflict, is that those who are speaking in favour of Palestinians are being out casted very quickly. The CEO of a leading technology conference stepped down after a wave of backlash over public statements he made on social media accusing Israel of committing “war crimes” and breaching international law.

Paddy Cosgrave, a co-founder of the European tech conference Web Summit which brings together thousands of leading tech startups and firms in Lisbon, Portugal, resigned after receiving backlash from sponsors and attendees. He said his personal views had become a “distraction from the event” and apologised for “any hurt” he had caused.

Apparently, his follow-up posts were not enough to win over a list of key event sponsors including tech heavyweights Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Stripe, who announced they would boycott the event.

In addition, in a letter released on Friday last week, dozens of Hollywood actors and actresses, including Cate Blanchett and Susan Sarandon, urged US President Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

This comes in the background of many business executives pledging to blacklist Harvard students who belong to groups that signed a letter blaming Israel for the latest outbreak of violence, while several journalists have been suspended or fired due to posts that are critical of Israel or express pro-Palestinian views.

Rights advocates say much of the corporate response has minimised the suffering in Gaza and created an atmosphere of fear for workers who want to express support for Palestinians. At the same time Jewish groups have criticised tepid responses or slow reactions to the Hamas attack on 7th October.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organisation in the country, denounced the backlash against the students and statements from US corporate leaders that “lack any meaningful display of sympathy toward Palestinian civilians”.

All these developments if viewed impartially, proves that in today’s world, so- called developed and free nations still believe in spilling blood rather than resolving their conflicts through mediation or adopting a conciliatory approach, and this completely exhibits the hollowness and contradictory nature of their policies and political system, and it doesn’t augurs well for the future.

Despite Tesla's disappointing results causing a 10% stock drop, the remaining six tech giants show promise despite macroeconomic concerns like rising bond yields, inflation fears, and the Israel-Hamas war's oil price impact.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

The Wall Street Breakfast Survey is assessing investors' top holdings among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. For broader Big Tech exposure, investors might consider MicroSectors FANG+ ETN and Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,Dow futures slump as yields soar; major tech earnings in focus,https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-slump-as-yields-soar-major-tech-earnings-in-focus-3862012,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures weakened Monday, weighed by soaring bond yields and as investors warily awaited the release of quarterly earnings from a number of the major tech giants.

By 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), the contract was down 180 points, or 0.5%, traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower and dropped 90 points, or 0.6%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indices on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Chevron set to buy Hess for $53 billion

Elsewhere, the oil market is once more the center of major M&A, as Chevron (NYSE: ) announced plans to buy smaller rival Hess (NYSE: ) in a $53-billion all-stock deal, implying a premium of about 4.9% to the share's last close.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower premarket after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.6% lower at $87.55 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.5% to $91.73 a barrel.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially causing disruption to the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

2022-10-23, IANS,Japan launches probe into Google for alleged antitrust violations: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/japan-launches-probe-into-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-report-3861726,"Tokyo, Oct 23 (IANS) Japan's antitrust commission has launched a probe into Google (NASDAQ: ) for allegedly violating the Antimonopoly Act by demanding preferential treatment from smartphone manufacturers for its search services during their initial setup, a media report said on Monday.According to Nikkei Asia, citing sources, the commission will examine actions such as requests by the tech giant to smartphone makers and others to set its search service as the default in handset software and functions.

Google has over 70 per cent share of search in the Japanese market. The report mentioned that the commission has ruled that any agreement that unfairly benefits its search service or prohibits other companies' services from entering the market would have a major impact on competition.

The decision follows similar actions by antitrust regulators in the European Union (EU), the US and others.

The US Justice Department alleged that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

Meanwhile, the Japanese antitrust commission has dealt with other big tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The commission accepted Amazon Japan's plan to modify its business operations, which were suspected of breaking antitrust rules, in September 2020.

In September 2021, the commission decided to end its inquiry into Apple, in exchange for modifications to the payment arrangements for the ‘reader app,’ which allows users to browse and listen to diverse content.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,US Treasury yield near 5% amid tech earnings and global economic data,https://in.investing.com/news/us-treasury-yield-near-5-amid-tech-earnings-and-global-economic-data-93CH-3861219,"The previous week saw the 10-year US Treasury yield nearing a significant 5%, which led to a decline in stocks due to its record correlation with the . The current scenario suggests that both stocks and bond prices are falling in unison, driven by concerns over prolonged interest rates and term premium. This comes as investors consider factors such as the long-term inflation outlook, bond supply, and government spending plans.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

The attack targets users searching for Notepad++ and PDF converters with fake ads on Google search. These ads take users to a decoy site after filtering out bots and unwanted IP addresses.

The victim is redirected to a fake website advertising the software, while silently fingerprinting the system to determine if the request is originating from a virtual machine.

Users who fail the security check are redirected to the legitimate Notepad++ website. Potential targets are assigned a unique ID for tracking and to make each download unique and time-sensitive, according to the report.

The final-stage malware establishes a connection to a remote domain (""mybigeye[.]icu"") on a custom port and serves follow-on malware through an HTA payload.

""Threat actors are successfully applying evasion techniques that bypass ad verification checks and allow them to target certain types of victims,"" said Jerome Segura, director of threat intelligence, Malwarebytes.

She alleged that Google also denied her promotions in response to her complaints.

The New York jury ordered Google to pay Rowe for both punitive damages and pain and suffering, reports Bloomberg Law.

In an email sent to The Verge, Attorney Cara Green of Outten & Golden said that the “unanimous verdict not only validates Rowe’s allegations of mistreatment by Google,” but that it sends a message that “discrimination and retaliation will not be tolerated in the workplace.”

Green credited “the efforts of thousands of Googlers who walked out in 2018 and demanded reforms.”

Around 20,000 Googlers had protested in 2018 against the Internet giant's handling of sexual harassment and, more broadly, its workplace policies around equity and transparency.

The protest followed an article in The New York Times that spoke about sexual misconduct allegations against senior executives, specifically against Android creator Andy Rubin.

He later denied the claims.

In Rowe’s case, the jury decided that Google did commit gender-based discrimination.

Rowe had 23 years of experience when she started at Google in 2017.

2022-10-24, Investing.com,U.S. stocks were rising as Treasury yields retreated; Big tech earnings in focus,https://in.investing.com/news/us-stocks-were-rising-as-treasury-yields-retreated-big-tech-earnings-in-focus-432SI-3864292,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks were rising as bond yields retreated ahead of the release of quarterly earnings from some major tech companies.

At 09:55 ET (13:55 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 204 points or 0.7%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.6% and the Nasdaq was up 0.7%.

Yields fall back, easing pressure on stocks

The main indices on Wall Street closed in a mixed fashion Monday, as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded above the closely followed 5% level before falling back. The broad-based S&P fell 0.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3%.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to drop Tuesday, falling back to 4.835% and easing the pressure on the highly-leveraged tech sector, in particular.

Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has covered its bond short position, the billionaire investor posted on Monday, saying it was too risky to remain short bonds at current long-term rates.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) top the earnings slate

The earnings season kicks into top gear this week, with around 30% of S&P 500 companies slated to report.

Earnings due from tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) are Tuesday’s highlight after the closing bell.

Coca-Cola (NYSE: ) beat expectations on revenue and profit as consumers took on higher prices. Shares rose 3%. General Motors (NYSE: ) beat expectations for the quarter but pulled back its guidance because of the ongoing labor strike, which has cut into production. Shares dipped rose 1%.

About 17% of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings, and three-quarters of them have posted earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.

U.S. composite PMI slows in October

Investors will also be keeping an eye on the release of flash U.S. PMIs, providing clues on the economic picture ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy-setting meeting next week.

The U.S. composite Purchasing Managers' Index was 51. With crude prices rising, growth could slow heading into the fourth quarter.

The news from Europe wasn’t encouraging, as the eurozone’s composite PMI fell to 46.5 in October, down from 47.2 the prior month. This was the lowest reading since November 2020, and outside of the COVID-19 pandemic months it was the weakest since March 2013.

Oil bounces as Gaza diplomacy continues

Crude prices edged higher Tuesday, bouncing after the previous session’s sharp losses, as developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the potential for a wider conflict in this important oil-exporting region remained the dominant theme.

The benchmarks tumbled around 3% on Monday as a series of diplomatic missions to Israel and Gaza pushed up hopes over a de-escalation in the conflict. This was also accompanied by Hamas agreeing to free some hostages.

However, the situation remains highly fluid with the market seemingly divided over whether the conflict will continue to ease from here or flare up again.

2022-10-24, Investing.com,"Microsoft, Alphabet earnings, Bitcoin, PMI data - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-alphabet-earnings-bitcoin-pmi-data--whats-moving-markets-3863443,"Investing.com -- Tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) lead the earnings slate later in the session Tuesday, while soared in anticipation of the approval of an ETF in the U.S.. European PMI data pointed to a region heading towards recession, offering the potential for downside surprises in the U.S. equivalent.

1. Microsoft and Alphabet lead earnings deluge

The week’s deluge of major tech earnings starts later Tuesday, with results due from both Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet after the closing bell.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.65 on revenue of $54.5 billion, and investors will be looking more for updates since it closed its deal for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ).

There will also be a big focus on whether the software giant’s big bet on artificial intelligence is paying off at its cloud-computing unit.

Microsoft announced on Monday that it will spend A$5 billion ($3.2 billion) expanding its artificial intelligence and cloud computing abilities in Australia over two years.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) is expected to offer up earnings of $1.45 a share on revenue of $75.9 billion, with investors looking for fresh evidence on the current state of the digital advertising environment.

Alphabet is likely to benefit from its strong cloud division, adding substantial revenue growth, while expanding data centers will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.

2. Futures edge higher ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday, with investors focusing on earnings reports from a number of the very influential tech companies.

At 04:40 ET (08:40 GMT), the contract climbed 30 points or 0.1%, rose by 8 points or 0.2% and climbed by 55 points or 0.4%.

The major indices traded in a mixed fashion on Monday, as the benchmark traded above the closely followed 5% level before falling back. The broad-based fell 0.2% and the blue chip fell 0.6%, while the tech-heavy rose 0.3%.

Federal Reserve officials have suggested in recent days that higher bond yields could have the same effect as interest rate increases in helping to cool the economy, and the central bank is widely expected to hold rates steady next week.

The earnings season kicks into top gear this week, with around 30% of S&P 500 companies slated to report.

Earnings due from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet [see above] are the highlight of today’s session [see above], but there are also numbers from the likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), Spotify (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) to study.

About 17% of S&P 500 companies have already reported earnings, and three-quarters of them have posted earnings surpassing analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet.

3. Bitcoin soars on ETF speculation

Bitcoin ( ), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continued to surge in early trade Tuesday on speculation that an exchange-traded Bitcoin fund is imminent.

By 04.40 ET, Bitcoin soared 11% to $34,166, having earlier climbed as high as $35,199, its highest level since May 2022. It surged 10% on Monday in its best session for almost a year and its price has doubled in 2022.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been very slow in accepting Bitcoin ETF applications, but speculation is growing that approval is coming after a court ruling that the regulator had been wrong to reject an ETF application from Grayscale Investments.

Numerous reports have emerged this month indicating that the SEC, the country’s gatekeeper, won't appeal the ruling.

Trillions of dollars in institutional money are waiting to enter Bitcoin once an ETF is approved, according to Ernst & Young’s global blockchain leader Paul Brody, in an interview on Monday.

“Any of these other institutional funds, they can’t touch this stuff unless it’s an ETF or some other kind of regulatory blessed activity,” he said.

4. PMI data point to economic slowdown

The economic data slate centers around the release of flash PMIs in Europe and the United States, which will provide clues on the economic picture ahead of the European Central Bank’s policy-setting meeting later this week, and then the Federal Reserve’s get together next week.

The came in at 50.2 in September, suggesting economic growth largely stagnated. With crude prices rising since then, growth could slow as we head into the fourth quarter.

The news from Europe wasn’t encouraging, as business activity in Germany, the eurozone’s dominant economy, contracted for a fourth straight month in October, suggesting a recession is well underway.

The fell to 45.8 in October from September's 46.4, below the 50 level that points to a contraction in business activity.

There was a similar story with the data for the eurozone as a whole, with the region’s falling to 46.5 in October, down from 47.2 the prior month.

This was the lowest reading since November 2020, and outside of the COVID-19 pandemic months it was the weakest since March 2013.

5. Crude edges lower with Gaza in spotlight

Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back early gains as traders continued to fixate on developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the potential wider conflict in this important oil-exporting region.

By 04:40 ET, the futures traded 0.3% lower at $85.20 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.3% to $89.59 a barrel.

The benchmarks tumbled around 3% on Monday as a series of diplomatic missions to Israel and Gaza pushed up hopes over a deescalation in the conflict. This was also accompanied by Hamas agreeing to free some hostages.

However, Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza on Monday, and the situation remains highly fluid with the market seemingly divided over whether the conflict will continue to ease from here or flare up again.

The industry group releases its latest estimate of U.S. inventories later in the session, and crude stockpiles were expected to have risen last week, while distillate and gasoline inventories fell.

The official data from the , the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due on Wednesday."
2022-10-24, IANS,Cairo Peace Summit (Opinion),https://in.investing.com/news/cairo-peace-summit-opinion-3863366,"New Delhi, Oct 24 (IANS) The Cairo Peace Summit, hosted by Egypt and held in the New Administrative Capital, east of the Egyptian capital Cairo, was chaired by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.It was attended by virtually every Arab nation and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who while calling for action “to end this terrible nightmare”, listed three immediate goals -- unhindered humanitarian assistance to besieged civilians in the Gaza Strip; the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages kidnapped from Israel; and committed efforts to curb violence to prevent the conflict from escalating.

The conflict could only be solved with a two-state solution, one for Israelis and one for the Palestinians, he said.

Israel was not represented at the summit.

If we take a close look at the speeches delivered at the summit, we’ll realise that though they reflected growing anger in the region, even among those with close ties to Israel who have often worked as mediators, the sad reality was that the summit was only a talk shop with no concrete action decided upon.

On October 20, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant laid out a three-stage plan in which airstrikes and ""manoeuvring"" - a presumed reference to a ground attack - would aim to root out Hamas before a period of lower intensity mop-up operations.

Then, “a new 'security regime' would be created in Gaza along with the removal of Israel's responsibility for life in the Gaza Strip"", Gallant said.

No one reacted to this statement, but most Arab leaders chose to show their hollowness and contradictory views, when they talked about the safety of Palestinians but shied away for taking or charting a cohesive strategy to counter Israel’s war mongering actions.

On the other hand the European leaders who seem to be supporting Israel’s right to self-defence, strangely forget about the Palestinian’s right to survival, right to self-defence and right to their motherland and ensuring the prevalence of the rule of law, of which every western nation is so enamoured of.

So far, European officials have largely played down Israel’s attacks on Gaza’s civilians, instead stating that Israel has a right to defend itself and asking that Israel allow humanitarian aid into the besieged enclave.

This contradictory stance adopted by European leaders giving Israel the right to defend, though contrasts with the various Arab voices but in reality these Arab voices have also been only rhetorical with no confirmed or planned action against Israel. One reason for this could be that they don’t want the conflict to conflagrate into a wider regional conflict.

Further, the speeches also showed that Summit’s host Egypt was specifically concerned about a massive influx of Palestinians crossing into its territory, something that it fears would, among other things, severely undermine hopes for a Palestinian state. Egypt worries that a mass exodus would risk bringing militants into Sinai, from where they might launch attacks on Israel, endangering its peace treaty with Israel.

On the same footing, King Abdullah II of Jordan, whose country maintains diplomatic links with Israel, voiced ""unequivocal rejection"" of the forced displacement of Palestinians.

""This is a war crime according to international law, and a red line for all of us,"" he said, but shied away from making any substantial statement supporting the Palestinian cause.

Arab countries also fear, and on that count they are not wrong, a repeat of the mass exodus of Palestinians from what is now Israel before and during the 1948 War surrounding its creation, when about 700,000 people fled or were driven out, an event Palestinians refer to as the Nakba, or catastrophe. Those refugees and their descendants, who now number nearly 6 million, were never allowed to return.

Meanwhile Reuters reported last week that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has deployed six naval warships in the Middle East as tensions escalate in the region.

The development comes at a time when the US has sent USS Gerald R Ford, its most advanced carrier, along with a battle group to the West Asia region. Washington is also assisting Israel with A-10 Warthog and F-15E attack planes, along with the latest munitions as the Benjamin Netanyahu-led regime continues its offensive on Gaza.

These developments portend that if the conflict is not managed quickly enough, then it might snowball into a larger regional conflict, drawing other regional powers within its ambit.

Meanwhile, another alarming trend, which could be observed after the latest conflict, is that those who are speaking in favour of Palestinians are being out casted very quickly. The CEO of a leading technology conference stepped down after a wave of backlash over public statements he made on social media accusing Israel of committing “war crimes” and breaching international law.

Paddy Cosgrave, a co-founder of the European tech conference Web Summit which brings together thousands of leading tech startups and firms in Lisbon, Portugal, resigned after receiving backlash from sponsors and attendees. He said his personal views had become a “distraction from the event” and apologised for “any hurt” he had caused.

Apparently, his follow-up posts were not enough to win over a list of key event sponsors including tech heavyweights Meta (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Stripe, who announced they would boycott the event.

In addition, in a letter released on Friday last week, dozens of Hollywood actors and actresses, including Cate Blanchett and Susan Sarandon, urged US President Joe Biden to call for a ceasefire in Gaza.

This comes in the background of many business executives pledging to blacklist Harvard students who belong to groups that signed a letter blaming Israel for the latest outbreak of violence, while several journalists have been suspended or fired due to posts that are critical of Israel or express pro-Palestinian views.

Rights advocates say much of the corporate response has minimised the suffering in Gaza and created an atmosphere of fear for workers who want to express support for Palestinians. At the same time Jewish groups have criticised tepid responses or slow reactions to the Hamas attack on 7th October.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organisation in the country, denounced the backlash against the students and statements from US corporate leaders that “lack any meaningful display of sympathy toward Palestinian civilians”.

All these developments if viewed impartially, proves that in today’s world, so- called developed and free nations still believe in spilling blood rather than resolving their conflicts through mediation or adopting a conciliatory approach, and this completely exhibits the hollowness and contradictory nature of their policies and political system, and it doesn’t augurs well for the future.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,“Magnificent 7” Tech Giants Initiate Q3 Earnings Season,https://in.investing.com/news/magnificent-7-tech-giants-initiate-q3-earnings-season-93CH-3863025,"The ""Magnificent 7"" of , including Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), have initiated their Q3 earnings season. Despite Tesla's disappointing results causing a 10% stock drop, the remaining six tech giants show promise despite macroeconomic concerns like rising bond yields, inflation fears, and the Israel-Hamas war's oil price impact.

Today, investors' attention is focused on mega-cap tech companies during this earnings season. Last week's initiation by Tesla has set the stage for the Big 5 - Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, and Nvidia. These firms constitute about a quarter of the 's market cap and could significantly influence the broader market with their results.

A strong performance and substantial year-over-year increases are expected to counter any earnings downturn in other sectors. Without these tech giants, average S&P 500 firms' earnings would drop by 5%. Meta Platforms will report this week, followed by Apple and Nvidia in November.

Key areas of focus include Google's Search and YouTube growth, Meta's user base expansion and new offerings, Microsoft's Personal Computing sector performance, and Amazon's cloud computing leadership. AI investment, R&D, and IT spending will be central to earnings calls.

Factors such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s successful earnings report indicating sustained consumer spending on streaming services are favoring Amazon (Prime Video), Alphabet (YouTube), and Apple (popular shows). The upcoming holiday season is expected to boost Amazon's Q3 earnings, which are anticipated to double from last year.

The AI boom could enhance Meta's ad relevance on Instagram and Reels platforms and Nvidia's Q3 growth, contributing to the S&P 500 profit growth. Apple could benefit from iPhone 15 sales while Microsoft may gain from Xbox console sales. Stakeholders in Rivian (NASDAQ: ) (Amazon) and Waymo (Alphabet) could also see gains.

The Wall Street Breakfast Survey is assessing investors' top holdings among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. For broader Big Tech exposure, investors might consider MicroSectors FANG+ ETN and Invesco S&P 500 Top 50 ETF.

Investors have tech earnings on their minds.

1. Microsoft earnings

The software giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.65 on revenue of $54.5 billion. Analysts will be listening for updates since it closed its deal for Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), and on its AI-related projects.

By 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), the contract was down 180 points, or 0.5%, traded 23 points, or 0.6%, lower and dropped 90 points, or 0.6%.

10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbs past 5%

The main indices on Wall Street suffered last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip fell 1.6%.

The benchmark climbed to 5% on Friday, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2007, before slipping slightly.

However, yields have shot up once more Monday, with the 10-yield reaching 5.025%, as investors have become very wary about the potential for rates staying high for longer, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell mentioned the possibility of more monetary tightening in a speech last week.

Earnings from tech giants due

Investors are also on edge ahead of this week’s corporate results, with earnings due from a group of tech stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Chevron set to buy Hess for $53 billion

Elsewhere, the oil market is once more the center of major M&A, as Chevron (NYSE: ) announced plans to buy smaller rival Hess (NYSE: ) in a $53-billion all-stock deal, implying a premium of about 4.9% to the share's last close.

The deal comes weeks after rival Exxon (NYSE: ) made a $60 billion offer for Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE: ) that would make it the biggest producer in the largest U.S. oilfield.

Apple traded lower premarket after Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, faces a tax probe in China, according to a report in Sunday’s state-backed Global Times newspaper.

Oil falls on escalated Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as diplomatic efforts to contain the situation in Gaza escalated, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.6% lower at $87.55 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.5% to $91.73 a barrel.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy.

Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially causing disruption to the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

2022-10-23, IANS,Japan launches probe into Google for alleged antitrust violations: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/japan-launches-probe-into-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-report-3861726,"Tokyo, Oct 23 (IANS) Japan's antitrust commission has launched a probe into Google (NASDAQ: ) for allegedly violating the Antimonopoly Act by demanding preferential treatment from smartphone manufacturers for its search services during their initial setup, a media report said on Monday.According to Nikkei Asia, citing sources, the commission will examine actions such as requests by the tech giant to smartphone makers and others to set its search service as the default in handset software and functions.

Google has over 70 per cent share of search in the Japanese market. The report mentioned that the commission has ruled that any agreement that unfairly benefits its search service or prohibits other companies' services from entering the market would have a major impact on competition.

The decision follows similar actions by antitrust regulators in the European Union (EU), the US and others.

The US Justice Department alleged that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

Meanwhile, the Japanese antitrust commission has dealt with other big tech giants such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The commission accepted Amazon Japan's plan to modify its business operations, which were suspected of breaking antitrust rules, in September 2020.

In September 2021, the commission decided to end its inquiry into Apple, in exchange for modifications to the payment arrangements for the ‘reader app,’ which allows users to browse and listen to diverse content.

2022-10-23, Investing.com,"Treasury yields, Foxconn, tech earnings  - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/treasury-yields-foxconn-tech-earnings---whats-moving-markets-3861700,"Investing.com -- Rising U.S. Treasury yields continue to weigh on stock markets at the start of a week that includes the release of earnings from a number of tech giants. Crude slips back as aid enters Gaza, while Apple is under pressure as its main supplier, Foxconn, faces a tax probe in China.

1. U.S. bond yields rise, with 10-year threatening 5%

U.S. bond yields are on the rise again, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury back up to 4.969% on Monday, just short of the widely-watched 5% threshold, having surged almost 30 basis points last week alone.

Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose briefly to 5% late last week, a level not seen since 2007.

The recent surge in long-term bond yields suggests the market has embraced the idea that rates will remain higher for longer, with a new normal for rates seemingly above the Federal Reserve's pick of 2.5%.

Fed Chair on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

There will be a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter as well as the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the .

Another factor pushing yields higher has been the predicted scale of U.S. borrowing, with Washington last week reporting a $1.695 trillion budget deficit for fiscal 2022, fully 23% higher than the prior year and above all pre-pandemic shortfalls.

2. Futures drift lower ahead of key tech earnings

U.S. stock futures edged lower Monday, starting the new week on a negative note, with rising bond yields and wariness ahead of major tech earnings weighing.

At 05:45 ET (09:45 GMT), the contract dropped 60 points or 0.2%, fell by 5 points or 0.1%, and dropped by 10 points or 0.1%.

The major indices suffered a difficult week last week, with rising U.S. Treasury yields [see above] weighing heavily. The broad-based dropped 2.4%, its first losing week in three, while the tech-heavy fell 3.2% and the blue chip Dow fell 1.6%.

Aside from the rising yields and the uncertain situation in the Middle East, investors will be focusing on corporate results this week, with the earnings season ramping up as a slew of big tech titans are slated to report [see below].

Yet, even with uncertainty surrounding these numbers, a rally in the S&P 500 in the fourth quarter of 2022 ""is more likely than not"", according to analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), in a recent note.

""Many are still leaning more long than they would like, to reduce the probability of missing out in a year in which narrow megacap strength has driven benchmarks,"" the bank said.

3. Major tech earnings in focus this week

The third quarter earnings season is well underway, and has so far been generally well received.

Overall, 17% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for the third quarter, Factset reported on Friday. Of these companies, 73% have reported actual EPS above estimates, with, in aggregate, firms reporting earnings that are 6.6% above estimates.

This general positivity could be tested this week, particularly given the higher U.S. bond yields, with results due from a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

4. Foxconn faces tax probe in China - report

Foxconn (TW: ), a major supplier of Apple's iPhones, is facing a tax probe in China, according to a report in the state-backed Global Times newspaper, released on Sunday.

The tabloid said some of Foxconn's key subsidiaries in China were the subject of tax audits and that China's natural resources department had conducted on-site investigations on land use by Foxconn enterprises in Henan and Hubei provinces.

The public announcement of this audit comes with Foxconn founder Terry Gou seeking to be Taiwan's next president in January, and with Foxconn shifting some of its production lines from China to India.

""We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,"" Foxconn said in a statement,

Foxconn is the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, and assembles consumer products like iPhones for Apple.

Apple stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading.

5. Crude retreats amid hopes for Gaza diplomacy

Crude prices fell Monday as aid convoys began to arrive in Gaza, but geopolitical tensions remained high as Israel continued to bombard the enclave.

By 05:45 ET, the futures traded 0.5% lower at $87.64 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $91.83 a barrel.

Both contracts rose more than 1% last week for a second consecutive weekly jump on fear of potential supply disruption if the Israel-Hamas war grows into a wider confrontation in the Middle East, the world's biggest oil-supplying region.

Israel has so far held off launching a ground assault on the region, likely providing time to negotiate a release of more hostages as well as providing a window for diplomacy. Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza late last week.

U.S. President Joe Biden visited Israel last week, and the leaders of France and the Netherlands will visit this week in search of a solution for the conflict.

That said, Israel has amassed forces around Gaza for a planned ground invasion to eliminate the Islamist group, and it’s this ground attack which is widely seen as a potential trigger for widening the Israel-Hamas conflict, potentially hitting supply in the important region."

2022-10-23, Investing.com,US Treasury yield near 5% amid tech earnings and global economic data,https://in.investing.com/news/us-treasury-yield-near-5-amid-tech-earnings-and-global-economic-data-93CH-3861219,"The previous week saw the 10-year US Treasury yield nearing a significant 5%, which led to a decline in stocks due to its record correlation with the . The current scenario suggests that both stocks and bond prices are falling in unison, driven by concerns over prolonged interest rates and term premium. This comes as investors consider factors such as the long-term inflation outlook, bond supply, and government spending plans.

The ACM model indicates that the term premium is at its highest since 2008. While some market observers attribute this term premium shift to the rise in yields, others argue that the 10-year and 2-year yields are closely linked and tend to peak together.

Despite the rising bond yields, there is potential for upliftment in the stock market. Earnings reports from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) are due for scrutiny this week. These companies, known for their higher P/E ratios, make up a significant portion of the S&P 500's market value. Their performance could influence the direction of the broader market.

Meanwhile, long-position investors are capitulating as bond prices decline with surging yields. The recent yield surge interestingly was not followed by a USD rally, suggesting a potential short-term peak for the currency.

In addition to these developments, several key economic data points are expected in the coming days. These include US durable goods orders and preliminary October PMI reports for the UK, Eurozone, and the US. The week will also see September's core PCE report from the US, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.

On the international front, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current status this week. Geopolitical tensions continue to drive up prices, adding another layer of complexity to global financial markets. As investors navigate this intricate landscape, the upcoming earnings reports and economic data releases are likely to play a critical role in shaping market trends.

U.S. data will give markets another update on the strength of the economy. Oil prices look set to remain choppy and the European Central Bank will announce its latest rate decision. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Risk-off mood

A risk-off mood is dominating markets with investors worried about the prospect of more interest rate hikes and the Israel-Hamas conflict spreading. A weaker-than-expected earnings report for Tesla (NASDAQ: ) last week also darkened the mood.

Wall Street’s most closely watched measure of investor nervousness, the , closed Friday at its highest in nearly seven months. For the week the was down 1.6%, the fell 2.4% and the slid 3.2%.

The benchmark eased on Friday, a day after crossing 5% for the first time since July 2007 in the wake of comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell (see below).

That has left investors piling into other traditional safe-haven assets such as the dollar and , as well as short-term Treasuries or money-market funds, which are providing more attractive returns since interest rates began rising early last year.

Megacap earnings

Third quarter earnings season is well underway and results from four megacap companies are due this week, in what will be a key test for a group of stocks whose gains have propelled the S&P 500 higher this year.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are due to report on Tuesday, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) is to report on Wednesday and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) reports on Thursday.

Those stocks, together with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla have accounted for the bulk of the S&P 500's 10% year-to-date gain, so any disappointing results could result in widespread fallout.

Other big names reporting in the coming week include Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Merck (NYSE: ) and United Parcel Service (NYSE: ). Investors are banking on an overall recovery in U.S. profits after a tepid first half.

U.S. data

Market watchers will get a fresh update on the strength of the U.S. economy this week from data including third-quarter growth and the Fed’s favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumer expenditures price index.

Economists are expecting third quarter to come in at an annualized rate of 4.1%, boosted by strong consumer spending.

The , which excludes volatile food and fuel costs, is forecast to increase 3.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the stronger-than-expected U.S. economy might warrant tighter policy though rising market interest rates could make action by the central bank itself less necessary.

Oil prices

Oil prices settled lower on Friday after the Islamist group Hamas released two U.S. hostages from Gaza, leading to hopes the Israeli-Palestinian crisis could de-escalate without engulfing the rest of the Middle East region and disrupting oil supplies.

futures fell 22 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $92.16 a barrel.

futures for November delivery, which expired after settlement on Friday, fell 62 cents, or 0.7%, to $88.75 a barrel. The more-active December crude contract closed 29 cents lower at $88.08 a barrel.

For the week, both front-month contracts rose over 1%, a second straight weekly jump.

""The Middle East remains a big focus of the market because of fears of a region-wide conflict that would likely involve a disruption of oil supplies,"" John Kilduff, a partner at New York-based Again Capital told Reuters.

ECB likely to hold

The ECB is holding its latest policy on meeting on Thursday, with the broad consensus being for interest rates to remain on hold.

After the ECB hiked its deposit rate at each of its last 10 meetings to a current record high, policymakers have indicated it is time to pause as they assess the impact of monetary tightening so far.

Market participants will be on the lookout for any indications of a possible final rate hike for this year in December.

Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, the Eurozone is to release what will be closely watched October data on Tuesday. Recent economic data has raised concerns over the outlook for the bloc’s economy amid weakening consumer spending in the face of still high inflation.

 Google Ads: Report",https://in.investing.com/news/malvertisers-targeting-users-searching-for-popular-software-via-google-ads-report-3860897,"New Delhi, Oct 22 (IANS) A malvertising campaign has emerged that takes advantage of Google (NASDAQ: ) Ads to direct users searching for popular software to fictitious landing pages and distribute next-stage payloads, a new report has found.According to the cybersecurity company Malwarebytes, the malvertising campaign is ""unique in its way to fingerprint users and distribute time-sensitive payloads"".

The attack targets users searching for Notepad++ and PDF converters with fake ads on Google search. These ads take users to a decoy site after filtering out bots and unwanted IP addresses.

The victim is redirected to a fake website advertising the software, while silently fingerprinting the system to determine if the request is originating from a virtual machine.

Users who fail the security check are redirected to the legitimate Notepad++ website. Potential targets are assigned a unique ID for tracking and to make each download unique and time-sensitive, according to the report.

The final-stage malware establishes a connection to a remote domain (""mybigeye[.]icu"") on a custom port and serves follow-on malware through an HTA payload.

""Threat actors are successfully applying evasion techniques that bypass ad verification checks and allow them to target certain types of victims,"" said Jerome Segura, director of threat intelligence, Malwarebytes.

""With a reliable malware delivery chain in hand, malicious actors can focus on improving their decoy pages and craft custom malware payloads,"" he added.

Users who land on the decoy site are tricked into downloading a malicious installer, which then executes FakeBat (a.k.a EugenLoader), a loader designed to download additional malicious code, the report noted.

She alleged that Google also denied her promotions in response to her complaints.

The New York jury ordered Google to pay Rowe for both punitive damages and pain and suffering, reports Bloomberg Law.

In an email sent to The Verge, Attorney Cara Green of Outten & Golden said that the “unanimous verdict not only validates Rowe’s allegations of mistreatment by Google,” but that it sends a message that “discrimination and retaliation will not be tolerated in the workplace.”

Green credited “the efforts of thousands of Googlers who walked out in 2018 and demanded reforms.”

Around 20,000 Googlers had protested in 2018 against the Internet giant's handling of sexual harassment and, more broadly, its workplace policies around equity and transparency.

The protest followed an article in The New York Times that spoke about sexual misconduct allegations against senior executives, specifically against Android creator Andy Rubin.

He later denied the claims.

In Rowe’s case, the jury decided that Google did commit gender-based discrimination.

Rowe had 23 years of experience when she started at Google in 2017.

Amid a week filled with earnings reports and Powell's address, investors also closely watched the significant surge in Treasury yields.

American Express (NYSE: ) surpassed quarterly estimates, contributing to Wall Street's discourse about the U.S. economy. Despite an increase in charge-offs attributed to first-time cardholders experiencing financial stress due to high inflation, American Express reported positive sales and outlook. In contrast, United Airlines reported disappointing results, flagging risks from higher oil prices.

Sozzi noted the impact of rising mortgage rates and car finance costs on potential homeowners due to the return of student debt. He also highlighted significant trends among younger consumers and their financial behaviors.

Two weeks into the earnings season, the market is preparing for results from big tech players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Sozzi pointed out concerns raised by Jamie Dimon about this being one of the most dangerous times he can recall. The stock market is adjusting to Treasury yields surpassing 5%.

Executives remain cautiously optimistic about the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but there is near-term concern about the impact of interest rates on consumer spending. Data indicates increased charge-offs and caution among retailers and restaurants, with a slight pullback in travel.

""Google announced on Thursday that it was introducing a new feature in Google Search that helps users practice speaking and improving their language skills,"" explained KeyBanc.

Analysts said the Google Search language capabilities will create the overhang over the coming quarters as investors wrestle with how Google's expanding features and countries could alter Sector Weight-rated Duolingo's growth rate. They added that the capabilities seem similar to Duolingo.

""We see three potential risks: 1) engagement - as Google expands this product to more countries and beyond Android, this could weigh on Duolingo's free user growth and engagement; 2) payer penetration - we could see this limiting conversion among free users and causing trade downs among paid Duolingo subscribers; 3) Duolingo Max - recall Max is the high-end tier that provides personalized feedback and chat experiences. While Google's service does not fully replicate this, we do believe it could limit Max's adoption and/or price,"" said analysts.

The plan was unveiled by Google's senior VP of devices services, Rick Osterloh, following a virtual meeting between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

The company will collaborate with international and domestic manufacturers such as Lava International, Dixon Technologies, and Bharat FIH (Foxconn's Indian unit) for local production. These firms have already secured production-linked incentives from the Indian government, further bolstering local manufacturing.

Late last month, PC and printer major HP announced a collaboration with Google to manufacture its Chromebooks in India.

At the flagship ‘Google for India 2022’ event, the company also announced several generative AI-focused features in the country.

“We are making Search Generative Experience more visual and local, by bringing images and videos into many overviews,” said the company.

Users in India will soon be able to get summaries of more than 100 government-led schemes in the country in both Hindi and English.

In August, Google expanded the search generative experience (SGE) to India with a toggle for users to switch from Hindi to English without leaving the results page.

“Generative AI in Search will soon help users explore local places and things to do in a city more seamlessly. Search Generative Experience will also help you with specific details about certain places (such as whether it is wheelchair accessible) by incorporating users reviews,” the company announced.

2022-10-19, IANS,Google slashes 40-45 jobs in its news division: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/google-slashes-4045-jobs-in-its-news-division-report-3856883,"San Francisco, Oct 19 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has slashed dozens of jobs in its news division amid slowed growth and uncertain economic conditions, the media reported. At least 40-45 workers in Google News have lost their jobs, according to an Alphabet Workers Union spokesperson, CNBC reported late on Wednesday.

“We’re deeply committed to a vibrant information ecosystem, and news is a part of that long-term investment,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’ve made some internal changes to streamline our organisation. A small number of employees were impacted. We’re supporting everyone with a transition period, outplacement services and severance as they look for new opportunities at Google and beyond,” said the company.

Google News division still employs hundreds of people. Google News presents links to articles from thousands of publishers and magazines.

“These are some of the best and brightest people I’ve ever worked with. We’re definitely worse off without them,” wrote a staff engineer at Google News on LinkedIn regarding the layoffs.

In January, Google announced it was reducing 12,000 jobs, affecting around 6 per cent of the full-time workforce.

Last month, the company eliminated hundreds of positions from its recruiting organisation.

The tech giant said in a statement that the “volume of requests for our recruiters has gone down”.

Google, however, declined to reveal the exact number of people being asked to go from its recruiting workforce, reports Semafor.

“In order to continue our important work to ensure we operate efficiently, we’ve made the hard decision to reduce the size of our recruiting team,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’re supporting everyone impacted with a transition period, outplacement services, and severance as they look for new opportunities here at Google and beyond,” the spokesperson added.

Google slowed down the pace of hiring last year amid the global economic slowdown.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

Over the next year, YouTube specialists will work with news organisations, including Univision in the US, AFP in France, and Mediacorp in Singapore on Shorts content strategy and video production best practices.

“Our goal with the Shorts Innovation Programme is to jumpstart innovative news publishers who are interested in embracing short-form news capabilities, but haven’t had the resources to do so,” the company added.

“This update builds on our existing business attributes, including Asian-owned, Black-owned, Latino-owned, LGBTQ+ owned, veteran-owned, and women-owned,” said Eve Andersson, senior director, Products for All at Google.

Lens in Maps (formerly known as Search with Live View) uses AI and augmented reality to help people use their phone’s camera to orient themselves in an unfamiliar neighbourhood and discover new places.

To make this more accessible and useful for people who are blind or low-vision, screen reader capabilities in Lens in Maps will be coming to iOS starting Tuesday, and to Android later this year.

“With the option to request wheelchair-accessible walking routes rolling out globally on iOS and Android wherever we have data available, you can get stair-free routes when you request walking directions in Maps,” said Andersson.

This feature builds on the wheelchair-accessible transit navigation option in Maps that shows people step-free transit routes.

Earlier this year, Google made it easy for everyone to find wheelchair-accessible places on Google Maps for Android and iOS.

Now, the company is starting to bring that information to business and place pages on Maps for Android Auto and cars with Google built in.

When you search for a place in Google Maps and click on it, a wheelchair icon will appear if the destination has a step-free entrance, accessible restrooms, parking or seating.

Amid a week filled with earnings reports and Powell's address, investors also closely watched the significant surge in Treasury yields.

American Express (NYSE: ) surpassed quarterly estimates, contributing to Wall Street's discourse about the U.S. economy. Despite an increase in charge-offs attributed to first-time cardholders experiencing financial stress due to high inflation, American Express reported positive sales and outlook. In contrast, United Airlines reported disappointing results, flagging risks from higher oil prices.

Sozzi noted the impact of rising mortgage rates and car finance costs on potential homeowners due to the return of student debt. He also highlighted significant trends among younger consumers and their financial behaviors.

Two weeks into the earnings season, the market is preparing for results from big tech players like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Sozzi pointed out concerns raised by Jamie Dimon about this being one of the most dangerous times he can recall. The stock market is adjusting to Treasury yields surpassing 5%.

Executives remain cautiously optimistic about the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but there is near-term concern about the impact of interest rates on consumer spending. Data indicates increased charge-offs and caution among retailers and restaurants, with a slight pullback in travel.

""Google announced on Thursday that it was introducing a new feature in Google Search that helps users practice speaking and improving their language skills,"" explained KeyBanc.

Analysts said the Google Search language capabilities will create the overhang over the coming quarters as investors wrestle with how Google's expanding features and countries could alter Sector Weight-rated Duolingo's growth rate. They added that the capabilities seem similar to Duolingo.

""We see three potential risks: 1) engagement - as Google expands this product to more countries and beyond Android, this could weigh on Duolingo's free user growth and engagement; 2) payer penetration - we could see this limiting conversion among free users and causing trade downs among paid Duolingo subscribers; 3) Duolingo Max - recall Max is the high-end tier that provides personalized feedback and chat experiences. While Google's service does not fully replicate this, we do believe it could limit Max's adoption and/or price,"" said analysts.

The plan was unveiled by Google's senior VP of devices services, Rick Osterloh, following a virtual meeting between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.

The company will collaborate with international and domestic manufacturers such as Lava International, Dixon Technologies, and Bharat FIH (Foxconn's Indian unit) for local production.

“We look forward to sharing more details in the coming months, and can’t wait to bring the magic of Pixel smartphones to more people across the nation,” he added.

The company is partnering with international and domestic manufacturers in India to produce Pixel smartphones locally.

Google has grown its Pixel service network across the nation. In partnership with F1 Info Solutions, the company now has 28 service centres in 27 cities, and will continue to expand coverage to more locations and cities in the months ahead.

Google has shipped nearly 40 million Pixel smartphones since 2016 and 10 million units in the last 12 months alone, as its newly-launched Pixel 8 series gain initial traction globally, including in India, according to third-party reports.

The company brought all-new Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro smartphones with next-gen AI capabilities, and Pixel Watch 2 in India earlier this month.

Late last month, PC and printer major HP announced a collaboration with Google to manufacture its Chromebooks in India.

At the flagship ‘Google for India 2022’ event, the company also announced several generative AI-focused features in the country.

“We are making Search Generative Experience more visual and local, by bringing images and videos into many overviews,” said the company.

Users in India will soon be able to get summaries of more than 100 government-led schemes in the country in both Hindi and English.

In August, Google expanded the search generative experience (SGE) to India with a toggle for users to switch from Hindi to English without leaving the results page.

“Generative AI in Search will soon help users explore local places and things to do in a city more seamlessly. Search Generative Experience will also help you with specific details about certain places (such as whether it is wheelchair accessible) by incorporating users reviews,” the company announced.

At least 40-45 workers in Google News have lost their jobs, according to an Alphabet Workers Union spokesperson, CNBC reported late on Wednesday.

“We’re deeply committed to a vibrant information ecosystem, and news is a part of that long-term investment,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’ve made some internal changes to streamline our organisation. A small number of employees were impacted. We’re supporting everyone with a transition period, outplacement services and severance as they look for new opportunities at Google and beyond,” said the company.

Google News division still employs hundreds of people. Google News presents links to articles from thousands of publishers and magazines.

“These are some of the best and brightest people I’ve ever worked with. We’re definitely worse off without them,” wrote a staff engineer at Google News on LinkedIn regarding the layoffs.

In January, Google announced it was reducing 12,000 jobs, affecting around 6 per cent of the full-time workforce.

Last month, the company eliminated hundreds of positions from its recruiting organisation.

The tech giant said in a statement that the “volume of requests for our recruiters has gone down”.

Google, however, declined to reveal the exact number of people being asked to go from its recruiting workforce, reports Semafor.

“In order to continue our important work to ensure we operate efficiently, we’ve made the hard decision to reduce the size of our recruiting team,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’re supporting everyone impacted with a transition period, outplacement services, and severance as they look for new opportunities here at Google and beyond,” the spokesperson added.

Google slowed down the pace of hiring last year amid the global economic slowdown.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Tech giants face challenges amidst impressive performance in 2022,https://in.investing.com/news/tech-giants-face-challenges-amidst-impressive-performance-in-2022-93CH-3856843,"In the equity markets of this year, technology companies have shown remarkable performance, with some valuations far exceeding other sectors. Apple (NASDAQ: ), which represents 5.2% of the global index and has seen a 43% increase this year due to innovations such as the iPhone 15, carries a PE ratio of 29x. However, the tech giant now faces potential shifts in Chinese consumer preferences towards local smartphones.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Google), despite showing potential, are facing significant challenges. Microsoft is currently in a dispute with US tax authorities over $28.9bn in back taxes. Alphabet's sales may stagnate due to a strong and lower US advertising revenue.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), both high-flying tech stocks, continue to impress. Nvidia's powerful processors and AI growth story have catapulted it to become the world's fifth-largest company valued at $1.2tn. Amazon, on the other hand, heavily relies on its AWS cloud computing business but is currently facing an antitrust probe that threatens its core online shopping business.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (Facebook (NASDAQ: )) also demonstrate growth but are not without obstacles. Tesla's sales growth is under threat from competition from Chinese and global automakers, which leaves it with a PE over 70x. Meta's ambitious metaverse strategy and potential WhatsApp advertising slots may not pay off as expected.

Despite these impressive performances, investors are cautioned against betting on overhyped stocks at high valuations, especially in the current economic climate of high inflation and interest rates. While AI applications, like Nvidia chips and Meta's large language model, LLaMa, show promise, their market value will ultimately depend on the actual consumer benefits and realized productivity improvements.

The UK equity market only represents 3.9% of the global index with a PE ratio of 10x. This comes as a stark contrast to the performance of tech companies, especially in a year where technology stocks have outperformed other sectors.

The dotcom bubble serves as a reminder to investors that enthusiasm can outpace reward. As the tech industry continues to evolve and face challenges, it remains to be seen how these companies will adjust their strategies to maintain growth and profitability.

2022-10-18, IANS,"Google unveils new accessibility tools for Maps, Search, Chrome",https://in.investing.com/news/google-unveils-new-accessibility-tools-for-maps-search-chrome-3855015,"New Delhi, Oct 18 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has rolled out new accessibility features and updates on Maps, Search and Chrome to help people accomplish daily tasks faster and easier.A new identity attribute for the disability community is now available on Google Maps and Search, giving customers more details about a business and providing merchants an option to self-identify as a member of the community.

“This update builds on our existing business attributes, including Asian-owned, Black-owned, Latino-owned, LGBTQ+ owned, veteran-owned, and women-owned,” said Eve Andersson, senior director, Products for All at Google.

Lens in Maps (formerly known as Search with Live View) uses AI and augmented reality to help people use their phone’s camera to orient themselves in an unfamiliar neighbourhood and discover new places.

To make this more accessible and useful for people who are blind or low-vision, screen reader capabilities in Lens in Maps will be coming to iOS starting Tuesday, and to Android later this year.

“With the option to request wheelchair-accessible walking routes rolling out globally on iOS and Android wherever we have data available, you can get stair-free routes when you request walking directions in Maps,” said Andersson.

This feature builds on the wheelchair-accessible transit navigation option in Maps that shows people step-free transit routes.

Earlier this year, Google made it easy for everyone to find wheelchair-accessible places on Google Maps for Android and iOS.

Now, the company is starting to bring that information to business and place pages on Maps for Android Auto and cars with Google built in.

When you search for a place in Google Maps and click on it, a wheelchair icon will appear if the destination has a step-free entrance, accessible restrooms, parking or seating.

Earlier this year, Google introduced a new feature in the Chrome address bar that detects typos and displays suggested websites based on what Chrome thinks you meant.

“This feature is expanding to Chrome on Android and iOS, so you have the same experience across all your devices,” said the company.

For low-vision community, with Magnifier, you can use your camera to zoom in on something as you would using a physical magnifying glass.

The app can also improve the legibility of text whether you’re reading a menu or a document with the ability to adjust controls, including colour filters, brightness and contrast.

Magnifier is available on Google Play for Pixel 5 and up, excluding the Pixel Fold.

The ‘Guided Frame’ feature now recognises more than just faces, so you can use your front and rear-facing camera to take photos of your pets, dinner or even documents.

This update is already available on Pixel 8 and 8 Pro and rolling out to Pixel 6+ later this year, said the company.

2022-10-17, Investing.com,"Google, Qualcomm partner for RISC-V based Snapdragon Wear chipset",https://in.investing.com/news/google-qualcomm-partner-for-riscv-based-snapdragon-wear-chipset-93CH-3854585,"In a strategic partnership, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) are jointly developing a RISC-V based Snapdragon Wear chipset, aiming to enhance the functionality of future Wear OS watches. The collaboration was disclosed on Tuesday and is expected to result in custom cores, superior performance, and low power consumption for the wearable devices.

This development comes on the heels of the Pixel Watch 2 launch, which is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 processor. As part of their joint venture, Google and Qualcomm are also working towards establishing a robust software ecosystem and compatible apps for the first commercial RISC-V powered Wear OS watches. However, no specific launch date for these products has been provided yet.

RISC-V is an open-source alternative to Arm architecture that could potentially lead to cost savings for consumers due to its open nature. Google's official support for RISC-V in Android, announced in December 2022, along with a roadmap for its implementation, suggests a shift towards this architecture in the tech industry.

The move by Qualcomm and Google appears to be a strategic response to potential changes in Arm's licensing model, which could require device manufacturers to pay royalties based on device value. This partnership signifies a significant stride in wearable tech advancement as it aims to expedite the smartwatch production process for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).

As revealed by The Next Web, Qualcomm's engineering of a RISC-V-based platform for Google's Wear OS will augment its Snapdragon Wear line that predominantly powers Wear OS devices. The innovative chip architecture of RISC-V brings performance and power advantages to wearable technology. Consequently, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear platform innovations are set to rapidly evolve the Wear OS ecosystem.

2022-10-17, Investing.com,Qualcomm and Google Shift Focus to RISC-V for Next-Gen Wearables,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-and-google-shift-focus-to-riscv-for-nextgen-wearables-93CH-3854421,"In a significant shift from their previous reliance on Arm, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) announced on Tuesday their plan to transition to the open-source RISC-V architecture for their forthcoming wearable devices. The companies are collaborating on the Snapdragon Wear platform that will utilize the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) for next-generation Wear OS products.

Qualcomm, a major customer of Arm that paid over $2.7 billion in royalties in 2021 and used Arm's IP to design its Snapdragon chips, has now invested in a new company to advance RISC-V hardware development. This move comes after a lawsuit by Arm against Qualcomm over Nuvia's design earlier this year.

Google, which uses Arm's IP in its custom Tensor chip in Pixel smartphones and data centers, has also shown a clear intent towards RISC-V. It was demonstrated by the release of an early Android OS that supports it. An Android Authority survey revealed that about half of the respondents would consider a RISC-V phone if it matches the performance of current devices.

The joint venture includes Qualcomm creating custom RISC-V-based solutions that will serve the entire Google Wear OS ecosystem. Qualcomm is tasked with developing RISC-V-based hardware for wearable technology, while Google oversees software development for these devices. The initial focus is on smartwatches, with the potential for more advanced technology down the line.

Bjorn Kilburn from Google and Dino Bekis from Qualcomm have both expressed enthusiasm about this project. By switching to RISC-V cores, there's potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate licensing fees to Arm. It's not clear whether Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear platform featuring RISC-V ISA will replace all Arm cores or only select ones.

InvestingPro data shows that Qualcomm has a market cap of 124.3B USD and operates with a P/E ratio of 14.27, indicating a relatively low valuation compared to earnings. The company has also managed to maintain a positive return on assets of 17.94%, highlighting its efficiency in using its assets to generate earnings. According to InvestingPro Tips, Qualcomm has a strong track record of raising its dividend for 21 consecutive years, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors.

Companies like Tenstorrent, RISC-V, Ventana Microsystems, Andes Technologies, and Esperanto Technologies are shaping the RISC-V CPU landscape to challenge Arm with a more flexible, lower-cost, and open platform. Both Qualcomm and Google have joined the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE).

Despite Arm's significant performance edge and billions of Arm-powered devices worldwide, the growing interest in RISC-V suggests its potential as a viable alternative for SoC designers. Qualcomm's decision to apply the Snapdragon brand to the RISC-V SoC(s) represents a major shift from their previous Arm-only approach.

It will likely take several more years for RISC-V to reach parity with Arm, with second-tier providers like Huawei potentially leading the way. Despite Arm's dominance, companies like Tensorrent and Esperanto see far more opportunity in the data center with RISC-V.

The tech giant released its 'Legislative Framework to Protect Children and Teens Online' that came as more lawmakers, like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), pushed for the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill intended to protect kids from dangerous content online.

Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs, Google and Alphabet, said the framework outlines some principles for laws seeking to improve online experiences and keep children and teens safer when using the Internet.

“We hope that sharing our experiences and perspectives will advance the work of the policymakers and experts addressing these issues, and we look forward to engaging constructively with them,"" Walker said late on Monday.

The company said it agrees with public health and mental health experts that technology companies have a responsibility to design and build better online experiences.

“As policymakers contemplate these issues, they should carefully consider the broader impacts of these bills and avoid side effects like blocking access to critical services, requiring people (including adults) to submit unnecessary identification or sensitive personal information, or treating an older teen the same as a younger child,” Google argued.

Lawmakers in the US have called on tech companies to stop targeting ads to kids.

In its framework, Google says platforms should ban the practice “for those under 18"".

YouTube published its own set of principles for protecting kids on Monday, laying out how the platform implements some of the guidance from Google’s policy framework.

In a blog post, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said the platform doesn’t serve personalised ads to kids and provides parents with a set of family controls.

Google (NASDAQ: ) has also been issued a formal warning.In a statement, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the proliferation of online child sexual exploitation is a growing problem both in Australia and globally, and technology companies have a moral responsibility in protecting children from sexual exploitation and abuse being stored, shared and perpetrated on their services.

“Twitter/X has stated publicly that tackling child sexual exploitation is the number 1 priority for the company, but it can’t just be empty talk, we need to see words backed up with tangible action,” Grant said late on Sunday.

X has 28 days to respond to or pay the eSafety office’s fine.

“Our first reportfeaturing Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Skype, Snap, WhatsApp and Omegle uncovered serious shortfalls in how these companies were tackling this issue,” she stressed.

“This latest report also reveals similar gaps in how these five tech companies are dealing with the problem and how they are tackling the rise in sexual extortion and we need them all to do better,” Grant added.

eSafety found that two providers, Twitter/X and Google, did not comply with the notices given to them, with both companies failing to adequately respond to a number of questions in their respective notices.

Google has been issued a formal warning, notifying it of its failure to comply due to the company providing a number of generic responses to specific questions and providing aggregated information when asked questions about specific services.

“Google is not using its own technology to detect known child sexual exploitation videos on some of its services -- Gmail, Chat, Messages,” the report mentioned.

Twitter/X’s non-compliance was found to be more serious with the company failing to provide any response to some questions, leaving some sections entirely blank.

The Musk-owned company also failed to adequately answer questions relating to the number of safety and public policy staff still employed at Twitter/X following the October 2022 acquisition and subsequent job cuts.

“If Twitter chooses not to pay the infringement notice, it is open to the Commissioner to take other action. eSafety has also published a statement, called a service provider notification, about the non-compliance by Twitter/X,” said Grant.

“Twitter/X has stated publicly that tackling child sexual exploitation is the number 1 priority for the company, but it can’t just be empty talk, we need to see words backed up with tangible action,” she added.

While YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are taking steps to detect child sexual exploitation in livestreams, Discord is not, saying it is ‘prohibitively expensive’. Twitter/X did not provide the information required.

Pixel 8 Pro is packed with updated cameras, new sensors and helpful features, powered by Google Tensor G3 chip and new Android 14.

Let us see what makes this device a definitive Android upgrade in the festive season.

Pixel 8 Pro’s 6.7-inch Super Actua display features its brightest display yet. In in direct sunlight, you’ll love how true-to-life your Ultra-HDR images will look.

It also has a matte glass back with a polished aluminum frame and comes in three colours: Porcelain, Bay and Obsidian.

On the back of the Pixel 8 Pro, a new temperature sensor lets you quickly scan an object to get its temperature.

Use it to check if your pan is hot enough to start cooking, or find the temperature of your favourite noodle bowl you are going to relish.

Here are are top 4 Photos features on Pixel 8 Pro that you will just love to experience.

If you’re trying to take a group photo, even if you take multiple shots, chances are someone is always looking away or blinking.

The ‘Best Take’ feature uses a series of similar photos taken close together to help you automatically create a blended image with everyone’s best expression.

If you prefer another expression, you can manually select another look from the other photos you took to get the group photo you want.

The 'Magic Editor’ editing experience is now available on Google Photos, that uses generative AI to help you easily make complex edits and bring your photos in line with how you remember a moment.

Just tap or circle the object you want to edit, then drag to reposition it or pinch to resize it. You can also use contextual suggestions to improve the lighting and background, like changing a gray sky to a golden-hour sunset.

After you select an edit, Magic Editor will give you multiple result options to choose from so you can get the look you want.

Much like unwanted photobombers in your photos, distracting background noises in your videos pull focus from what you’re trying to capture.

Using advanced machine learning models, Audio Magic Eraser can identify sounds — like people talking in the background, music or wind — and sort them into distinct layers that you can control.

With Zoom Enhance coming later to Pixel 8 Pro, you can zoom in on any photo after the fact and crop to what you want the focus of your photo to be.

Now, let us come to videos.

The device offers flagship 50MP main camera, with 21 per cent more light sensitivity than the Pixel 7 series for the best low-light photos and videos on a Pixel.

Compared to Pixel 7 Pro, the 48 MP ultrawide lens gathers 105 per cent more light and focuses 30 per cent closer for improved Macro Focus shots with amazing aesthetic blur.

To top it off, the 48 MP telephoto lens gives you even cleaner zoomed-in shots in low-light settings even at 10x with optical quality.

Dual Exposure technology is available on the new main camera. It makes videos sharper and less grainy in scenes with the toughest lighting, like a sunset backdrop.

Dual Exposure effectively takes two images simultaneously — one optimised for low-light and the other for high dynamic range. The result is natural-looking videos with vivid colour and low noise.

Processing a one-minute 4K video at 30 frames per second will be the same as processing 1,800 photos.

When you use Video Boost on Pixel 8 Pro, you’ll still receive a high-quality video, but the video will also upload to the cloud where computational photography models are applied to your entire video.

This process also makes Night Sight Video possible for the first time on Pixel, so you can create memories in low-light situations where you couldn’t before (Remember that both these video features are coming later this year).

With improved AI, Call Screen now helps you receive 50 per cent fewer spam calls on average.

Also, seven years of software updates will keep you and your personal information secure on Pixel 8 Pro.

The Pixel 8 Pro costs Rs 106,999 and is available for purchase on Flipkart, with exciting select banks and exchange offers.

Conclusion: The elegant Pixel 8 Pro no doubt elevates the premium smartphone experience with never-seen-before, AI-driven features that makes your images and videos look stunning and just perfect.

It is a similar feature which Google's competitor Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) offered in Bing Chat using OpenAI’s DALL-E model since March.

Additionally, Google will now allow users to write drafts within SGE and customise the output by changing the length or tone of the writing.

""As we continue to experiment with bringing generative AI capabilities into Search, we’re testing new ways to get more done as you’re searching -- like creating an image that can bring an idea to life, or getting help on a written draft when you need a starting point,"" Google said in a blogpost on Thursday.

As explained by the company, if users search for something like “draw a picture of a capybara wearing a chef’s hat and cooking breakfast”, SGE will provide up to four generated images in the results.

By tapping on any of those images they will see how generative AI has expanded their initial query with descriptive details.

The image generation capability is only available in English in the US, to people who opted into the SGE experiment and who are 18 years or older, Google said.

The tech giant also has an upcoming tool called 'About this image' that will help people easily assess the context and credibility of images.

The company has built safeguards into the Search experience and blocked the creation of images that run counter to their prohibited use policy for generative AI, including harmful or misleading content.

2022-10-17, Investing.com,"Google, Qualcomm partner for RISC-V based Snapdragon Wear chipset",https://in.investing.com/news/google-qualcomm-partner-for-riscv-based-snapdragon-wear-chipset-93CH-3854585,"In a strategic partnership, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) are jointly developing a RISC-V based Snapdragon Wear chipset, aiming to enhance the functionality of future Wear OS watches. The collaboration was disclosed on Tuesday and is expected to result in custom cores, superior performance, and low power consumption for the wearable devices.

This development comes on the heels of the Pixel Watch 2 launch, which is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 processor. As part of their joint venture, Google and Qualcomm are also working towards establishing a robust software ecosystem and compatible apps for the first commercial RISC-V powered Wear OS watches. However, no specific launch date for these products has been provided yet.

RISC-V is an open-source alternative to Arm architecture that could potentially lead to cost savings for consumers due to its open nature. Google's official support for RISC-V in Android, announced in December 2022, along with a roadmap for its implementation, suggests a shift towards this architecture in the tech industry.

The move by Qualcomm and Google appears to be a strategic response to potential changes in Arm's licensing model, which could require device manufacturers to pay royalties based on device value. This partnership signifies a significant stride in wearable tech advancement as it aims to expedite the smartwatch production process for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs).

As revealed by The Next Web, Qualcomm's engineering of a RISC-V-based platform for Google's Wear OS will augment its Snapdragon Wear line that predominantly powers Wear OS devices. The innovative chip architecture of RISC-V brings performance and power advantages to wearable technology. Consequently, Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear platform innovations are set to rapidly evolve the Wear OS ecosystem.

2022-10-17, Investing.com,Qualcomm and Google Shift Focus to RISC-V for Next-Gen Wearables,https://in.investing.com/news/qualcomm-and-google-shift-focus-to-riscv-for-nextgen-wearables-93CH-3854421,"In a significant shift from their previous reliance on Arm, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) announced on Tuesday their plan to transition to the open-source RISC-V architecture for their forthcoming wearable devices. The companies are collaborating on the Snapdragon Wear platform that will utilize the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) for next-generation Wear OS products.

Qualcomm, a major customer of Arm that paid over $2.7 billion in royalties in 2021 and used Arm's IP to design its Snapdragon chips, has now invested in a new company to advance RISC-V hardware development. This move comes after a lawsuit by Arm against Qualcomm over Nuvia's design earlier this year.

Google, which uses Arm's IP in its custom Tensor chip in Pixel smartphones and data centers, has also shown a clear intent towards RISC-V. It was demonstrated by the release of an early Android OS that supports it. An Android Authority survey revealed that about half of the respondents would consider a RISC-V phone if it matches the performance of current devices.

The joint venture includes Qualcomm creating custom RISC-V-based solutions that will serve the entire Google Wear OS ecosystem. Qualcomm is tasked with developing RISC-V-based hardware for wearable technology, while Google oversees software development for these devices. The initial focus is on smartwatches, with the potential for more advanced technology down the line.

Bjorn Kilburn from Google and Dino Bekis from Qualcomm have both expressed enthusiasm about this project. By switching to RISC-V cores, there's potential to significantly reduce or even eliminate licensing fees to Arm. It's not clear whether Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear platform featuring RISC-V ISA will replace all Arm cores or only select ones.

InvestingPro data shows that Qualcomm has a market cap of 124.3B USD and operates with a P/E ratio of 14.27, indicating a relatively low valuation compared to earnings. The company has also managed to maintain a positive return on assets of 17.94%, highlighting its efficiency in using its assets to generate earnings. According to InvestingPro Tips, Qualcomm has a strong track record of raising its dividend for 21 consecutive years, making it an attractive option for income-focused investors.

Companies like Tenstorrent, RISC-V, Ventana Microsystems, Andes Technologies, and Esperanto Technologies are shaping the RISC-V CPU landscape to challenge Arm with a more flexible, lower-cost, and open platform. Both Qualcomm and Google have joined the RISC-V Software Ecosystem (RISE).

Despite Arm's significant performance edge and billions of Arm-powered devices worldwide, the growing interest in RISC-V suggests its potential as a viable alternative for SoC designers. Qualcomm's decision to apply the Snapdragon brand to the RISC-V SoC(s) represents a major shift from their previous Arm-only approach.

It will likely take several more years for RISC-V to reach parity with Arm, with second-tier providers like Huawei potentially leading the way. Despite Arm's dominance, companies like Tensorrent and Esperanto see far more opportunity in the data center with RISC-V.

“Starting January 2, 2024, Drive will start serving downloads without requiring third-party cookies,” the company said in an update.

If you have specific workflows in place that rely on Drive’s download URLs or use an app which relies on Drive’s download URLs, you’ll need to switch to the Drive and Docs publishing flows by January 2.

The change comes as Google prepares to disable third-party cookies by default in its Chrome browser, following similar action by Mozilla and Apple (NASDAQ: ) to enhance privacy.

“Serving downloads without requiring third-party cookies will work to improve usability, security, and privacy for Drive users,” said Google.

“For Workspace files (Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms file types) use the Google Docs publishing URL of the file,” the company added.

The change impacts all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google accounts.

In June, the company announced to end support for ""Drive for desktop"" on Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 and all 32-bit versions of Windows.

The company further said that users of a 32-bit version of Windows can still access Google Drive through a browser.

Meanwhile, the company had introduced a ""search chips"" feature for Drive, which allows users to filter by criteria like file type, owner and last modified date anywhere in the web app.

The tech giant released its 'Legislative Framework to Protect Children and Teens Online' that came as more lawmakers, like Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), pushed for the Kids Online Safety Act, a bill intended to protect kids from dangerous content online.

Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs, Google and Alphabet, said the framework outlines some principles for laws seeking to improve online experiences and keep children and teens safer when using the Internet.

“We hope that sharing our experiences and perspectives will advance the work of the policymakers and experts addressing these issues, and we look forward to engaging constructively with them,"" Walker said late on Monday.

The company said it agrees with public health and mental health experts that technology companies have a responsibility to design and build better online experiences.

“As policymakers contemplate these issues, they should carefully consider the broader impacts of these bills and avoid side effects like blocking access to critical services, requiring people (including adults) to submit unnecessary identification or sensitive personal information, or treating an older teen the same as a younger child,” Google argued.

Lawmakers in the US have called on tech companies to stop targeting ads to kids.

In its framework, Google says platforms should ban the practice “for those under 18"".

YouTube published its own set of principles for protecting kids on Monday, laying out how the platform implements some of the guidance from Google’s policy framework.

In a blog post, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said the platform doesn’t serve personalised ads to kids and provides parents with a set of family controls.

Google (NASDAQ: ) has also been issued a formal warning.In a statement, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the proliferation of online child sexual exploitation is a growing problem both in Australia and globally, and technology companies have a moral responsibility in protecting children from sexual exploitation and abuse being stored, shared and perpetrated on their services.

“Twitter/X has stated publicly that tackling child sexual exploitation is the number 1 priority for the company, but it can’t just be empty talk, we need to see words backed up with tangible action,” Grant said late on Sunday.

X has 28 days to respond to or pay the eSafety office’s fine.

“Our first reportfeaturing Apple (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Skype, Snap, WhatsApp and Omegle uncovered serious shortfalls in how these companies were tackling this issue,” she stressed.

“This latest report also reveals similar gaps in how these five tech companies are dealing with the problem and how they are tackling the rise in sexual extortion and we need them all to do better,” Grant added.

eSafety found that two providers, Twitter/X and Google, did not comply with the notices given to them, with both companies failing to adequately respond to a number of questions in their respective notices.

Google has been issued a formal warning, notifying it of its failure to comply due to the company providing a number of generic responses to specific questions and providing aggregated information when asked questions about specific services.

“Google is not using its own technology to detect known child sexual exploitation videos on some of its services -- Gmail, Chat, Messages,” the report mentioned.

Twitter/X’s non-compliance was found to be more serious with the company failing to provide any response to some questions, leaving some sections entirely blank.

The Musk-owned company also failed to adequately answer questions relating to the number of safety and public policy staff still employed at Twitter/X following the October 2022 acquisition and subsequent job cuts.

“If Twitter chooses not to pay the infringement notice, it is open to the Commissioner to take other action. eSafety has also published a statement, called a service provider notification, about the non-compliance by Twitter/X,” said Grant.

“Twitter/X has stated publicly that tackling child sexual exploitation is the number 1 priority for the company, but it can’t just be empty talk, we need to see words backed up with tangible action,” she added.

While YouTube, TikTok and Twitch are taking steps to detect child sexual exploitation in livestreams, Discord is not, saying it is ‘prohibitively expensive’. Twitter/X did not provide the information required.

It is a similar feature which Google's competitor Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) offered in Bing Chat using OpenAI’s DALL-E model since March.

Additionally, Google will now allow users to write drafts within SGE and customise the output by changing the length or tone of the writing.

""As we continue to experiment with bringing generative AI capabilities into Search, we’re testing new ways to get more done as you’re searching -- like creating an image that can bring an idea to life, or getting help on a written draft when you need a starting point,"" Google said in a blogpost on Thursday.

As explained by the company, if users search for something like “draw a picture of a capybara wearing a chef’s hat and cooking breakfast”, SGE will provide up to four generated images in the results.

By tapping on any of those images they will see how generative AI has expanded their initial query with descriptive details.

The image generation capability is only available in English in the US, to people who opted into the SGE experiment and who are 18 years or older, Google said.

The tech giant also has an upcoming tool called 'About this image' that will help people easily assess the context and credibility of images.

The company has built safeguards into the Search experience and blocked the creation of images that run counter to their prohibited use policy for generative AI, including harmful or misleading content.

2022-10-12, AMBCrypto,Can Australia’s new digital payment rules influence crypto sector,https://in.investing.com/news/can-australias-new-digital-payment-rules-influence-crypto-sector-3847036,"The proposal was in response to the rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay and Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

The Australian government seeks to regulate non-bank digital payment wallets and transactions in the country to modern standards.

This development was in response to the remarkable rise in popularity of digital payment networks, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and WeChat Pay. Notably, these proposed regulations could have a profound impact on the cryptocurrency landscape in Australia.

Digital payment platforms have experienced exponential growth, witnessing a surge in transaction volumes from 29.2 million in 2018 to a staggering 2.4 billion in 2022.

As the country grapples with this evolving financial landscape, the government is looking to modernize the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act (PSRA) of 1988. The proposed changes look to expand the definitions of essential terms like “payment system” and “participant.”

Traditional financial systems to gain more push Under the current regulatory framework, Australia’s Reserve Bank is the sole authority. However, the proposed modifications introduce civil penalty provisions, “enforceable undertakings,” and an increase in maximum criminal penalties where applicable. What makes this development particularly noteworthy is its potential implications for the cryptocurrency sector.

Although digital wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay generally require connections to regulated bank accounts and credit cards, transactions involving digital wallets currently exist outside the realm of Australia’s financial regulations and banking systems.

These changes could potentially bring digital payment networks closer to the purview of financial regulations and authorities.

A game changer for the Australian crypto market? The revised regulatory framework does not explicitly mention digital currencies or blockchain technology. However, the broader definitions of terms like “funds” and “payment system” could potentially encompass digital assets like cryptocurrencies if the government deems it necessary.

In many countries, including Australia, cryptocurrencies are primarily used for speculative trading, with limited adoption for consumer purchases. These regulations may signal a shift in how cryptocurrencies are treated within the regulatory landscape.

The motivations behind the government’s decision to enact these regulatory changes have sparked several theories.

One suggests that governments naturally seek increased surveillance and control, extending these powers to encompass payments outside the traditional banking system. This could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency sector, as it operates outside the traditional financial framework.

Another perspective points to the banking sector’s desire for greater transparency regarding technology giants’ fee structures and transaction statistics. As digital payments become more prevalent, large banks are looking to maintain their competitive edge.

However, it is to be noted that Australia’s approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain has historically been favorable, with cryptocurrencies like recognized as legal and treated as property. Cryptocurrencies can be traded, spent, received, and stored in the country. It is also accepted as a means of payment for personal and business transactions. However, merchants are not obligated to accept them.

Additionally, the government is taking steps to develop a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector. The main focus is on consumer protection and market integrity."

2022-10-11, IANS,US judge tosses out $32.5 mn verdict against Google in Sonos case,https://in.investing.com/news/us-judge-tosses-out-325-mn-verdict-against-google-in-sonos-case-3844850,"San Francisco, Oct 11 (IANS) A US judge has tossed out an earlier $32.5 million verdict against Google (NASDAQ: ) in a long-running legal battle with high-tech audio technology company Sonos.In May this year, a court in the US had ordered Google to pay $32.5 million to Sonos, for infringing on the company's smart speaker patent.

In the latest decision, US District Judge William Alsup said that Sonos had wrongfully linked its patent applications for multi-room audio technology to a 2006 application, in order to make them appear older and claim that its inventions came before Google’s products.

“Sonos filed the provisional application from which the patents in suit claim priority in 2006, but it did not file the applications for these patents and present the asserted claims for examination until 2019,” the decision read.

“In fact, in 2014, five years before Sonos filed the applications and presented the claims, accused infringer Google LLC shared with Sonos a plan for a product that would practice what would become the claimed invention,” the decision added.

“Google then began introducing its own products that practiced the invention in 2015. Even so, Sonos waited until 2019 to pursue claims on the invention (and until 2020 to roll out the invention in its own product line),” it further read.

Sonos called the ruling “wrong on both the facts and the law” and a “temporary setback”.

Google said in a statement late on Tuesday that Sonos has been running a years-long, misleading campaign against helpful features in the Google Home devices and smart speaker devices on spurious patent grounds.

“A federal judge ruled firmly in favour of our products, rejecting two of Sonos’ patents, building on previous rulings that invalidated the asserted claims from another two of Sonos’ patents. The decision shows the weakness of a central plank of Sonos’ campaign,” said Halimah DeLaine Prado, General Counsel at Google.

The court stated that Sonos’ patents are both invalid -- meaning they never should have been granted in the first place -- and unenforceable, and affirmed that we developed the technology first and independently.

“This decision is good news for our users who will once again be able to seamlessly group and integrate Google smart speakers, and for continued innovation of new features across the industry,” said Google.

2022-10-11, IANS,US judge tosses out $32.5 mn verdict against Google in Sonos case,https://in.investing.com/news/us-judge-tosses-out-325-mn-verdict-against-google-in-sonos-case-3844850,"San Francisco, Oct 11 (IANS) A US judge has tossed out an earlier $32.5 million verdict against Google (NASDAQ: ) in a long-running legal battle with high-tech audio technology company Sonos.In May this year, a court in the US had ordered Google to pay $32.5 million to Sonos, for infringing on the company's smart speaker patent.

In the latest decision, US District Judge William Alsup said that Sonos had wrongfully linked its patent applications for multi-room audio technology to a 2006 application, in order to make them appear older and claim that its inventions came before Google’s products.

“Sonos filed the provisional application from which the patents in suit claim priority in 2006, but it did not file the applications for these patents and present the asserted claims for examination until 2019,” the decision read.

“In fact, in 2014, five years before Sonos filed the applications and presented the claims, accused infringer Google LLC shared with Sonos a plan for a product that would practice what would become the claimed invention,” the decision added.

“Google then began introducing its own products that practiced the invention in 2015. Even so, Sonos waited until 2019 to pursue claims on the invention (and until 2020 to roll out the invention in its own product line),” it further read.

Sonos called the ruling “wrong on both the facts and the law” and a “temporary setback”.

Google said in a statement late on Tuesday that Sonos has been running a years-long, misleading campaign against helpful features in the Google Home devices and smart speaker devices on spurious patent grounds.

“A federal judge ruled firmly in favour of our products, rejecting two of Sonos’ patents, building on previous rulings that invalidated the asserted claims from another two of Sonos’ patents. The decision shows the weakness of a central plank of Sonos’ campaign,” said Halimah DeLaine Prado, General Counsel at Google.

The court stated that Sonos’ patents are both invalid -- meaning they never should have been granted in the first place -- and unenforceable, and affirmed that we developed the technology first and independently.

“This decision is good news for our users who will once again be able to seamlessly group and integrate Google smart speakers, and for continued innovation of new features across the industry,” said Google.

Microsoft's performance also lagged behind its tech peers. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., for instance, closed at $178.39, while Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc's Class C and Class A shares ended the day at $139.20 and $138.06 respectively.

In terms of trading volume, Microsoft recorded 20.5 million shares changing hands on Tuesday, marking a decrease of 417,476 from its 50-day average volume. The closing price was notably below its 52-week high of $366.78, which was reached on July 18th.

The recent trading performance of Microsoft has thus been marked by a divergence from both the wider market trend and the trajectory of its fellow technology companies.

Interestingly, Apple's trading volume remained under its typical 50-day average, indicating less trading activity for the tech giant's stocks than usual. This occurred even as broader markets were on the rise, suggesting that investors may be exercising caution with respect to Apple's shares despite overall market optimism.

The downturn in these tech stocks comes amidst a generally positive market, with both the NASDAQ Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing upward movements. However, it appears that even in a rising market, certain sectors or companies can experience declines, demonstrating the complex and multifaceted nature of stock market movements.

While this decline marks the end of a four-day winning streak for Apple, it remains to be seen how the company's stock will perform in the coming days and weeks ahead. With tech stocks showing some volatility despite broader market gains, investors will likely be keeping a close eye on these developments.

The firm partnered with marketing/analytics strategy consultants to survey 672 businesses to study how large enterprise decision-makers are viewing generative AI and their strategies, actions, and upcoming plans.

""Survey says Microsoft followed by Google are early leaders...while Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) are expected to narrow the gap,"" the analysts revealed.

""One of the top takeaways from the survey was Microsoft taking the early lead in the race with its OpenAI acquisition as the company has a significant AI monetization opportunity within Azure through Microsoft Co-Pilot while Google is also being viewed as a major Generative AI player now and down the road as it further improves Bard and its PaLM/LaMDA LLMs,"" the analysts added.

Wedbush said Microsoft and Google ""appear to be in the AI driver's seat,"" which they believe will be a battle over the next decade as they see other technology companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and other tech stalwarts collectively spending billions in the AI arms race over the coming years.

Earlier this month, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella admitted that the Bing search engine is not as good as Google, and becoming Apple’s default search engine could actually help Bing grow in the global search market.

Other search engines, like Yandex (1.5 per cent), Yahoo (1.2 per cent), Baidu (NASDAQ: ) (1.1 per cent), and DuckDuckGo (0.5 per cent), had smaller market shares.

By August, Google commanded a staggering 95.2 per cent of the global mobile search engine market, highlighting the tech giant's commitment to optimising the mobile search experience, according to the report.

Following Google, both Yandex and Baidu held 1.3 per cent of the market. Yahoo accounted for 0.6 per cent, while Bing and DuckDuckGo each captured 0.5 per cent.

Moreover, the report said that the US was the top source of the traffic to Google.com, with 26.7 per cent, while India (4.6 per cent), Brazil (4.4 per cent), the UK (3.9 per cent), and Japan (3.9 per cent) were other major contributors.

In July, Google.com had 85.3 billion visits, with visitors spending about 10 minutes on average. They viewed around 8.6 pages each time, with the bounce rate standing at 28.7 per cent.

The satisfaction score climbed 7 per cent, from 75 in 2022 to 80 in 2022. This rise highlights Google’s dedication to improving its search algorithms and user experience, the report mentioned.

Although 20 per cent growth is still “amazing especially when we're looking at millions, it's lower than the previous months which were in the 30s,” the report noted.

The upgraded ChatGPT+ subscription service costs $19.99 per month that offers faster response times, priority access at peak times and early access to new features and improvements.

“Our estimates show ChatGPT earned $3.2 million in September from the App Store and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play. That is net which means what OpenAI gets to keep after Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google take their fees,” Appfigures said in its report.

Around 15.6 million people downloaded OpenAI's ChatGPT app in September.

The official ChatGPT app from OpenAI has been on the App Store since May and Google Play since July.

The report said that with a few small tweaks, OpenAI can easily increase that conversion rate and see much faster revenue growth.

Last month, OpenAI said it expected to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2022.

The cost of running ChatGPT is prohibitively high for the company. According to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, each enquiry costs about 4 US cents.

If ChatGPT queries grew to a tenth the size of Google searches, it would require about $48.1 billion in GPUs initially and around $16 billion in chips per year to remain functioning.

Sam Altman-run OpenAI is also reportedly raising funds at a valuation of $80-$90 billion via sale of existing shares.

The decision, announced on Monday, comes in response to an appeal by both Google and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against a partially upheld CCI decision by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

The case originated from a Rs 1,337 crore fine imposed on Google by the CCI. It investigates claims of Google abusing its dominance in Android and online search markets. Several contentious issues are at the heart of this case, including the mandatory pre-installation of Google apps for Play Store licensing, manufacturers' rights in app selection and placement, restrictions on creating devices based on Android forks without Google apps, users' choice of default search engine, and prohibition on agreements that impede sales of devices running Android forks.

Following a divided victory at the NCLAT, both Google and CCI decided to challenge the partially upheld CCI decision at the Supreme Court level. The delay in hearing until January underscores the importance of this case and allows for thorough preparation to avoid clashes with other cases.

A bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra assured on Monday that they will list the case in the last week of January 2024.

""I will ensure that no other cases are listed then, so that the matter is over in a couple of days,"" the CJI said.

The CCI imposed a penalty of Rs 1,337.76 crore on Google for allegedly abusing its dominant position in multiple markets in the Android Mobile device ecosystem.

Earlier the apex court had refused to grant interim relief to Google, while the matter was pending before the NCLAT.

In January this year before hearing Google's plea, the NCLAT directed the tech giant to deposit 10 per cent of the CCI penalty.

In March, the NCLAT upheld the CCI's penalty on Google but set aside four key directions issued by the commission to the tech giant.

In October 2022, the CCI had penalised Google and directed it to desist from participating in anti-competitive practices and modify its conduct within a defined timeline.

This occurred even as broader markets were on the rise, suggesting that investors may be exercising caution with respect to Apple's shares despite overall market optimism.

However, it appears that even in a rising market, certain sectors or companies can experience declines, demonstrating the complex and multifaceted nature of stock market movements.

While this decline marks the end of a four-day winning streak for Apple, it remains to be seen how the company's stock will perform in the coming days and weeks ahead. With tech stocks showing some volatility despite broader market gains, investors will likely be keeping a close eye on these developments.

The firm partnered with marketing/analytics strategy consultants to survey 672 businesses to study how large enterprise decision-makers are viewing generative AI and their strategies, actions, and upcoming plans.

""Survey says Microsoft followed by Google are early leaders...while Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Meta (NASDAQ: ) are expected to narrow the gap,"" the analysts revealed.

""One of the top takeaways from the survey was Microsoft taking the early lead in the race with its OpenAI acquisition as the company has a significant AI monetization opportunity within Azure through Microsoft Co-Pilot while Google is also being viewed as a major Generative AI player now and down the road as it further improves Bard and its PaLM/LaMDA LLMs,"" the analysts added.

Wedbush said Microsoft and Google ""appear to be in the AI driver's seat,"" which they believe will be a battle over the next decade as they see other technology companies, such as Amazon, Meta, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and other tech stalwarts collectively spending billions in the AI arms race over the coming years.

""Our conclusions from this Wedbush Proprietary Enterprise Generative AI Survey are very positive for Google, Microsoft, and the myriad of tech players globally that are heavily investing in developing Generative AI products/solutions for enterprises as the use cases and monetization opportunities continue to rapidly grow,"" the analysts said."

Earlier this month, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella admitted that the Bing search engine is not as good as Google, and becoming Apple’s default search engine could actually help Bing grow in the global search market.

Other search engines, like Yandex (1.5 per cent), Yahoo (1.2 per cent), Baidu (NASDAQ: ) (1.1 per cent), and DuckDuckGo (0.5 per cent), had smaller market shares.

By August, Google commanded a staggering 95.2 per cent of the global mobile search engine market, highlighting the tech giant's commitment to optimising the mobile search experience, according to the report.

Following Google, both Yandex and Baidu held 1.3 per cent of the market. Yahoo accounted for 0.6 per cent, while Bing and DuckDuckGo each captured 0.5 per cent.

Moreover, the report said that the US was the top source of the traffic to Google.com, with 26.7 per cent, while India (4.6 per cent), Brazil (4.4 per cent), the UK (3.9 per cent), and Japan (3.9 per cent) were other major contributors.

In July, Google.com had 85.3 billion visits, with visitors spending about 10 minutes on average. They viewed around 8.6 pages each time, with the bounce rate standing at 28.7 per cent.

The satisfaction score climbed 7 per cent, from 75 in 2022 to 80 in 2022. This rise highlights Google’s dedication to improving its search algorithms and user experience, the report mentioned.

Although 20 per cent growth is still “amazing especially when we're looking at millions, it's lower than the previous months which were in the 30s,” the report noted.

The upgraded ChatGPT+ subscription service costs $19.99 per month that offers faster response times, priority access at peak times and early access to new features and improvements.

“Our estimates show ChatGPT earned $3.2 million in September from the App Store and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play. That is net which means what OpenAI gets to keep after Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Google take their fees,” Appfigures said in its report.

Around 15.6 million people downloaded OpenAI's ChatGPT app in September.

The official ChatGPT app from OpenAI has been on the App Store since May and Google Play since July.

The report said that with a few small tweaks, OpenAI can easily increase that conversion rate and see much faster revenue growth.

Last month, OpenAI said it expected to reach $1 billion in revenue in 2022.

The cost of running ChatGPT is prohibitively high for the company. According to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, each enquiry costs about 4 US cents.

If ChatGPT queries grew to a tenth the size of Google searches, it would require about $48.1 billion in GPUs initially and around $16 billion in chips per year to remain functioning.

Sam Altman-run OpenAI is also reportedly raising funds at a valuation of $80-$90 billion via sale of existing shares.

The decision, announced on Monday, comes in response to an appeal by both Google and the Competition Commission of India (CCI) against a partially upheld CCI decision by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).

The case originated from a Rs 1,337 crore fine imposed on Google by the CCI. It investigates claims of Google abusing its dominance in Android and online search markets. Several contentious issues are at the heart of this case, including the mandatory pre-installation of Google apps for Play Store licensing, manufacturers' rights in app selection and placement, restrictions on creating devices based on Android forks without Google apps, users' choice of default search engine, and prohibition on agreements that impede sales of devices running Android forks.

Following a divided victory at the NCLAT, both Google and CCI decided to challenge the partially upheld CCI decision at the Supreme Court level. The delay in hearing until January underscores the importance of this case and allows for thorough preparation to avoid clashes with other cases.

The company is known to yield high returns on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets. InvestingPro data indicates a P/E ratio of 29.1 and a revenue of 289.53B USD for Google.

A bench comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud and Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra assured on Monday that they will list the case in the last week of January 2024.

""I will ensure that no other cases are listed then, so that the matter is over in a couple of days,"" the CJI said.

The CCI imposed a penalty of Rs 1,337.76 crore on Google for allegedly abusing its dominant position in multiple markets in the Android Mobile device ecosystem.

Earlier the apex court had refused to grant interim relief to Google, while the matter was pending before the NCLAT.

In January this year before hearing Google's plea, the NCLAT directed the tech giant to deposit 10 per cent of the CCI penalty.

In March, the NCLAT upheld the CCI's penalty on Google but set aside four key directions issued by the commission to the tech giant.

In October 2022, the CCI had penalised Google and directed it to desist from participating in anti-competitive practices and modify its conduct within a defined timeline.

In August 2022, the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) launched a probe into Google Play and App Store for their enforcement of certain in-app payment methods and other irregularities against app developers.

Wrapping up the probe, the commission decided to impose a fine of 47.5 billion won on Google and 20.5 billion won on Apple based on the judgment that they violated the country's revised Telecommunications Business Act by abusing their monopoly power to force local publishers to use specific billing systems and unfairly postponing due app review, reports Yonhap news agency.

The commission also found that Apple's policy imposing fees for domestic app developers constitutes a discriminatory act.

The KCC called on the two companies to implement corrective measures, saying that their practices are a ""grave issue"" as it could highly likely hamper fair market competition.

The commission plans to finalise the fine after listening to the opinions of the companies and going through due deliberation procedures.

In 2021, the National Assembly passed a law that bans app store operators from forcing in-app payment systems on developers, making South Korea the first country in the world to introduce such curbs on in-app billing policies of Apple and Google.

""Since the start of the fact finding investigation in August 2022, we have worked closely with KCC to explain how we are complying with the new law whilst ensuring that through our alternative billing, we continue to provide a safe and high quality experience for all,"" Google said in a statement.

""What KCC has shared today is the 'pre-notice' and we will carefully review and submit our response. Once the final written decision is shared with us we will carefully review to evaluate the next course of action,"" it added.

Apple refuted the commission's conclusions, stressing that it has long worked closely with local app developers and played a role in building a sound local app ecosystem in South Korea.

Wrapping up the probe, the commission decided to impose a fine of 47.5 billion won on Google and 20.5 billion won on Apple based on the judgment that they violated the country's revised Telecommunications Business Act by abusing their monopoly power to force local publishers to use their in-app billing system and unfairly postponing due evaluation of apps.

The commission also found that Apple's policy imposing fees for domestic app developers constitutes a discriminatory act.

The KCC called on the two companies to implement corrective measures, saying that their practices are a ""grave issue"" as it could highly likely hamper fair market competition.

The commission plans to finalise the fine after listening to the opinions of the companies and going through due deliberation procedures.

Last year, the National Assembly passed a law that bans app store operators from forcing in-app payment systems on developers, making South Korea the first country in the world to introduce such curbs on in-app billing policies of Apple and Google.

Dominated by 'hyperscalers' Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Google (NASDAQ: ), these companies are now under scrutiny by regulatory bodies for practices that could harm competition and impact the UK economy.

The investigation was initiated by Ofcom under the Enterprise Act 2002 and is led by Fergal Farragher. The study reveals practices such as high egress fees, technical barriers to data portability, and committed spend discounts. These practices could potentially limit competitors from effectively challenging the market leaders due to the high profitability of AWS and Microsoft and the difficulty in customer switching.

Industries such as telecommunications, broadcasting, and public services that heavily rely on cloud computing could be impacted by these practices. Acknowledging the potential implications on the UK's digital economy, Ofcom has referred these concerns to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for a more detailed investigation.

The CMA investigation, led by Sarah Cardell, echoes similar probes into public sector cloud services in the EU. The responses from AWS and Microsoft to the findings have varied. While Microsoft has pledged commitment to competition, AWS disputed the findings and claimed no separate fees for switching providers.

These investigations underscore the essential role of cloud services in businesses and potential competitive harm. The outcome of this probe will decide whether action should be taken against these dominant players in the market.

The new Pixel phones will be supported with seven years of “OS, security, and Feature Drop updates”.Google also released Android 14, the latest version of the Android operating system which is available on Pixel phones (4A 5G and up), with phones from manufacturers including Samsung (KS: ), Nothing, OnePlus, and more supporting it “later this year.”

The new Google Pixel 8 starts at $699.99 for the 128GB storage model. Pixel 8 Pro with in-built temperature sensor starts from $999.

Both the devices can be pre-order now and will be available at the Google Store and retail partners, beginning October 12.

“If you pre-order a Pixel 8 Pro, you’ll get a Pixel Watch 2 on us,” said the company,

Pixel 8, with its contoured edges and smaller size than Pixel 7, has a 6.2-inch “Actua” display, which gives you real-world clarity and is 42 per cent brighter than Pixel 7’s display.

Pixel 8 features satin metal finishes, a polished glass back and comes in Rose, Hazel and Obsidian.

“On the back of the Pixel 8 Pro, a new temperature sensor lets you quickly scan an object to get its temperature. Use it to check if your pan is hot enough to start cooking or if the milk in your baby’s bottle is at the right temperature,” Google said.

The company has also submitted an application to the US FDA, to enable Pixel’s Thermometer App to take temperature and save it to Fitbit.

“We’re committing to providing seven years of software support for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, including the latest Android operating system, security updates and ongoing Feature Drops,” the company promised.

Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro feature powerful, upgraded camera systems for stunning photo and video quality, plus game-changing editing tools.

Every camera on the Pixel 8 Pro has been upgraded, starting with the main camera that captures better photos and videos in low-light settings.

The bigger ultrawide lens delivers even better Macro Focus, the telephoto lens captures 56 per cent more light and takes 10x photos at optical quality, and the front-facing camera now has autofocus for the best selfies on a Pixel phone.

“Magic Editor in Google Photos is a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you bring your photos in line with the essence of the moment you were trying to capture,” according to Google.

The new smartwatch, Google Pixel Watch 2, can be pre-ordered for $349 for Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, and $399 for 4G LTE. It will be available in 30 countries on October 12.

“Pixel Watch 2 comes with upgraded performance, all-day battery life (with always-on display), new safety features and sensors for deeper health insights — including our most accurate heart rate tracking on any tracker or smartwatch2 — to give you a much better pulse on your day,” said Google.

Pixel Watch 2 is made from 100 per cent recycled aluminum which makes it 10 per cent lighter than Pixel Watch3.

Together with the low-power co-processor, the new CPU gives the watch 24 hours of battery life, even with always-on display.

“Combined with a faster charging rate that powers your watch to 50 per cent in just 30 minutes, your Pixel Watch 2 can support your activities from day to night,” the company informed.

That is the view of BofA analysts, who revealed in a note Wednesday that both Google and Bing's market share declined in September.

""Statcounter's data indicates Google's search market share of 91.6% was slightly down in September, 27bps m/m and 84bps y/y, but remains relatively stable since ChatGPT launched late last year. In Sep, Bing search share also declined 2bps m/m to 3.0% and was down 44bps y/y, while Yandex was up 32bps m/m, capturing share gains from Google,"" explained the analysts, who maintained a Buy rating and $146 price target on GOOGL.

""For Global Web traffic, September Similarweb data suggests all major platforms saw m/m decline. Google traffic declined 10% m/m to 2.6bn, Bard traffic declined 30% m/m to 7.2mn, and Bing traffic declined 7% m/m to 37.4mn,"" they added.

The analysts noted that while September data suggests Google's web traffic remains relatively stable, they believe a modest overhang remains on potential search revenue disruption from AI/LLM integration.

Even so, BofA thinks that ""with increasing advertiser adoption of Performance Max, and the ramp of AI-driven products like dynamic keyword campaigns, AI will be incrementally positive to Google's ad sales in 2H’23.""

""We expect, with search growth accelerating, Google's core business will show strong margin leverage in 2H'23, and cost efficiencies in 2024 could drive upside to Street estimates,"" the analysts concluded."

Despite paying $44 billion for Twitter (now X) last year, he has maintained his wealth. This has been helped by a five-fold increase in the value of his rocket company SpaceX, which is now worth $150 billion after four years.

Nine of the top 20 are worth $100 billion or more, the most ever, and up from just four last year.

While Ellison ranked three with an estimated fortune of $158 billion, Forbes said that no one in America has become wealthier this year than him, who is $57 billion richer because of the generative AI craze boosting shares of his software company.

Google (NASDAQ: )'s co-founder Larry Page, who ranked fifth, got $21 billion richer this year due to a 26 per cent jump in the shares of its parent company Alphabet. His wealth is now estimated at $114 billion.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder Bill Gates, who was once the world's richest man, now sits at the sixth spot on America's list with an estimated fortune of $111 billion, while Page's Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, comes in at number seven with a fortune of $110 billion.

Meta (NASDAQ: ) Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent part of this year fending off Musk's challenge to a cage fight, but his early investment in AI has helped him consolidate his $106 billion fortune.

Gates' former right-hand man, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, ranks ninth with $101 billion.

This move, however, is not indicative of a large-scale layoff, as most team members have been retained for critical hiring roles. Alphabet has committed to assisting the affected employees in finding new roles either within the company or elsewhere.

The downsizing follows an earlier decision by Google to lay off 12,000 employees. Additionally, cuts were made in its Waze mapping app department, under the leadership of Chris Philips (AS: ). This was part of a broader initiative to integrate Waze into Google Maps.

Despite these changes, many former employees have taken to LinkedIn to share their post-layoff journeys, showcasing resilience and optimism. One standout example is a former employee who spent over five years at Google before moving to Austin. She expressed her positivity through a poem composed by Bard and highlighted her role in connecting with thousands of candidates and fostering community development among Googlers and Xooglers.

Alphabet's recent actions seem to reflect an ongoing process of strategic restructuring and resource allocation within the company.

The CMA investigation, led by Sarah Cardell, echoes similar probes into public sector cloud services in the EU. The responses from AWS and Microsoft to the findings have varied. While Microsoft has pledged commitment to competition, AWS disputed the findings and claimed no separate fees for switching providers.

These investigations underscore the essential role of cloud services in businesses and potential competitive harm. The outcome of this probe will decide whether action should be taken against these dominant players in the market.

2022-10-04, IANS,"AI-powered Google Pixel 8 phones bring new camera tools, 7 yrs of key updates",https://in.investing.com/news/aipowered-google-pixel-8-phones-bring-new-camera-tools-7-yrs-of-key-updates-3836277,"San Francisco, Oct 4 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday launched a new line-up of AI-powered Pixel 8 smartphones with new Tensor G3 chip, along with Pixel Watch 2. The new Pixel phones will be supported with seven years of “OS, security, and Feature Drop updates”.Google also released Android 14, the latest version of the Android operating system which is available on Pixel phones (4A 5G and up), with phones from manufacturers including Samsung (KS: ), Nothing, OnePlus, and more supporting it “later this year.”

The new Google Pixel 8 starts at $699.99 for the 128GB storage model. Pixel 8 Pro with in-built temperature sensor starts from $999.

Both the devices can be pre-order now and will be available at the Google Store and retail partners, beginning October 12.

“If you pre-order a Pixel 8 Pro, you’ll get a Pixel Watch 2 on us,” said the company,

Pixel 8, with its contoured edges and smaller size than Pixel 7, has a 6.2-inch “Actua” display, which gives you real-world clarity and is 42 per cent brighter than Pixel 7’s display.

Pixel 8 features satin metal finishes, a polished glass back and comes in Rose, Hazel and Obsidian.

“On the back of the Pixel 8 Pro, a new temperature sensor lets you quickly scan an object to get its temperature. Use it to check if your pan is hot enough to start cooking or if the milk in your baby’s bottle is at the right temperature,” Google said.

The company has also submitted an application to the US FDA, to enable Pixel’s Thermometer App to take temperature and save it to Fitbit.

“We’re committing to providing seven years of software support for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, including the latest Android operating system, security updates and ongoing Feature Drops,” the company promised.

Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro feature powerful, upgraded camera systems for stunning photo and video quality, plus game-changing editing tools.

Every camera on the Pixel 8 Pro has been upgraded, starting with the main camera that captures better photos and videos in low-light settings.

The bigger ultrawide lens delivers even better Macro Focus, the telephoto lens captures 56 per cent more light and takes 10x photos at optical quality, and the front-facing camera now has autofocus for the best selfies on a Pixel phone.

Pixel 8 has the same updated main camera, plus a new ultrawide lens that enables Macro Focus.

“Magic Editor in Google Photos is a new experimental editing experience that uses generative AI to help you bring your photos in line with the essence of the moment you were trying to capture,” according to Google.

Later this year, Pixel 8 Pro will get Video Boost, which pairs Tensor G3 with Google’s powerful data centres to apply cutting-edge processing to videos.

With improved AI, Call Screen will help users receive 50 per cent fewer spam calls on average.

The new smartwatch, Google Pixel Watch 2, can be pre-ordered for $349 for Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, and $399 for 4G LTE. It will be available in 30 countries on October 12.

“Pixel Watch 2 comes with upgraded performance, all-day battery life (with always-on display), new safety features and sensors for deeper health insights — including our most accurate heart rate tracking on any tracker or smartwatch2 — to give you a much better pulse on your day,” said Google.

Pixel Watch 2 is made from 100 per cent recycled aluminum which makes it 10 per cent lighter than Pixel Watch3.

Together with the low-power co-processor, the new CPU gives the watch 24 hours of battery life, even with always-on display.

“Combined with a faster charging rate that powers your watch to 50 per cent in just 30 minutes, your Pixel Watch 2 can support your activities from day to night,” the company informed.

That is the view of BofA analysts, who revealed in a note Wednesday that both Google and Bing's market share declined in September.

""Statcounter's data indicates Google's search market share of 91.6% was slightly down in September, 27bps m/m and 84bps y/y, but remains relatively stable since ChatGPT launched late last year. In Sep, Bing search share also declined 2bps m/m to 3.0% and was down 44bps y/y, while Yandex was up 32bps m/m, capturing share gains from Google,"" explained the analysts, who maintained a Buy rating and $146 price target on GOOGL.

""For Global Web traffic, September Similarweb data suggests all major platforms saw m/m decline. Google traffic declined 10% m/m to 2.6bn, Bard traffic declined 30% m/m to 7.2mn, and Bing traffic declined 7% m/m to 37.4mn,"" they added.

The analysts noted that while September data suggests Google's web traffic remains relatively stable, they believe a modest overhang remains on potential search revenue disruption from AI/LLM integration.

Even so, BofA thinks that ""with increasing advertiser adoption of Performance Max, and the ramp of AI-driven products like dynamic keyword campaigns, AI will be incrementally positive to Google's ad sales in 2H’23.""

""We expect, with search growth accelerating, Google's core business will show strong margin leverage in 2H'23, and cost efficiencies in 2024 could drive upside to Street estimates,"" the analysts concluded."

Despite paying $44 billion for Twitter (now X) last year, he has maintained his wealth. This has been helped by a five-fold increase in the value of his rocket company SpaceX, which is now worth $150 billion after four years.

Nine of the top 20 are worth $100 billion or more, the most ever, and up from just four last year.

While Ellison ranked three with an estimated fortune of $158 billion, Forbes said that no one in America has become wealthier this year than him, who is $57 billion richer because of the generative AI craze boosting shares of his software company.

Google (NASDAQ: )'s co-founder Larry Page, who ranked fifth, got $21 billion richer this year due to a 26 per cent jump in the shares of its parent company Alphabet. His wealth is now estimated at $114 billion.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) founder Bill Gates, who was once the world's richest man, now sits at the sixth spot on America's list with an estimated fortune of $111 billion, while Page's Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, comes in at number seven with a fortune of $110 billion.

Meta (NASDAQ: ) Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent part of this year fending off Musk's challenge to a cage fight, but his early investment in AI has helped him consolidate his $106 billion fortune.

Gates' former right-hand man, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, ranks ninth with $101 billion.

This move, however, is not indicative of a large-scale layoff, as most team members have been retained for critical hiring roles. Alphabet has committed to assisting the affected employees in finding new roles either within the company or elsewhere.

The downsizing follows an earlier decision by Google to lay off 12,000 employees. Additionally, cuts were made in its Waze mapping app department, under the leadership of Chris Philips (AS: ). This was part of a broader initiative to integrate Waze into Google Maps.

Despite these changes, many former employees have taken to LinkedIn to share their post-layoff journeys, showcasing resilience and optimism. One standout example is a former employee who spent over five years at Google before moving to Austin. She expressed her positivity through a poem composed by Bard and highlighted her role in connecting with thousands of candidates and fostering community development among Googlers and Xooglers.

Alphabet's recent actions seem to reflect an ongoing process of strategic restructuring and resource allocation within the company.

The feature will roll out gradually, starting with Android users and coming to web and iOS users over the next few months.

“On your Android device, express yourself and quickly respond to emails with emojis. In Gmail, you can find the emoji reaction option on each message,” the company said in an update.

This is how it works. On your Android phone or tablet, open the Gmail app.

“Open a message you want to reply to. Below the message, tap Add emoji reaction Insert emoji. From the picker, select an emoji you want to use. To display more emoji, select More . The emoji you select appears at the bottom of the email,” said Google.

To discover who reacted to an email, touch and hold the emoji reaction you want to check. To reuse the reaction someone else added to the email, tap the existing reaction chip.

Depending on your “Undo Send” settings in Gmail, you have from 5 up to 30 seconds to remove an emoji reaction after you add it.

To remove an emoji reaction, in the notification at the bottom of your message, tap Undo. You can only change the ""Undo Send"" period on your computer, according to Google.

There are a few restrictions though with sending emojis.

You won’t be able to use emoji reactions with your school or work accounts.

The emoji reactions also won’t be available if the message is sent to more than 20 people, to a group email list, if you’ve been bcc’d, and in a few other instances.

Most importantly, you won’t be able to react to a message if you’ve already sent more than 20 reactions to that message.

The announcement was made at the firm's annual conference on Tuesday, aiming to enhance its platform amid post-lockdown office returns and stiff competition from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).

Zoom's market capitalization stands at $20.48 billion, with a P/E ratio of 142.21, according to InvestingPro data. Despite a declining trend in earnings per share, as indicated by InvestingPro Tips, the company's free cash flow exceeds net income, showing high earnings quality. It's also noteworthy that Zoom holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing a solid financial footing for the company.

While Zoom's shares have remained stagnant compared to the S&P 500's 10% rise, the company's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Kelly Steckelberg, sees this new product as a step towards expanding Zoom's platform. This move comes as Zoom's stock price has often moved in the opposite direction of the market, as per InvestingPro Tips.

The move places Zoom in direct competition within the collaborative applications market, which is currently led by Microsoft with a 30% share, followed by Google with a 13.5%, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Zoom holds an 11% share in this market. The company's revenue for the last twelve months was $4463.74 million with a revenue growth of 3.92%, as per InvestingPro data.

The launch of 'Zoom Docs' comes at a time when Microsoft Teams has been drawing business away from Zoom's customer base. Despite this, Zoom reported a 7% increase in its enterprise customer base from the previous year, now standing at 218,100 enterprises. This is in line with the InvestingPro Tips prediction that Zoom's net income is expected to grow this year, and the company will be profitable.

2022-10-03, The News Crypto,"EU Gets Serious About Data, Cites Web3 Browser Extension Swash",https://in.investing.com/news/eu-gets-serious-about-data-cites-web3-browser-extension-swash-3834999,"The European Union strengthened its reputation as a no-nonsense regulator of data protection in recent weeks, after fining TikTok $379m for breaching its landmark GDPR privacy law.

The Chinese-owned social media giant was reprimanded for failing to protect children’s privacy, such as by making the accounts of users aged under 16 public by default. The action reiterates the aggressive approach of the EU’s lead regulator, the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), based in Ireland.

On September 18, the European Commission will conduct a high-level digital dialogue with China to facilitate EU-China communication on digital strategy and tech developments – though it’s unlikely China will be falling into lockstep with the bloc anytime soon. Thankfully, a recent EU report highlighted progress on innovative tech, such as Web3 tools, that could also bring substantial improvements in how data is managed by users.

EC Talks Up Swash Data Union in New Paper

The EU’s attitude to data privacy was outlined in a recent policy report published by the European Commission’s science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC).

Entitled ‘Mapping the landscape of data intermediaries: Emerging models for more inclusive data governance,’ the 75-page paper aims to promote ‘inclusive data governance’ by highlighting tools that let users wield greater control over the footprint they leave behind when browsing the internet.

One of the tools highlighted in the report was Swash, a data-focused web3 ecosystem comprising tools and solutions for both users and businesses. In a section on Data Unions, which protect and bargain on rights over personal data generated via platforms, Swash’s browser extension was cited as an example of a product that ‘allows data subjects to get power over their data while they receive a share of the profits they generate.’

It is not the first time Swash has been endorsed by those concerned with upholding data protection rights. Earlier this year, the platform passed a rigorous independent audit carried out by the Data & Marketing Association (DMA), becoming the only data union to be named an accredited member. Swash also completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office.

The EC’s mention of Swash doesn’t just highlight a commitment to exploring options consumers have to protect their data. It also underscores the Commission’s interest in emerging web3 technologies. Gradually, the web3 landscape is coming to be recognized as legitimate and disruptive in the eyes of governing bodies, hence the EU’s instituting of a formal regulatory framework for Crypto-Assets Issuers and Crypto-Asset Services Providers (the MiCA regulations).

Winds of Web3 Change Continue to Blow

It’s not just MiCA: the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), whose nodes are run by EU member states, recently presented at the European Blockchain Convention in Barcelona, where conversations centered on the advancement of decentralized governance (DeGov) services.

A subsequent article on the EC website suggested that Europe could:

“lead the way in the transition from Web 2.0’s BigTech platform model to a vibrant European Web3 ecosystem.”

Swash is an example of a web3 service, where all data transactions are denominated in $SWASH crypto tokens. What’s more, users can contribute the value of their data to social development causes and use it for value exchange through the Data for Good initiative.

While users get nothing from the sale of their data in the old web2 model dominated by Google (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and the rest, Swash ensures that 70% of profits made from data sales lands in their pockets. Advertisers can also use Swash to tackle ad fraud and wasted ad spend, and to serve up ads to fully opted-in, web3-minded users. The theory goes that if users have already given their browser permission to display ads (based on certain preferences) in return for rewards, they are more likely to engage with what is shown to them.

A new era of data protection is upon us, strictly enforced by regulators and propelled by a wave of innovative web3 data intermediaries promoting a fairer, more user-centric approach. Piece by piece, the data economy of the future is being assembled, and the centralized data control that characterized the previous model is being replaced by blockchain-native platforms, programmable privacy, decentralized data storage, and user-owned digital identities.

Although data privacy challenges remain, the evolution of web3 is changing the way data is collected, stored and shared – and putting consumers firmly in the driver’s seat."

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Alphabet's search division faces antitrust allegations over default search engine monopoly,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabets-search-division-faces-antitrust-allegations-over-default-search-engine-monopoly-93CH-3833510,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s search division, Google, is currently under scrutiny in a US antitrust trial. The company is accused of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless carriers to ensure its search engine remains the default option on mobile devices and web browsers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is leading the charge against Google, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). CEO Satya Nadella testifying on Monday.

Nadella dismissed Google's assertion that it is easy for users to change default search engine settings on mobile devices. He described the notion of choice in the search market as ""bogus,"" stating that Microsoft's efforts to make Bing the default search engine on iPhones encountered numerous roadblocks.

Last week, Jonathan Tinter, Microsoft's business development executive, testified that despite offering more favorable terms than Google and being willing to incur significant losses, Microsoft failed to secure a deal to make Bing the default search app on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s products. Instead, Apple renewed its agreement with Google. Tinter also revealed that Microsoft's Surface Duo smartphone was obligated to use Google search as part of its Android mobile operating system license agreement, limiting its ability to use Bing.

Nadella, who played a key role in developing Bing, testified about Microsoft's struggle to break into the online advertising market dominated by Google. Despite Bing gaining some ground on desktop computers through integration with Microsoft's Internet Explorer and later Edge browser, it has struggled on mobile devices where users predominantly use Google. Nadella stated: ""It's a hard game to make any breakthroughs, but no one can accuse us of not being persistent.""

The US government argues that Google has engaged in illegal payments of $10 billion annually to entities like Apple and wireless service providers such as AT&T (NYSE: ) to secure its position as the default search engine on their devices. Google, which controls approximately 90% of the search market and is valued at over $1 trillion, has denied these allegations. The company maintains that its dominance in the lucrative advertising sector is a result of product quality, not illegal practices.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Microsoft's struggle to compete with Google in search market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-struggle-to-compete-with-google-in-search-market-dominance-93CH-3833453,"The ongoing antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has brought to light the struggle of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: ) Bing search engine to compete with Google's dominance in the market. The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, testified on Monday, shedding light on the company's efforts and challenges.

Despite investing $100 billion into Bing, Nadella acknowledged its position as a ""very, very low share player"" in the search market. He explained that Microsoft continues to persist with Bing because they view it as a software category they can contribute to, even though it has been challenging to make significant breakthroughs.

Adding to the complexity of the competition is the role of artificial intelligence (AI). Google began incorporating its AI software, Bard, into its search engine in March. Nadella stated that Google could extend its lead by using the substantial profits from its search business to secure exclusive rights to content that could enhance its search AI, thereby outperforming rivals.

The U.S. Department of Justice accuses Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) search division of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to ensure that its search engine remains the default option. Google denies these allegations. The government is using Microsoft's struggle with Bing as evidence that even with substantial resources, it is difficult to challenge Google's dominance.

Nadella also revealed that Microsoft was unable to secure a deal to make Bing the default search engine on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) products, despite reportedly offering better terms than Google. Furthermore, Microsoft's own phone is required to use Google search due to licensing agreements with the Android mobile operating system.

The CEO of Microsoft also testified about the significant influence Apple's selection of its default search engine holds. He stated that Microsoft was open to obscuring Bing's brand on Apple devices to unseat Google from its default search engine status. Despite making progress between 2013 and 2017, when Apple opted to replace Google as the search engine for Siri and the Spotlight feature, Apple ultimately reverted to Google for the default search engine in its Safari web browser.

2022-10-03, IANS,Another Dunzo Co-founder set to exit amid severe cash crunch,https://in.investing.com/news/another-dunzo-cofounder-set-to-exit-amid-severe-cash-crunch-3833433,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Mukund Jha, Co-founder at the cash-strapped quick-grocery delivery provider Dunzo, is reportedly set to exit the company, after another co-founder Dalvir Suri decided to quit, as Dunzo faces severe cash crunch amid delayed salaries and impending layoffs.Jha exited Dunzo's board on September 1, according to The Morning Context.

A Dunzo spokesperson, however, neither confirmed nor denied the news, saying that “Mukund remains an integral part of Dunzo’s leadership team”.

“While we are restructuring the org with new leaders driving key mandates, Mukund will continue to be an important part of the strategic leadership team guiding and directing Dunzo’s future roadmap,” the spokesperson added.

The news of Jha moving on from Dunzo came a day after the company confirmed the departure of cofounder Suri.

“He has been the key zero to one person from the founding team that just gets things Dun. He has been meaning to take a break for sometime now - and with 6+ years spent building Dunzo, he plans to move forward to pursuing new journeys,” Biswas said.

Dunzo has also seen exit of some of its board members, including Vaidhehi Ravindran from Lightrock and Reliance Retail's Rajendra Kamath and Ashwin Khasgiwala, according to reports.

Dunzo is making organisation-wide changes in restructuring the business.

Dunzo, which is likely to raise $35 million in funding from existing backers like Reliance Industries (NS: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) as well as new investors, is also reportedly laying off at least “150-200” more employees.

Dunzo is likely to trim its workforce further by around 30-40 per cent.

The company has reportedly informed impacted employees that they would receive their full and final settlements in January.

Last month, Dunzo delayed the salaries of its employees for the months of June and July, this time to November, amid an ongoing fund crunch.

The startup may also vacate its office in Bengaluru to cut costs.

2022-10-03, IANS,Bing not good as Google Search and Apple could fix this: Satya Nadella,https://in.investing.com/news/bing-not-good-as-google-search-and-apple-could-fix-this-satya-nadella-3833366,"Washington, Oct 3 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the company's Bing search engine is not as good as Google (NASDAQ: ), and becoming Apple’s default search engine could actually help Bing grow in the global search market. During a testimony in the landmark US vs Google antitrust trial late on Monday, Nadella said that he sees search as the largest software category out there by far, reports The Verge.

""I used to think of Windows and Office as attractive businesses until I saw the search,"" he said during the testimony.

He said that Microsoft was prepared to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) all of the economic upside of the deal if Apple were to switch to Bing, and ""he was prepared to lose up to $15 billion a year in the process"".

Nadella said he was willing to hide the Bing brand in Apple users' search engines and respect any of the company's privacy wishes. ""Defaults are the only thing that matter, in terms of changing user behaviour,"" he was quoted as saying.

For Nadella, becoming Apple’s default search engine wouldn't be about the money, at least not directly.

""We needed to be less greedy and more competitive,"" he said during the testimony.

Asked if Microsoft tried to become Apple’s default search engine, Nadella said yes but the effort did not go well. Not only are the economics of the Google deal hugely favourable for Apple, he said, but Apple may also be afraid of what Google would do if it lost default status, according to the report.

Google also has immensely popular services like Gmail and YouTube. Nadella said AI has the potential to shake up the market a bit but he also believes it could ""further entrench Google’s dominance"".

The US Justice Department alleges that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Stock Market Today: Dow ends lower on rising Treasury yields as US averts shutdown,https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-ends-lower-on-rising-treasury-yields-as-us-averts-shutdown-3832987,"Investing.com -- The dow closed lower Monday, paced by slump in energy and utilities as Treasury yields continued to march higher after the U.S. averted a government shutdown with a last-ditch funding measure to keep the government funded for 45 days.

The slipped 0.2%, 74 points, rose 0.7%, and the was flat.

Energy starts Q4 on weak footing as oil prices slip

Energy fell 2%, paced by decline in EQT Corporation (NYSE: ), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: ) and APA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), as oil prices were dragged lower by concerns about rising supply and a higher dollar.

Still, oil prices remained above $90 a barrel, with some forecasting a boost in demand from China’s annual ‘Golden Week’ holiday.

“Oil demand looks strong with China starting its Golden Week holidays,” ANZ Research said in a recent note, referring to the eight-day annual event in China, which got underway last week Friday, and typically sparks demand for travel and spending.

Treasury yields rise as U.S. averts shutdown

Treasury yields were pushed higher by growing expectations for another Federal Reserve interest rate hike after the U.S. government averted a shutdown.

The 2-year Treasury yield rose 5.2 points to 5.098%, while the rose 12 basis points to 4.696%.

Congress passed a short-term funding measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 17, avoiding a shutdown that many had expected to dent near-term economic growth.

About 30% of traders expect the fed to lift rates next month, up from about 18% last week, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

Big tech sidesteps higher yields, but utilities slump

Big tech cut some gains, pressured by rising Treasury yields, the enemy of growth stocks, though remained supported by a rise in Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), up 3%, also helped support the broader tech sector after Goldman Sachs added the chipmaker to its “conviction buy list,” which typically includes the stock that the bank believes is likely to outperform.

Nvidia is likely to maintain its status as “the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive moat and the urgency with which customers are developing and deploying increasingly complex AI models,” Goldman Sachs in a recent note.

Utilities, commonly used as a bond proxy given the sector's steady dividends, were also hurt by rising Treasury yields, with Nextera Energy Inc (NYSE: ) and The AES Corporation (NYSE: ) leading to the downside.

Tesla in reverse as production falls in Q3

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was flat after reporting Monday that it produced 430,488 vehicles in the third quarter, down from 479,700 in the previous quarter, owing to a planned shutdown for factory upgrades.

The electric vehicle maker, however, kept its full-year production guidance of about 1.8 million unchanged. Tesla will require a “strong 4Q” to hit this number, Wedbush said, adding it sees “better days ahead [for Tesla] for 4Q and 2024.”

Tesla is set to release its Q3 results after market close on Oct. 18.

Crypto-related stocks ride Bitcoin rally higher

rose 3%, sparking a climb in cryptocurrency-related stocks including Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: ), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ).

Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains to trade just above the flatline after acquiring a payment licence in Singapore, paving the way for the crypto exchange to offer digital payment services to individuals and investors in the country."
2022-10-02, Investing.com,,https://in.investing.com/news/magnificent-seven-tech-stocks-primed-for-turnaround-goldman-sachs-suggests-93CH-3832980,"The seven largest US tech stocks, colloquially known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" are trading at notably discounted valuations and could be poised for a turnaround, according to new analysis by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ). The group, which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is currently trading at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.3, compared to 1.9 for the median stock. This marks the most significant discount since January 2017.

Despite a challenging year marked by rising interest rates and growing concerns about Federal Reserve policy, these tech giants have demonstrated resilience. Notably, shares of Nvidia have more than tripled since the beginning of the year, while Meta Platforms and Tesla shares have more than doubled. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google shares have risen roughly 50%, with Apple and Microsoft up more than a third.

This performance contrasts with last year's bear market when tech stocks led the declines. However, thanks to consistent earnings growth and the artificial intelligence revolution, tech stocks have become some of the market's biggest gainers this year, despite soaring interest rates.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their research note that the divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors. They anticipate an additional boost for these tech giants during the Q3 earnings period, as profit upgrades are expected to outnumber downgrades.

Despite this optimistic outlook, not all analysts share Goldman Sachs' bullish stance. RBC Capital expects weakness in US stocks to continue, citing data from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed a steep drop in net bullishness since mid-August.

Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs remains confident about the prospects of the US stock market. The firm now expects the S&P 500 to end 2022 at around 4,500 points, implying a potential upside of approximately 5% compared to current levels. This optimistic forecast is partly driven by expectations of falling Treasury yields, which could provide a boost to these mega-cap tech stocks.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Broadcom retains Google as key customer despite rumors of parting ways,https://in.investing.com/news/broadcom-retains-google-as-key-customer-despite-rumors-of-parting-ways-93CH-3832799,"Despite recent rumors suggesting that Alphabet's (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: GOOG) lead business unit Google was considering parting ways with semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), a Google spokesperson confirmed on Monday that its engagement with Broadcom remains unchanged, labeling Broadcom as an ""excellent partner.""

The rumor mill, despite its uncertainty, has shed light on the long-queried identity of Broadcom's significant ""computing offload customer."" While it was widely speculated to be a tech titan, likely Google, this recent internal source seemingly confirms it.

Broadcom's custom silicon projects, also known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), have been a subject of interest since 2022. The company categorized its ASIC revenue into two segments: routing and switching, and compute offload. Compute offload is a two-step process within a data center. Initially, routers and switches decide which part of the data center will handle the computing request. Processors then make the computations, which are subsequently sent back to the end user through the internet or private network by those same routers and switches.

With the confirmation that Google is Broadcom's significant ASIC customer, it's clear that Broadcom plays a crucial role in helping engineer Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)—custom processors for specific AI workloads—as well as routers and switches for Google's extensive global data center fleet.

In the spring of 2022, Broadcom revealed that its ASIC business had generated nearly $800 million in 2021 for routing and switching, and nearly $1.6 billion from compute offload. These sectors had been growing at an average annual rate of 20%. Assuming this growth rate continued and that Google is the sole ASIC customer (which is likely not the case), Google could represent upwards of $3 billion in revenue for Broadcom in 2022, or nearly 10% of total annual sales.

Even though Google has debunked the rumors of parting ways with Broadcom, other ASIC companies such as Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology Group, a smaller competitor to Broadcom also riding the AI wave with its own routing and switching chip, would likely be interested in this business opportunity.

Earlier this year, similar rumors suggested that Apple (NASDAQ: ) was nearing the end of its relationship with Broadcom for 5G wireless and Wi-Fi chips. However, a few months later, Apple renewed its multibillion-dollar supply agreement with Broadcom for another couple of years. The secret to Broadcom's retention of these tech giants lies in its chip designs, extensive patent library, and some proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities.

Despite the rumors of Google trying to save a couple of billion dollars a year, it is well-positioned to continue paying Broadcom for its assistance in compute offload chips while simultaneously growing its profitability from digital ads and Google Cloud.

Broadcom's integral role in the technology sector continues to be highlighted through its partnerships with tech giants like Apple and Google.

The announcement was made at the firm's annual conference on Tuesday, aiming to enhance its platform amid post-lockdown office returns and stiff competition from tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ).

Zoom's market capitalization stands at $20.48 billion, with a P/E ratio of 142.21, according to InvestingPro data. Despite a declining trend in earnings per share, as indicated by InvestingPro Tips, the company's free cash flow exceeds net income, showing high earnings quality. It's also noteworthy that Zoom holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet, providing a solid financial footing for the company.

While Zoom's shares have remained stagnant compared to the S&P 500's 10% rise, the company's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Kelly Steckelberg, sees this new product as a step towards expanding Zoom's platform. This move comes as Zoom's stock price has often moved in the opposite direction of the market, as per InvestingPro Tips.

The move places Zoom in direct competition within the collaborative applications market, which is currently led by Microsoft with a 30% share, followed by Google with a 13.5%, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Zoom holds an 11% share in this market. The company's revenue for the last twelve months was $4463.74 million with a revenue growth of 3.92%, as per InvestingPro data.

The launch of 'Zoom Docs' comes at a time when Microsoft Teams has been drawing business away from Zoom's customer base. Despite this, Zoom reported a 7% increase in its enterprise customer base from the previous year, now standing at 218,100 enterprises. This is in line with the InvestingPro Tips prediction that Zoom's net income is expected to grow this year, and the company will be profitable.

On September 18, the European Commission will conduct a high-level digital dialogue with China to facilitate EU-China communication on digital strategy and tech developments – though it’s unlikely China will be falling into lockstep with the bloc anytime soon. Thankfully, a recent EU report highlighted progress on innovative tech, such as Web3 tools, that could also bring substantial improvements in how data is managed by users.

EC Talks Up Swash Data Union in New Paper

The EU’s attitude to data privacy was outlined in a recent policy report published by the European Commission’s science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre (JRC).

Entitled ‘Mapping the landscape of data intermediaries: Emerging models for more inclusive data governance,’ the 75-page paper aims to promote ‘inclusive data governance’ by highlighting tools that let users wield greater control over the footprint they leave behind when browsing the internet.

One of the tools highlighted in the report was Swash, a data-focused web3 ecosystem comprising tools and solutions for both users and businesses. In a section on Data Unions, which protect and bargain on rights over personal data generated via platforms, Swash’s browser extension was cited as an example of a product that ‘allows data subjects to get power over their data while they receive a share of the profits they generate.’

It is not the first time Swash has been endorsed by those concerned with upholding data protection rights. Earlier this year, the platform passed a rigorous independent audit carried out by the Data & Marketing Association (DMA), becoming the only data union to be named an accredited member. Swash also completed a Data Protection Impact Assessment with the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office.

The EC’s mention of Swash doesn’t just highlight a commitment to exploring options consumers have to protect their data. It also underscores the Commission’s interest in emerging web3 technologies. Gradually, the web3 landscape is coming to be recognized as legitimate and disruptive in the eyes of governing bodies, hence the EU’s instituting of a formal regulatory framework for Crypto-Assets Issuers and Crypto-Asset Services Providers (the MiCA regulations).

Winds of Web3 Change Continue to Blow

It’s not just MiCA: the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI), whose nodes are run by EU member states, recently presented at the European Blockchain Convention in Barcelona, where conversations centered on the advancement of decentralized governance (DeGov) services.

A subsequent article on the EC website suggested that Europe could:

“lead the way in the transition from Web 2.0’s BigTech platform model to a vibrant European Web3 ecosystem.”

Swash is an example of a web3 service, where all data transactions are denominated in $SWASH crypto tokens. What’s more, users can contribute the value of their data to social development causes and use it for value exchange through the Data for Good initiative.

While users get nothing from the sale of their data in the old web2 model dominated by Google (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and the rest, Swash ensures that 70% of profits made from data sales lands in their pockets. Advertisers can also use Swash to tackle ad fraud and wasted ad spend, and to serve up ads to fully opted-in, web3-minded users. The theory goes that if users have already given their browser permission to display ads (based on certain preferences) in return for rewards, they are more likely to engage with what is shown to them.

A new era of data protection is upon us, strictly enforced by regulators and propelled by a wave of innovative web3 data intermediaries promoting a fairer, more user-centric approach. Piece by piece, the data economy of the future is being assembled, and the centralized data control that characterized the previous model is being replaced by blockchain-native platforms, programmable privacy, decentralized data storage, and user-owned digital identities.

Although data privacy challenges remain, the evolution of web3 is changing the way data is collected, stored and shared – and putting consumers firmly in the driver’s seat."

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Alphabet's search division faces antitrust allegations over default search engine monopoly,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabets-search-division-faces-antitrust-allegations-over-default-search-engine-monopoly-93CH-3833510,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s search division, Google, is currently under scrutiny in a US antitrust trial. The company is accused of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to rivals, smartphone manufacturers, and wireless carriers to ensure its search engine remains the default option on mobile devices and web browsers. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is leading the charge against Google, with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). CEO Satya Nadella testifying on Monday.

Nadella dismissed Google's assertion that it is easy for users to change default search engine settings on mobile devices. He described the notion of choice in the search market as ""bogus,"" stating that Microsoft's efforts to make Bing the default search engine on iPhones encountered numerous roadblocks.

Last week, Jonathan Tinter, Microsoft's business development executive, testified that despite offering more favorable terms than Google and being willing to incur significant losses, Microsoft failed to secure a deal to make Bing the default search app on Apple (NASDAQ: )'s products. Instead, Apple renewed its agreement with Google. Tinter also revealed that Microsoft's Surface Duo smartphone was obligated to use Google search as part of its Android mobile operating system license agreement, limiting its ability to use Bing.

Nadella, who played a key role in developing Bing, testified about Microsoft's struggle to break into the online advertising market dominated by Google. Despite Bing gaining some ground on desktop computers through integration with Microsoft's Internet Explorer and later Edge browser, it has struggled on mobile devices where users predominantly use Google. Nadella stated: ""It's a hard game to make any breakthroughs, but no one can accuse us of not being persistent.""

The US government argues that Google has engaged in illegal payments of $10 billion annually to entities like Apple and wireless service providers such as AT&T (NYSE: ) to secure its position as the default search engine on their devices. Google, which controls approximately 90% of the search market and is valued at over $1 trillion, has denied these allegations. The company maintains that its dominance in the lucrative advertising sector is a result of product quality, not illegal practices.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Microsoft's struggle to compete with Google in search market dominance,https://in.investing.com/news/microsofts-struggle-to-compete-with-google-in-search-market-dominance-93CH-3833453,"The ongoing antitrust trial against Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has brought to light the struggle of Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ: ) Bing search engine to compete with Google's dominance in the market. The CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, testified on Monday, shedding light on the company's efforts and challenges.

Despite investing $100 billion into Bing, Nadella acknowledged its position as a ""very, very low share player"" in the search market. He explained that Microsoft continues to persist with Bing because they view it as a software category they can contribute to, even though it has been challenging to make significant breakthroughs.

Adding to the complexity of the competition is the role of artificial intelligence (AI). Google began incorporating its AI software, Bard, into its search engine in March. Nadella stated that Google could extend its lead by using the substantial profits from its search business to secure exclusive rights to content that could enhance its search AI, thereby outperforming rivals.

The U.S. Department of Justice accuses Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) search division of unlawfully maintaining a monopoly by paying $10 billion annually to ensure that its search engine remains the default option. Google denies these allegations. The government is using Microsoft's struggle with Bing as evidence that even with substantial resources, it is difficult to challenge Google's dominance.

Nadella also revealed that Microsoft was unable to secure a deal to make Bing the default search engine on Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) products, despite reportedly offering better terms than Google. Furthermore, Microsoft's own phone is required to use Google search due to licensing agreements with the Android mobile operating system.

The CEO of Microsoft also testified about the significant influence Apple's selection of its default search engine holds. He stated that Microsoft was open to obscuring Bing's brand on Apple devices to unseat Google from its default search engine status. Despite making progress between 2013 and 2017, when Apple opted to replace Google as the search engine for Siri and the Spotlight feature, Apple ultimately reverted to Google for the default search engine in its Safari web browser.

A Dunzo spokesperson, however, neither confirmed nor denied the news, saying that “Mukund remains an integral part of Dunzo’s leadership team”.

“While we are restructuring the org with new leaders driving key mandates, Mukund will continue to be an important part of the strategic leadership team guiding and directing Dunzo’s future roadmap,” the spokesperson added.

The news of Jha moving on from Dunzo came a day after the company confirmed the departure of cofounder Suri.

“He has been the key zero to one person from the founding team that just gets things Dun. He has been meaning to take a break for sometime now - and with 6+ years spent building Dunzo, he plans to move forward to pursuing new journeys,” Biswas said.

Dunzo has also seen exit of some of its board members, including Vaidhehi Ravindran from Lightrock and Reliance Retail's Rajendra Kamath and Ashwin Khasgiwala, according to reports.

Dunzo is making organisation-wide changes in restructuring the business.

Dunzo, which is likely to raise $35 million in funding from existing backers like Reliance Industries (NS: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) as well as new investors, is also reportedly laying off at least “150-200” more employees.

Dunzo is likely to trim its workforce further by around 30-40 per cent.

The company has reportedly informed impacted employees that they would receive their full and final settlements in January.

Last month, Dunzo delayed the salaries of its employees for the months of June and July, this time to November, amid an ongoing fund crunch.

The startup may also vacate its office in Bengaluru to cut costs.

2022-10-03, IANS,Bing not good as Google Search and Apple could fix this: Satya Nadella,https://in.investing.com/news/bing-not-good-as-google-search-and-apple-could-fix-this-satya-nadella-3833366,"Washington, Oct 3 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella has admitted that the company's Bing search engine is not as good as Google (NASDAQ: ), and becoming Apple’s default search engine could actually help Bing grow in the global search market. During a testimony in the landmark US vs Google antitrust trial late on Monday, Nadella said that he sees search as the largest software category out there by far, reports The Verge.

""I used to think of Windows and Office as attractive businesses until I saw the search,"" he said during the testimony.

He said that Microsoft was prepared to give Apple (NASDAQ: ) all of the economic upside of the deal if Apple were to switch to Bing, and ""he was prepared to lose up to $15 billion a year in the process"".

Nadella said he was willing to hide the Bing brand in Apple users' search engines and respect any of the company's privacy wishes. ""Defaults are the only thing that matter, in terms of changing user behaviour,"" he was quoted as saying.

For Nadella, becoming Apple’s default search engine wouldn't be about the money, at least not directly.

""We needed to be less greedy and more competitive,"" he said during the testimony.

Asked if Microsoft tried to become Apple’s default search engine, Nadella said yes but the effort did not go well. Not only are the economics of the Google deal hugely favourable for Apple, he said, but Apple may also be afraid of what Google would do if it lost default status, according to the report.

Google also has immensely popular services like Gmail and YouTube. Nadella said AI has the potential to shake up the market a bit but he also believes it could ""further entrench Google’s dominance"".

The US Justice Department alleges that Google, which has around 90 per cent of the search market, has abused the dominance of its search engine to throttle competition and innovation.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Stock Market Today: Dow ends lower on rising Treasury yields as US averts shutdown,https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-ends-lower-on-rising-treasury-yields-as-us-averts-shutdown-3832987,"Investing.com -- The dow closed lower Monday, paced by slump in energy and utilities as Treasury yields continued to march higher after the U.S. averted a government shutdown with a last-ditch funding measure to keep the government funded for 45 days.

The slipped 0.2%, 74 points, rose 0.7%, and the was flat.

Energy starts Q4 on weak footing as oil prices slip

Energy fell 2%, paced by decline in EQT Corporation (NYSE: ), Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: ) and APA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), as oil prices were dragged lower by concerns about rising supply and a higher dollar.

Still, oil prices remained above $90 a barrel, with some forecasting a boost in demand from China’s annual ‘Golden Week’ holiday.

“Oil demand looks strong with China starting its Golden Week holidays,” ANZ Research said in a recent note, referring to the eight-day annual event in China, which got underway last week Friday, and typically sparks demand for travel and spending.

Treasury yields rise as U.S. averts shutdown

Treasury yields were pushed higher by growing expectations for another Federal Reserve interest rate hike after the U.S. government averted a shutdown.

The 2-year Treasury yield rose 5.2 points to 5.098%, while the rose 12 basis points to 4.696%.

Congress passed a short-term funding measure to keep the government funded through Nov. 17, avoiding a shutdown that many had expected to dent near-term economic growth.

About 30% of traders expect the fed to lift rates next month, up from about 18% last week, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

Big tech sidesteps higher yields, but utilities slump

Big tech cut some gains, pressured by rising Treasury yields, the enemy of growth stocks, though remained supported by a rise in Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), up 3%, also helped support the broader tech sector after Goldman Sachs added the chipmaker to its “conviction buy list,” which typically includes the stock that the bank believes is likely to outperform.

Nvidia is likely to maintain its status as “the accelerated computing industry standard for the foreseeable future given its competitive moat and the urgency with which customers are developing and deploying increasingly complex AI models,” Goldman Sachs in a recent note.

Utilities, commonly used as a bond proxy given the sector's steady dividends, were also hurt by rising Treasury yields, with Nextera Energy Inc (NYSE: ) and The AES Corporation (NYSE: ) leading to the downside.

Tesla in reverse as production falls in Q3

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was flat after reporting Monday that it produced 430,488 vehicles in the third quarter, down from 479,700 in the previous quarter, owing to a planned shutdown for factory upgrades.

The electric vehicle maker, however, kept its full-year production guidance of about 1.8 million unchanged. Tesla will require a “strong 4Q” to hit this number, Wedbush said, adding it sees “better days ahead [for Tesla] for 4Q and 2024.”

Tesla is set to release its Q3 results after market close on Oct. 18.

Crypto-related stocks ride Bitcoin rally higher

rose 3%, sparking a climb in cryptocurrency-related stocks including Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: ), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ).

Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ) gave up some gains to trade just above the flatline after acquiring a payment licence in Singapore, paving the way for the crypto exchange to offer digital payment services to individuals and investors in the country."

The group, which includes Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), is currently trading at a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.3, compared to 1.9 for the median stock. This marks the most significant discount since January 2017.

Despite a challenging year marked by rising interest rates and growing concerns about Federal Reserve policy, these tech giants have demonstrated resilience. Notably, shares of Nvidia have more than tripled since the beginning of the year, while Meta Platforms and Tesla shares have more than doubled. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google shares have risen roughly 50%, with Apple and Microsoft up more than a third.

This performance contrasts with last year's bear market when tech stocks led the declines. However, thanks to consistent earnings growth and the artificial intelligence revolution, tech stocks have become some of the market's biggest gainers this year, despite soaring interest rates.

Goldman Sachs analysts noted in their research note that the divergence between falling valuations and improving fundamentals represents an opportunity for investors. They anticipate an additional boost for these tech giants during the Q3 earnings period, as profit upgrades are expected to outnumber downgrades.

Despite this optimistic outlook, not all analysts share Goldman Sachs' bullish stance. RBC Capital expects weakness in US stocks to continue, citing data from the AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, which showed a steep drop in net bullishness since mid-August.

Nonetheless, Goldman Sachs remains confident about the prospects of the US stock market. The firm now expects the S&P 500 to end 2022 at around 4,500 points, implying a potential upside of approximately 5% compared to current levels. This optimistic forecast is partly driven by expectations of falling Treasury yields, which could provide a boost to these mega-cap tech stocks.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Broadcom retains Google as key customer despite rumors of parting ways,https://in.investing.com/news/broadcom-retains-google-as-key-customer-despite-rumors-of-parting-ways-93CH-3832799,"Despite recent rumors suggesting that Alphabet's (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: GOOG) lead business unit Google was considering parting ways with semiconductor giant Broadcom (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), a Google spokesperson confirmed on Monday that its engagement with Broadcom remains unchanged, labeling Broadcom as an ""excellent partner.""

The rumor mill, despite its uncertainty, has shed light on the long-queried identity of Broadcom's significant ""computing offload customer."" While it was widely speculated to be a tech titan, likely Google, this recent internal source seemingly confirms it.

Broadcom's custom silicon projects, also known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), have been a subject of interest since 2022. The company categorized its ASIC revenue into two segments: routing and switching, and compute offload. Compute offload is a two-step process within a data center. Initially, routers and switches decide which part of the data center will handle the computing request. Processors then make the computations, which are subsequently sent back to the end user through the internet or private network by those same routers and switches.

With the confirmation that Google is Broadcom's significant ASIC customer, it's clear that Broadcom plays a crucial role in helping engineer Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)—custom processors for specific AI workloads—as well as routers and switches for Google's extensive global data center fleet.

In the spring of 2022, Broadcom revealed that its ASIC business had generated nearly $800 million in 2021 for routing and switching, and nearly $1.6 billion from compute offload. These sectors had been growing at an average annual rate of 20%. Assuming this growth rate continued and that Google is the sole ASIC customer (which is likely not the case), Google could represent upwards of $3 billion in revenue for Broadcom in 2022, or nearly 10% of total annual sales.

Even though Google has debunked the rumors of parting ways with Broadcom, other ASIC companies such as Marvell (NASDAQ: ) Technology Group, a smaller competitor to Broadcom also riding the AI wave with its own routing and switching chip, would likely be interested in this business opportunity.

Earlier this year, similar rumors suggested that Apple (NASDAQ: ) was nearing the end of its relationship with Broadcom for 5G wireless and Wi-Fi chips. However, a few months later, Apple renewed its multibillion-dollar supply agreement with Broadcom for another couple of years. The secret to Broadcom's retention of these tech giants lies in its chip designs, extensive patent library, and some proprietary in-house manufacturing capabilities.

Despite the rumors of Google trying to save a couple of billion dollars a year, it is well-positioned to continue paying Broadcom for its assistance in compute offload chips while simultaneously growing its profitability from digital ads and Google Cloud.

Broadcom's integral role in the technology sector continues to be highlighted through its partnerships with tech giants like Apple and Google.

Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

2022-10-01, IANS,"Freelancers, startups drive demand for co-working spaces in Bengaluru",https://in.investing.com/news/freelancers-startups-drive-demand-for-coworking-spaces-in-bengaluru-3831339,"Bengaluru, Oct 1 (IANS) IT city Bengaluru, which is hailed as a cradle of startups, is witnessing a trend of startups opting for more flexible offices known as co-working spaces.The demand for co-working spaces 2022 is increasing in the city. Bengaluru houses the world’s largest co-working campus in HSR Layout.

Flexible offices or co-working spaces are coming in handy for startups as they save a huge investment of renting, leasing or purchasing the office space. They provide office space as per the requirement, budget and time.

As the trend is catching up, entrepreneurs are also explaining that co-working spaces are also helping in crucial networking.

Co-working presents flexibility in terms of leasing contracts and a variety of options. Geographic flexibility is also a significant asset as co-working spaces are available in premium and easily accessible locations.

Startups can be free of such administrative and operative functions and focus on business.

Hence, co-working can complement the flexibility they desire.Not just processes, but co-working can also substantially reduce the initial costs associated with traditional office leases, rent, utilities, maintenance, and office furnishings.

Ashish Agarwal, Co-founder and CEO of Enzyme Office Space talking to IANS stated, ""The rising demand for flexible offices in India, driven by changing work habits and the growth of startups and freelancers, has made Bengaluru the top city with 39 per cent of operational flex space since 2018, followed by Delhi NCR at 17 per cent.”

Membership plans enable startups to pay only for needed space, reducing leasing and maintenance costs. Co-working spaces bring professionals from various fields together, fostering networking, collaboration, and potential partnerships, he stated.

Ashish Agarwal further explained that startups often begin in co-working spaces for flexibility and transition to private offices as they expand. These offerings make co-working spaces popular for freelancers, startups, remote workers, and established businesses seeking flexible workspaces.

Shesh Paplikar, Founder and CEO of BHIVE Workspace, which established a huge co-working space on the upscale Church Street in Bengaluru recently, explained to IANS, in terms of demand 2022 saw a significant surge in signups because of pent-up demand and 2020 and 2021 were slow. Once the pandemic was contained many organisations wanted to return to office. 2022 is also witnessing a lot of new supply in the co-working industry.

However, the demand has been slightly on the slower side in 2022 when compared to 2022, which was phenomenally good, so overall it seems slightly muted. Having said that, there are still a lot of good, stable companies that are expanding, he opined.

Startups are a bit more cautious at the moment as there is a funding winter. If their burn rate is very high, they are being forced to reduce the burn rate before they can raise more money, which is also leading to a standstill in hiring or layoffs. On the brighter side of things, a lot of global companies are still hiring in India though they are laying off resources abroad. So, the industry is still optimistic about the demand in 2022, Shesh Paplikar explained.

In general, using co-working space increases the agility of any company, not just a startup. However, given that startups usually want to be more agile, scale up or down, pivot around, change strategies, etc., he states.

BHIVE also has the world's largest co-working campus, the BHIVE HSR Campus in Bengaluru. Inspired by Google (NASDAQ: ), BHIVE created a world-class office space that offers additional amenities such as cricket, football, basketball, gym, etc., beyond just office spaces.BHIVE also organises a lot of startup-related events, seminars, networking, investor meets and mentorship programs that add value to the startup ecosystem, Shesh Paplikar states.

Sumit Agarwal, Co-Founder and CEO, of Simply Vyapar Apps Pvt Ltd stated, ""Co-working spaces are always the first preference for any startup as it gives flexibility with customization whenever needed and secondly scalability. Having its own space means huge cash flow which otherwise can be utilised for business expansion.

“We started with 150 seats from Enzyme initially. The way they have curated the space keeping in mind our smallest of the requirements, makes the team unique in terms of delivering as committed. Ashish has been very supportive and accommodating in our journey of scaling from 150 to 1,500 seats to date and more to come in future.""

Natasha Gupta, Founder and CEO, Story Brews Communication, said, ""Cost effective conveniences and flexibility are the key reasons why startups prefer co-working spaces over traditional office rentals. Since, as a startup, we have a hybrid work model in place and we operate in a fast-paced environment, a co-working set-up is not only a great enabler but also provides the right platform to connect, collaborate and be productive.""

""These workspaces offer a one-stop solution with tech-enabled meeting rooms, clean work areas, fresh coffee, housekeeping, etc., the primary things which startups need to function and operate daily. Over and above the co-working spaces are melting pots of like-minded people that create a perfect atmosphere for startups to network,"" Natasha Gupta says.

""Besides, startups like us, who operate with a lean team, find the tailor-made and customization features of co-working beneficial since we get the freedom of choosing the exact number of seats we want, with the provision to expand at any given point in time.”

2022-09-30, IANS,How mega search engines Google was up against just faded away,https://in.investing.com/news/how-mega-search-engines-google-was-up-against-just-faded-away-3830894,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has become synonymous with search engines. When it was first starting out in 1998, however, it was competing with names such as Yahoo, Ask Jeeves and AltaVista for a share of the pie, Straits Times reported.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was once a global leader in e-mail, online news and search until the start of the 21st century.

However, the company was swiftly overtaken by rivals like Gmail and Hotmail in its main search and display ad businesses, while its news aggregation fell behind Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Twitter and other digital channels, the BBC reported.

With most of its revenue coming from selling advertising space, the company’s sales declined as its audience drifted to other platforms, Straits Times reported.

Back when the Internet was mainly used by academia and governments, Mosaic Communications Corporation launched Netscape Navigator, becoming one of the first graphical Web browsers in 1994.

However, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) soon launched the rival Internet Explorer, sparking a tussle to take control of the browser market, Straits Times reported.

Mosaic, which rebranded as Netscape Communications, partnered American Web portal Excite to power its search engine. Netscape was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1998.

Although AOL officially shuttered Netscape Navigator in 2008, the open-source Mozilla Project founded on Netscape browser’s code continued, eventually birthing the popular Firefox browser, the report said.

Users of the now defunct Internet Explorer will remember MSN Search, which was Microsoft’s default search engine in the 1990s and 2000s.

The service, introduced in 1998, outsourced its search engine to several companies until Microsoft built its own Web crawler.

This was rebranded as Windows Live Search and eventually Bing in 2009.

That year, Microsoft and Yahoo announced a decade-long deal that replaced the Yahoo search engine with Bing, Straits Times reported.

In 2022, Bing was revamped to include a new chatbot feature based on OpenAI’s Chat GPT-4, which helped it hit 100 million active users in March.

AltaVista was one of the earliest search engines to index vast quantities of websites after it was launched in 1995.

The search engine was popular because it had indexed about 20 million webpages, outstripping its rivals at the time, and had fast computers that could swiftly churn results, the BBC reported.

The software was created by computer scientists in the research labs of Digital Equipment Corporation.

In 2001, the number of searches on Google overtook AltaVista, which until then had been one of the top Web destinations.

More than a decade later, Yahoo pulled the plug on the search engine in 2013 along with several products, Straits Times reported.

WebCrawler was reportedly the first search engine to allow users to search for text in any webpage, a method that would become common for major search engines.

It was developed by a University of Washington student Brian Pinkerton during his free time and launched in 1994.

The next year, AOL bought WebCrawler and added its arachnid mascot named Spidey, Straits Times said.

In 1996, the search engine was the second most visited website on the Internet, The Washington Post reported.

But WebCrawler was sold less than two years later in 1997 to Excite, which eventually went bankrupt.

WebCrawler has changed hands several times and continues to exist today, making it one of the oldest surviving search engines, Straits Times reported.

In 1996, the search engine was the second most visited website on the Internet, The Washington Post reported.

The website known as Ask Jeeves was co-founded in 1996 by technologist David Warthern and venture capitalist Garett Gruener, who dreamt of a service that could speak with people using natural language processing, Straits Times reported.

Lacking the necessary technology, the website, named after the fictional butler, morphed into a question-answering service coded to recognise certain words and provide broad answers to these questions, according to The Atlantic.

Its domain was created on November 29, 1995.

By 1999, the website was answering 1 million queries daily, online magazine Mental Floss reported.

As Ask Jeeves expanded in both size and popularity, trouble cropped up. For example, as its question database expanded into the millions, some answers became less relevant, according to online publication Search Engine Watch, Straits Times reported.

By the 2000s, the dot-com bubble had burst, sending advertisers fleeing from Web development and causing millions in losses for the company.

The website was reconfigured to be more search-oriented with a third-party engine, and the company reported a profit in 2003 due to an ad revenue tie-up with Google, according to Mental Floss.

In 2005, it was bought by New York-based InterActive Corp, with Ask Jeeves replaced with the more generic Ask.com the following year, Straits Times reported.

Page was tasked with showing him around – and they disagreed about nearly everything, according to some.But the next year, they formed a partnership that led to the creation of a search engine in their dorms, CBS News reported.

What was formerly called Backrub, a search engine that scoured the internet and ranked pages based on importance, was later named Google.

By August 1998, they had $100,000 from co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and left the dorms for a garage in Menlo Park, California. Google Inc (NASDAQ: ). got its official start, CBS News reported.

Susan Wojcicki, who later went on to lead YouTube, which Google eventually acquired, owned the garage and became Google's 16th employee.

Google's initial public offering – when it became a publicly traded company – happened in 2004, and several more big business moves have been made since. The company created Gmail, the Android phone and acquired YouTube, to name a few.

One thing that has been consistent with the ever-changing company: Google Doodles. The homepage logo has been turned into ""doodles"" since 1998, when Google marked the Burning Man Festival in Nevada with a doodle that looked like the wooden man burned at the festival.

In 2015, the Google logo got a new font. That same year,Page announced Alphabetwould become Google's holding company. Google remained the search engine,and Alphabet is the parentof all the company's ventures, such as Waymo, the self-driving car company.

Page became CEO of Alphabet and Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Google. In 2019, Pichai also became CEO of Alphabet when Page stepped down and so did Brin as president, CBS News reported.

2022-09-30, IANS,"After being in CCI's crosshairs, Google in Data Protection Bill's shadow",https://in.investing.com/news/after-being-in-ccis-crosshairs-google-in-data-protection-bills-shadow-3830891,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Facing anti-competition lawsuits and complaints globally, Google (NASDAQ: ) in recent years has seen a fiercely-fought battle with the Indian regulators, especially with the Competition Commission of India.Will the new Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (DPDP), the nation's first-ever legislation aimed at safeguarding users’ personal data from Big Tech, make its life tougher?

In the first case of a Big Tech giant paying a heavy penalty to the Indian regulators, Google in August paid the entire penalty amount of Rs 1,337.76 crore imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in the Android case. The penalty amount was deposited in the Consolidated Fund of India, within the 30-day deadline given by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in its order.

The Indian market regulator had imposed the penalty on Google in October 2022 for allegedly exploiting its dominant position in the Android market.

The CCI has also imposed a penalty of Rs 936.44 crore on Google in a separate case for abusing its dominant position with respect to its Play Store policies.

Earlier this week, the NCLAT sought responses from Google and the CCI in a plea by Google challenging the penalty of Rs 936.44 crore.

The CCI had penalised Google for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the app store market ecosystem. The NCLAT has now deferred the hearing to November 28.

Earlier this year, in January, the NCLAT had already denied interim relief to Google in this case and rejected its challenge against the penalty. Subsequently, Google took the matter to the Supreme Court but withdrew the appeal in April, opting to continue the case in the NCLAT.

The CCI also directed Google not to engage in anti-competitive activities and mandated the inclusion of third-party billing and payment processing services for in-app purchases.

Dr Ritesh Malik, Director, Alliance for Digital India Foundation (ADIF), said that Big Tech firms started taking the fines/penalties as 'cost of doing business' and preferred to pay the same rather than making the ecosystem more fair and non-discriminative.

""It is important to note that Google has made the payment after spending all possible avenues, including reaching out to the Supreme Court and the NCLAT. The paramount concern is whether Google is complying with the CCI rulings in letter and spirit,"" Malik said.

With the DPDP Bill, 2022, becoming a reality, experts say that forthcoming rules under the new law will empower Indian users about how Big Tech companies like Google, Meta (NASDAQ: ) or X can or cannot use their data.

""The Act aims to concretise the efforts that Big Tech, and data fiduciaries in general, must now undertake towards respecting the users' privacy rights and control over their personal data. This will now entail transparently informing the users about the specific purposes of data processing, while also obtaining clear and precise user consent that may be later withdrawn,"" according to Harsh Walia, Partner at Khaitan & Co.

The users may also request erasure of their data. Moreover, the principle of data minimisation will require collection of only that personal data which is necessary for the specified purpose.

According to experts, the success of the data protection law will be determined by when and how new rules are made and how effectively they are implemented.

""It is also necessary to understand what will be the status of the old IT rules till the new rules are made. Also, we need to see how effective will be the practical mechanism for redressal of common people's grievances as per India's new law on foreign tech companies,"" Virag Gupta, Supreme Court lawyer and cyber law expert, told IANS.

With the ban on illegal data business, according to the new law, if tax is collected from the data business, then both, society and the economy will be strengthened, Gupta stressed.

The Bill has provisions for hefty penalties ranging from a minimum fine of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on big internet companies' platforms for violating rules to enable digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data.

The DPDP Bill is certainly a legislation that will create a deep lasting behavioural change and create high penalty punitive consequences for any or all platforms that misuse or exploit the personal data of any Indian citizen, according to Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

""For many years, it has been known that many platforms, companies or data fiduciaries have been collecting personal data of individual citizens, not just in India but all around the world and have been exploiting that personal data for their own business models, algorithms, and many other ways,"" he said in a video message recently.

This has been done without the awareness or the agreement of the person whose personal data it was.

""This is certainly legislation that will create a deep lasting behavioural change and create punitive consequences, high-penalty punitive consequences for any or all platforms that misuse or exploit the personal data of any Indian citizen,"" the minister had stressed.

2022-09-30, IANS,Can Google rule super-competitive smartphone market with Pixel?,https://in.investing.com/news/can-google-rule-supercompetitive-smartphone-market-with-pixel-3830890,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which has been a market leader in online search and other product categories for decades, is yet to cement its place in the global smartphone industry despite the popularity of the Google Pixel brand.According to Statista Consumer Insights released in May, Google remains a niche player in the smartphone market, with less than five per cent of smartphone users calling a Google device their main phone in most major markets.

However, a recent report by Counterpoint Research showed that the Google smartphone market grew in Japan, making the brand number two in the country.

Google achieved 9 per cent of the market share in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, surpassing local brands to secure the second position after Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has historically dominated the market with over 50 per cent share.

The recently launched Pixel 7a showed a 74 per cent increase in sales when compared to its predecessor.

According to industry experts, when it comes to India, the smartphone market offers significant headroom for growth in the country.

To succeed in this hypercompetitive market and win over demanding consumers requires an intricate dance between cutting-edge innovation and a deep understanding of the heartbeat of the market.

""Google’s upcoming Pixel phones are poised to build on the exceptional camera capabilities and seamless software experience of previous generation Pixel phones. If competitively priced and supported by aggressive go-to-market initiatives, the new Pixel phones have the potential to make significant strides in India,"" Prabhu Ram, Head of Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

""With good after-sales support, they can carve a niche amid the demands of India's discerning consumers. The strong premiumisation wave provides good tailwinds,"" he added.

Google debuted the ‘Made by Google’ Pixel smartphones in 2016 globally, including India. In the coming years, it launched Pixel 2 series, and Pixel 3 series in the country.

In 2019, Google decided not to release the Pixel 4 and instead released the Pixel 3A in May of that year.

In 2021, Google launched the Pixel 6 series and last year launched the Pixel 7 series.

Now, Google is set to launch Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices globally on October 4. The Pixel 8 is expected to feature a 6.2-inch display, Tensor G3 processor, and 50MP+12MP rear camera set-up, while the Pixel 8 Pro may come with a large 6.7-inch display, Tensor G3 processor and feature a triple camera set-up with a 64MP and a 48MP ultra-wide-angle camera.

In Q4 2022, Google overtook Samsung (KS: ) to become the number two brand in the global smartwatch market, showing significant growth while competing with market leaders. Apple continued to lead and dominate the market globally, according to Canalys report.

YouTube has now become the platform of choice for four out of every five people online in India while its short-video-making app called Shorts has grown in popularity, with 96 per cent aged 18 to 44 in the country using YouTube Shorts.

With an average of 70 billion daily views globally, YouTube Shorts continues to grow in popularity among viewers in India, according to the company.

In February, Google (NASDAQ: ) officially started ad revenue sharing on YouTube Shorts with creators to compete with Instagram Reels. Earlier, creators were only allowed to monetise long-form content on the platform.

Shorts watch-time now also surpassed devices with 88 per cent of online 18-44-year-olds watching short-form video content on a TV over the past 12 months in the country.

“In the 15 years since we launched YouTube in India, there has been an extraordinary all-round digital transformation, in connectivity and in content, and today, people have created a boundaryless viewer experience for themselves that straddles across their smartphones and their connected TVs,” said Satya Raghavan, Director, Marketing Partners, Google India.

Together with the total hours of content uploaded to YouTube by channels in India growing by over 40 per cent in 2022 compared to June 2022, 35+ adults averaged over 70 minutes of YouTube per day in that month.

As creators begin to tap gen AI for new ideas and audiences, the year has seen over 1.7 billion views of videos related to or using generative AI tools globally.

About 70 per cent of 18-44 year-old viewers online agree that they are open to watching content from creators that use AI to generate their content.

Google recently launched ""YouTube Courses"" -- a new way for creators in India to monetise their content while educating people.

YouTube Courses is an online medium to share learning materials in the form of videos. It will also incorporate PDF and other files for reference.

According to Google, the creator's economy of YouTube contributed Rs 10,000 crores to the Indian GDP in 2021 and simultaneously created 7.5 million new forms of employment.

Last year, YouTube announced a new programme that will allow creators to monetise their long-form videos with licensed music in 2022.

The company has introduced 'Creator Music', giving YouTube creators easy access to an ever-growing catalogue of music for use in their long-form videos.

YouTube Shorts has more than 2 billion logged-in monthly users, Google mentioned in its results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2022. This figure is up from 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users for YouTube Shorts announced last year.

Google also reported that YouTube brought in $7.67 billion in advertising revenue. This is 4 per cent higher than the same period last year.

YouTube was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.

As smartphones have brought millions more online, Indians have become some of the most enthusiastic Google users. Using products like Gmail, Translate and Android, India is second only to the US in total number of mobile 'Search' queries.

Search in 2003 started in English but the company quickly added Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil and many other languages going forward.

India's digital transformation is at a tipping point and millions of connected Indians, affordable smartphones and data, record highs in digital payments, the digitisation of citizen services, and a vibrant startup ecosystem have put the technology sector on track to become the single largest contributor to the national economy.

With this in mind, Google introduced India-first innovations, worked to lower barriers to access, and invested in strengthening the strategic pillars of India’s digital economy through its $10 billion (approximately Rs 75,000 crore) India Digitisation Fund that was announced in 2020.

The company is investing the money in the country via a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem investments.

According to Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the pace of technological change in India has been extraordinary, and there’s so much opportunity still ahead.

“We’re helping to advance India’s digital future. That includes our efforts to build a single, unified AI model that will be capable of handling over 100 Indian languages across speech and text – part of our global effort to bring the world’s 1,000 most-spoken languages online, and to help people access knowledge and information in their preferred language,” Pichai said in December last year.

Google Pay has completed more than five years in India. At Google Pay, the company used advanced methods in our safety engine that analyze aggregate transaction patterns of millions of users, relating this to a graph of a billion nodes.

The company also introduced a useful new feature in Google Pay that makes it easier than ever to access transaction history.

In June, Google partnered with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enable Aadhaar-based authentication for UPI activation to further ease the user onboarding process on Google Pay.

The unified payments interface (UPI)-based transactions reached 9.3 billion in June 2022 from 151 million in January 2018, primarily driven by the growth in Person-to-Merchant (P2M) transactions, according to Worldline’s ‘India Digital Payments Report for H1 2022’.

Three UPI apps were dominant in terms of volume and value; PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm (NS: ). In terms of transaction volume in June, thethree apps accounted for 95.68 per cent of all transactions compared to 94.55 per cent a year before.

The technology giant this month launched an earthquake alert system in India that can help people with Android smartphones run to safety when the quake begins.

The system, introduced in consultation with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the National Seismology Center (NSC) in India, uses sensors in Android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes.

Each Android smartphone is equipped with tiny accelerometers that can act as mini seismometers. When a phone is plugged in and charged, it can detect the very beginnings of earthquakes. Google will send two types of alerts: Be Aware and Take Action.

Google in August expanded its generative AI search experience in India and Japan, the first countries outside the US.

The new AI-powered search feature, dubbed SGE (Search Generative Experience), will be available through Google’s Search Labs in these markets and will introduce a new feature aimed at making it easier to find information in its AI-powered overviews.

In India, users will also find a language toggle to help multilingual speakers easily switch back and forth between English and Hindi, and they can also listen to the responses, which is a popular preference. In both countries, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page, the tech giant said.

In June this year, Pichai announced the company will open its global fintech operation centre at GIFT City in Gujarat.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, Pichai said the company will continue to invest in India through its $10 billion digitisation fund.

In December last year, Pichai visited India and pledged support for India's G20 Presidency.

“We’re just beginning to see what the next wave of technology is capable of and how quickly it can improve,“ according to Pichai.

Today, one million people are using generative AI in the Google Workspace to write and create.

Flood forecasting now covers places where more than 460 million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more.

“We’ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change,” he said in a detailed post on the “quarter century of change”.

Still, there is so much more ahead.

Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.

“Making AI more helpful for everyone, and deploying it responsibly, is the most important way we’ll deliver on our mission for the next 10 years and beyond,” Pichai noted.

“Our search for answers will drive extraordinary technology progress over the next 25 years. And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know we succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work,” he emphasised.

An essential truth of innovation is that the moment one pushes the boundary of a technology, it soon goes from extraordinary to ordinary.

“That’s why Google has never taken our success for granted,” according to Pichai.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the CEO and president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, respectively, first wrote down the mission 25 years ago -- to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

“They had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search engine to help people make sense of the waves of information moving online. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions,” said Pichai.

The questions Pichai asked Google have evolved over time: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest route to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying baby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: “How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, Google got much better at answering them.

Search also laid the foundations for Google to make an economic impact beyond its own walls.

“Search is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still our biggest moonshot with so much more to do. Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each,” Pichai noted.

Like most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too.

With Gmail, it was -- could we offer 1GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail launched, that volume of storage was over 100X what most other free webmail services were offering!

“Then a few years later, we saw an opportunity to dramatically improve web browsers — and in turn the web — for people everywhere. So with Chrome we asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its core? Right before launch, I had my own question: Will people use this?”

The questions have kept coming, and Google kept improving and expanding its products with new answers.

Designing products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility.

People have their own questions: Can we trust these new technologies?

“We think deeply about how to build responsible technology from the start, whether it’s making sure everyone’s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online,” the Alphabet CEO said.

2022-09-30, IANS,Indian American judge to decide whether Google@25 will be same at 26,https://in.investing.com/news/indian-american-judge-to-decide-whether-google25-will-be-same-at-26-3830886,"Washington, Sep 30 (IANS) An Indian American federal judge will determine the future of Google (NASDAQ: ) -- the technology giant which is also headed by an Indian American -- in an antitrust trial that’s currently underway in a Washington D.C. court.It’s the largest tech monopoly case of the 21st century that could reshape the search engine giant and the internet as it exists now. It’s being compared in scale to the antitrust trial against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in 1998, which the tech giant lost.

The trial is expected to last three months in the federal court of Judge Amit Mehta, who was born in Patan, Gujarat and came to the US with his parents when he was one. Sunder Pichai, the Google CEO, who was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu (NS: ) and came to the US after his early studies. They are almost the same age; Mehta is 52, older than Pichai by a year. And Judge Mehta will decide the outcome, not a jury.

Google at 25 is facing a moment of reckoning.

“Two decades ago, Google became the darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy start-up with an innovative way to search the emerging internet,” the Justice Department wrote in its 2020 complaint that is the basis of the trial. “That Google is long gone.”

“The Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper for the internet, and one of the wealthiest companies on the planet, with a market value of $1 trillion and annual revenue exceeding $160 billion,” the complaint said further. It’s worth $1.7 trillion now. “For many years, Google has used anti-competitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising—the cornerstones of its empire.”

The Justice Department said the purpose of the complaint is to “restrain Google LLC (Google) from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices, and to remedy the effects of this conduct”.

At the heart of the monopoly complaint is that Google pays billions to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) to make Google the default search engine on their devices and to web browsers like Mozilla. It just does not allow competitors any room to grow.

Google accounts for 95 per cent of search engine usage in the US.

In its defence, Google has argued that people opt to use its search engine because of its superior quality. ""They are not forced to use it and can easily switch to other search engines.""

Thirty-five states and Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have filed a nearly identical lawsuit, which is being processed along with the main complaint filed by the justice department. After the initial hearings that were public, the trial is now proceeding in secrecy as Google and other tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft argued public discussion of their commercial secrets will jeopardize the companies.

The search giant founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin has also faced grilling from lawmakers in the US over the same antitrust concerns.

In 2020, Pichai was questioned at a congressional hearing along with Jeff Bezos of Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Tim Cook of Apple. Republican lawmakers had accused the CEOs of anti-conservative bias at the same hearing.

But the hearing led to nothing very much. Lawmakers merely vented their frustrations, whichever side it fell, and moved on. But the trial in the federal court in Washington DC has the potential to change Google and, indeed, the internet.

2022-09-30, IANS,Google's Bard may get 'Memory' feature to keep details about you,https://in.investing.com/news/googles-bard-may-get-memory-feature-to-keep-details-about-you-3830870,"San Francisco, Sep 30 (IANS) Google’s generative AI chatbot and ChatGPT rival Bard might get a new “Memory” feature that will remember important details about you and your preferences, media report said. According to an early version of Bard’s UI viewed by 9to5Google, the feature will let the AI chatbot keep track of specific details you share with it and use them to improve future results.

This means that you won't need to remind Bard that you avoid eating meat, or that you have two kids -- when prompting for recipes or vacation suggestions.

Moreover, the report said that from the Memory page, you’ll be able to add new preferences.

This same page, presumably, will allow you to delete memories that are incorrect or undesirable.

To maintain privacy, a toggle on the left side of the screen will allow you to quickly and easily turn off Bard's Memory.

This should make it simple to start conversations that aren't based on memories, such as demonstrating Bard to a friend or asking the chatbot about topics you'd prefer it didn't remember the next time, the report explained.

Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ: ) has released a more capable version of Bard that now integrates with Google apps and services, including Gmail, Docs, Drive, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels for more helpful responses.

The company said that it has also improved the “Google it” feature to double-check Bard’s answers, and expanded access to more places.

“This allows your users to work with your most sensitive data from anywhere on their mobile devices while adhering to compliance and regulatory requirements,” the company said in an update late on Friday.

The Gmail mobile apps support encrypted mail natively, so users don't need to download multiple apps, or navigate to an external portal, to access their encrypted messages.

“While Workspace encrypts data at rest and in transit by using secure-by-design cryptographic libraries, client-side encryption ensures that you have sole control over encryption keys and access to your data,” the tech giant explained.

Client-side encryption ensures “sensitive data in the email body and attachments are indecipherable to Google servers” and you retain control over encryption keys and the identity service to access those keys.

To add client-side encryption to any message, click the lock icon and select additional encryption, and compose your message and add attachments as normal.

This feature is available to Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, and Education Standard customers.

Starting this week, teens signed into a Google Account will be able to sign up for Search Labs to access select Labs experiences through the Google app or Chrome desktop.

As the company introduced this new technology to teens, Google said it wants to strike the right balance in creating opportunities for them to benefit from all it has to offer, while also prioritising safety and meeting their developmental needs.

Informed by research and experts in teen development, the company have built additional safeguards into the experience.

The expansion to teenagers comes as Google notes that since the launch of SGE, it has discovered that the experience is more popular among younger users. Google said the most satisfied users are those aged 18 to 24, who the company believes prefer to ask questions in a more conversational tone.

Moreover, Google has introduced a new feature to give users more context about the content they see.

The company has rolled out 'About this result' in SGE, so people who have opted into Search Labs will be able to use this tool on AI-powered responses.

""This will give people helpful context, such as a description of how SGE generated the response, so they can understand more about the underlying technology,"" Google said.

The global survey revealed that 90 per cent of newsrooms are already using some form of AI in news production, 80 per cent in news distribution, and 75 per cent in news gathering.

More than half of the respondents mentioned increased efficiency and enhanced productivity as a reason to use AI as it can automate monotonous and repetitive tasks, according to the report by JournalismAI, an initiative from Polis, the London School of Economics and Political Science’s journalism think tank, supported by the Google (NASDAQ: ) News Initiative.

“Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with artificial intelligence” included the perspective of “more than 120 editors, journalists, technologies and media-makers from 105 small and large newsrooms across 46 countries”.

“Our media landscape is undergoing a significant transformation due to technological advancements, particularly since the proliferation of generative AI (genAI),” said the report.

This transformation has sparked discussions, and various media coverage- topics swing between positive breakthroughs in fields like medicine, to concerns about genAI's potential to generate undetectable disinformation, exacerbating discrimination and societal inequalities.

“Our research delves further into these concerns, and positive uses, and also reveals that genAI is already reshaping the journalism landscape,” the report mentioned.

2022-10-01, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3831542,"Investing.com -- With an eleventh-hour deal reached to avert a U.S. government shutdown investors will be focusing on U.S. jobs data and speeches by Federal Reserve head Jerome Powell and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde in the week ahead. Central banks meeting in Australia and New Zealand will also be in focus and markets continue to digest the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates mantra. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

The U.S. is to release what will be a closely watched employment report for September on Friday with economists expecting the economy to have added jobs last month, slowing slightly from 187,000 in August.

A stronger-than-expected reading could underline the Fed’s ‘higher for longer’ stance, weighing on markets.

Ahead of Friday’s report the for August is due out on Tuesday, followed a day later by an update on from the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report, which is expected to point to moderating jobs growth.

Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management is to release its September on Monday which is expected to remain in contraction territory for an eleventh straight month. The , due Wednesday, is expected to indicate slightly slower growth.

Powell comments

Jay , along with Philadelphia Fed President Patrick is to take part in a roundtable discussion with workers, small business owners, and community leaders on Monday.

Data on Friday indicated progress on inflation, with annual underlying inflation falling below 4% for the first time in over two years, but rising oil prices, which are driving the cost of gasoline at the pump, suggest the road to the Fed's 2% inflation target will be long.

In September, the Fed left rates on hold but indicated that it still expects one more rate hike this year and fewer cuts than previously indicated next year.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta , Atlanta Fed President Raphael and San Francisco Fed President Mary are also set to make appearances during the week.

Equity markets kick off Q4

The all-important final quarter of the year is kicking off after a weak third quarter for stocks.

For the quarter, the fell about 3.6%, the lost 2.6% and the shed 4.1%. In September, the S&P 500 dropped 4.9%, the Dow fell 3.5%, and the Nasdaq declined 5.8%.

Surging bond yields are rattling stock markets, and some investors worry the ballooning valuations of megacap companies, including Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) may be another weak spot.

Shares of tech and growth companies, which often have significant expected profit growth in the years ahead, tend to be hit particularly hard when yields rise because their future projected earnings are discounted more severely.

Q4 though will bring another earnings season and while the AI boom still matters, there are still some questions about the ultimate boost to profits.

Lagarde speech

Christine , the ECB president, is due to make a speech on Wednesday with investors on the lookout for indications on the future path of interest rates after data on Friday showing that Eurozone inflation fell to its lowest level in two years last month.

The data fueled expectations that the ECB has raised rates far enough to bring inflation back down to its 2% target.

Inflation in the bloc briefly hit double digits last autumn amid a combination of soaring energy costs, post-pandemic snags in supply chains and high government spending.

In response, the ECB hiked interest rates to a record-high of 4.0% from a trough of minus 0.5% in just over a year, after a decade spent trying to stimulate inflation via an ultra-easy monetary policy.

RBA, RBNZ meetings

The will hold its first meeting with new governor Michele Bullock, the first woman to head the bank, at the helm on Tuesday.

Investors will be looking for any indications on whether the RBA is done with rate hikes or if more might be coming after some recent indications of persistent price pressures in the service sector. The consensus is for a pause.

Meanwhile, the is to hold its latest policy meeting on Wednesday. Despite the RBNZ’s hawkish stance market watchers are not expecting a rate hike – instead they are focusing on any whether officials may flag a possible move in November.

2022-10-01, IANS,"Freelancers, startups drive demand for co-working spaces in Bengaluru",https://in.investing.com/news/freelancers-startups-drive-demand-for-coworking-spaces-in-bengaluru-3831339,"Bengaluru, Oct 1 (IANS) IT city Bengaluru, which is hailed as a cradle of startups, is witnessing a trend of startups opting for more flexible offices known as co-working spaces.The demand for co-working spaces 2022 is increasing in the city. Bengaluru houses the world’s largest co-working campus in HSR Layout.

Flexible offices or co-working spaces are coming in handy for startups as they save a huge investment of renting, leasing or purchasing the office space. They provide office space as per the requirement, budget and time.

As the trend is catching up, entrepreneurs are also explaining that co-working spaces are also helping in crucial networking.

Co-working presents flexibility in terms of leasing contracts and a variety of options. Geographic flexibility is also a significant asset as co-working spaces are available in premium and easily accessible locations.

Startups can be free of such administrative and operative functions and focus on business.

Hence, co-working can complement the flexibility they desire.Not just processes, but co-working can also substantially reduce the initial costs associated with traditional office leases, rent, utilities, maintenance, and office furnishings.

Ashish Agarwal, Co-founder and CEO of Enzyme Office Space talking to IANS stated, ""The rising demand for flexible offices in India, driven by changing work habits and the growth of startups and freelancers, has made Bengaluru the top city with 39 per cent of operational flex space since 2018, followed by Delhi NCR at 17 per cent.”

Membership plans enable startups to pay only for needed space, reducing leasing and maintenance costs. Co-working spaces bring professionals from various fields together, fostering networking, collaboration, and potential partnerships, he stated.

Ashish Agarwal further explained that startups often begin in co-working spaces for flexibility and transition to private offices as they expand. These offerings make co-working spaces popular for freelancers, startups, remote workers, and established businesses seeking flexible workspaces.

Shesh Paplikar, Founder and CEO of BHIVE Workspace, which established a huge co-working space on the upscale Church Street in Bengaluru recently, explained to IANS, in terms of demand 2022 saw a significant surge in signups because of pent-up demand and 2020 and 2021 were slow. Once the pandemic was contained many organisations wanted to return to office. 2022 is also witnessing a lot of new supply in the co-working industry.

However, the demand has been slightly on the slower side in 2022 when compared to 2022, which was phenomenally good, so overall it seems slightly muted. Having said that, there are still a lot of good, stable companies that are expanding, he opined.

Startups are a bit more cautious at the moment as there is a funding winter. If their burn rate is very high, they are being forced to reduce the burn rate before they can raise more money, which is also leading to a standstill in hiring or layoffs. On the brighter side of things, a lot of global companies are still hiring in India though they are laying off resources abroad. So, the industry is still optimistic about the demand in 2022, Shesh Paplikar explained.

In general, using co-working space increases the agility of any company, not just a startup. However, given that startups usually want to be more agile, scale up or down, pivot around, change strategies, etc., he states.

BHIVE also has the world's largest co-working campus, the BHIVE HSR Campus in Bengaluru. Inspired by Google (NASDAQ: ), BHIVE created a world-class office space that offers additional amenities such as cricket, football, basketball, gym, etc., beyond just office spaces.BHIVE also organises a lot of startup-related events, seminars, networking, investor meets and mentorship programs that add value to the startup ecosystem, Shesh Paplikar states.

Sumit Agarwal, Co-Founder and CEO, of Simply Vyapar Apps Pvt Ltd stated, ""Co-working spaces are always the first preference for any startup as it gives flexibility with customization whenever needed and secondly scalability. Having its own space means huge cash flow which otherwise can be utilised for business expansion.

“We started with 150 seats from Enzyme initially. The way they have curated the space keeping in mind our smallest of the requirements, makes the team unique in terms of delivering as committed. Ashish has been very supportive and accommodating in our journey of scaling from 150 to 1,500 seats to date and more to come in future.""

Natasha Gupta, Founder and CEO, Story Brews Communication, said, ""Cost effective conveniences and flexibility are the key reasons why startups prefer co-working spaces over traditional office rentals. Since, as a startup, we have a hybrid work model in place and we operate in a fast-paced environment, a co-working set-up is not only a great enabler but also provides the right platform to connect, collaborate and be productive.""

""These workspaces offer a one-stop solution with tech-enabled meeting rooms, clean work areas, fresh coffee, housekeeping, etc., the primary things which startups need to function and operate daily. Over and above the co-working spaces are melting pots of like-minded people that create a perfect atmosphere for startups to network,"" Natasha Gupta says.

""Besides, startups like us, who operate with a lean team, find the tailor-made and customization features of co-working beneficial since we get the freedom of choosing the exact number of seats we want, with the provision to expand at any given point in time.”

2022-09-30, IANS,How mega search engines Google was up against just faded away,https://in.investing.com/news/how-mega-search-engines-google-was-up-against-just-faded-away-3830894,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has become synonymous with search engines. When it was first starting out in 1998, however, it was competing with names such as Yahoo, Ask Jeeves and AltaVista for a share of the pie, Straits Times reported.Founded in 1994, Yahoo was once a global leader in e-mail, online news and search until the start of the 21st century.

However, the company was swiftly overtaken by rivals like Gmail and Hotmail in its main search and display ad businesses, while its news aggregation fell behind Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Twitter and other digital channels, the BBC reported.

With most of its revenue coming from selling advertising space, the company’s sales declined as its audience drifted to other platforms, Straits Times reported.

Back when the Internet was mainly used by academia and governments, Mosaic Communications Corporation launched Netscape Navigator, becoming one of the first graphical Web browsers in 1994.

However, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) soon launched the rival Internet Explorer, sparking a tussle to take control of the browser market, Straits Times reported.

Mosaic, which rebranded as Netscape Communications, partnered American Web portal Excite to power its search engine. Netscape was acquired by America Online (AOL) in 1998.

Although AOL officially shuttered Netscape Navigator in 2008, the open-source Mozilla Project founded on Netscape browser’s code continued, eventually birthing the popular Firefox browser, the report said.

Users of the now defunct Internet Explorer will remember MSN Search, which was Microsoft’s default search engine in the 1990s and 2000s.

The service, introduced in 1998, outsourced its search engine to several companies until Microsoft built its own Web crawler.

This was rebranded as Windows Live Search and eventually Bing in 2009.

That year, Microsoft and Yahoo announced a decade-long deal that replaced the Yahoo search engine with Bing, Straits Times reported.

In 2022, Bing was revamped to include a new chatbot feature based on OpenAI’s Chat GPT-4, which helped it hit 100 million active users in March.

AltaVista was one of the earliest search engines to index vast quantities of websites after it was launched in 1995.

The search engine was popular because it had indexed about 20 million webpages, outstripping its rivals at the time, and had fast computers that could swiftly churn results, the BBC reported.

The software was created by computer scientists in the research labs of Digital Equipment Corporation.

In 2001, the number of searches on Google overtook AltaVista, which until then had been one of the top Web destinations.

More than a decade later, Yahoo pulled the plug on the search engine in 2013 along with several products, Straits Times reported.

WebCrawler was reportedly the first search engine to allow users to search for text in any webpage, a method that would become common for major search engines.

It was developed by a University of Washington student Brian Pinkerton during his free time and launched in 1994.

The next year, AOL bought WebCrawler and added its arachnid mascot named Spidey, Straits Times said.

In 1996, the search engine was the second most visited website on the Internet, The Washington Post reported.

But WebCrawler was sold less than two years later in 1997 to Excite, which eventually went bankrupt.

WebCrawler has changed hands several times and continues to exist today, making it one of the oldest surviving search engines, Straits Times reported.

In 1996, the search engine was the second most visited website on the Internet, The Washington Post reported.

The website known as Ask Jeeves was co-founded in 1996 by technologist David Warthern and venture capitalist Garett Gruener, who dreamt of a service that could speak with people using natural language processing, Straits Times reported.

Lacking the necessary technology, the website, named after the fictional butler, morphed into a question-answering service coded to recognise certain words and provide broad answers to these questions, according to The Atlantic.

Its domain was created on November 29, 1995.

By 1999, the website was answering 1 million queries daily, online magazine Mental Floss reported.

As Ask Jeeves expanded in both size and popularity, trouble cropped up. For example, as its question database expanded into the millions, some answers became less relevant, according to online publication Search Engine Watch, Straits Times reported.

By the 2000s, the dot-com bubble had burst, sending advertisers fleeing from Web development and causing millions in losses for the company.

The website was reconfigured to be more search-oriented with a third-party engine, and the company reported a profit in 2003 due to an ad revenue tie-up with Google, according to Mental Floss.

In 2005, it was bought by New York-based InterActive Corp, with Ask Jeeves replaced with the more generic Ask.com the following year, Straits Times reported.

Page was tasked with showing him around – and they disagreed about nearly everything, according to some.But the next year, they formed a partnership that led to the creation of a search engine in their dorms, CBS News reported.

What was formerly called Backrub, a search engine that scoured the internet and ranked pages based on importance, was later named Google.

By August 1998, they had $100,000 from co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim and left the dorms for a garage in Menlo Park, California. Google Inc (NASDAQ: ). got its official start, CBS News reported.

Susan Wojcicki, who later went on to lead YouTube, which Google eventually acquired, owned the garage and became Google's 16th employee.

Google's initial public offering – when it became a publicly traded company – happened in 2004, and several more big business moves have been made since. The company created Gmail, the Android phone and acquired YouTube, to name a few.

One thing that has been consistent with the ever-changing company: Google Doodles. The homepage logo has been turned into ""doodles"" since 1998, when Google marked the Burning Man Festival in Nevada with a doodle that looked like the wooden man burned at the festival.

In 2015, the Google logo got a new font. That same year,Page announced Alphabetwould become Google's holding company. Google remained the search engine,and Alphabet is the parentof all the company's ventures, such as Waymo, the self-driving car company.

Page became CEO of Alphabet and Sundar Pichai was named CEO of Google. In 2019, Pichai also became CEO of Alphabet when Page stepped down and so did Brin as president, CBS News reported.

2022-09-30, IANS,"After being in CCI's crosshairs, Google in Data Protection Bill's shadow",https://in.investing.com/news/after-being-in-ccis-crosshairs-google-in-data-protection-bills-shadow-3830891,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Facing anti-competition lawsuits and complaints globally, Google (NASDAQ: ) in recent years has seen a fiercely-fought battle with the Indian regulators, especially with the Competition Commission of India.Will the new Digital Personal Data Protection Bill (DPDP), the nation's first-ever legislation aimed at safeguarding users’ personal data from Big Tech, make its life tougher?

In the first case of a Big Tech giant paying a heavy penalty to the Indian regulators, Google in August paid the entire penalty amount of Rs 1,337.76 crore imposed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in the Android case. The penalty amount was deposited in the Consolidated Fund of India, within the 30-day deadline given by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in its order.

The Indian market regulator had imposed the penalty on Google in October 2022 for allegedly exploiting its dominant position in the Android market.

The CCI has also imposed a penalty of Rs 936.44 crore on Google in a separate case for abusing its dominant position with respect to its Play Store policies.

Earlier this week, the NCLAT sought responses from Google and the CCI in a plea by Google challenging the penalty of Rs 936.44 crore.

The CCI had penalised Google for alleged abuse of its dominant position in the app store market ecosystem. The NCLAT has now deferred the hearing to November 28.

Earlier this year, in January, the NCLAT had already denied interim relief to Google in this case and rejected its challenge against the penalty. Subsequently, Google took the matter to the Supreme Court but withdrew the appeal in April, opting to continue the case in the NCLAT.

The CCI also directed Google not to engage in anti-competitive activities and mandated the inclusion of third-party billing and payment processing services for in-app purchases.

Dr Ritesh Malik, Director, Alliance for Digital India Foundation (ADIF), said that Big Tech firms started taking the fines/penalties as 'cost of doing business' and preferred to pay the same rather than making the ecosystem more fair and non-discriminative.

""It is important to note that Google has made the payment after spending all possible avenues, including reaching out to the Supreme Court and the NCLAT. The paramount concern is whether Google is complying with the CCI rulings in letter and spirit,"" Malik said.

With the DPDP Bill, 2022, becoming a reality, experts say that forthcoming rules under the new law will empower Indian users about how Big Tech companies like Google, Meta (NASDAQ: ) or X can or cannot use their data.

""The Act aims to concretise the efforts that Big Tech, and data fiduciaries in general, must now undertake towards respecting the users' privacy rights and control over their personal data. This will now entail transparently informing the users about the specific purposes of data processing, while also obtaining clear and precise user consent that may be later withdrawn,"" according to Harsh Walia, Partner at Khaitan & Co.

The users may also request erasure of their data. Moreover, the principle of data minimisation will require collection of only that personal data which is necessary for the specified purpose.

According to experts, the success of the data protection law will be determined by when and how new rules are made and how effectively they are implemented.

""It is also necessary to understand what will be the status of the old IT rules till the new rules are made. Also, we need to see how effective will be the practical mechanism for redressal of common people's grievances as per India's new law on foreign tech companies,"" Virag Gupta, Supreme Court lawyer and cyber law expert, told IANS.

With the ban on illegal data business, according to the new law, if tax is collected from the data business, then both, society and the economy will be strengthened, Gupta stressed.

The Bill has provisions for hefty penalties ranging from a minimum fine of Rs 50 crore to a maximum of Rs 250 crore on big internet companies' platforms for violating rules to enable digital markets to grow more responsibly while safeguarding citizens' data.

The DPDP Bill is certainly a legislation that will create a deep lasting behavioural change and create high penalty punitive consequences for any or all platforms that misuse or exploit the personal data of any Indian citizen, according to Minister of State for Electronics and IT, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

""For many years, it has been known that many platforms, companies or data fiduciaries have been collecting personal data of individual citizens, not just in India but all around the world and have been exploiting that personal data for their own business models, algorithms, and many other ways,"" he said in a video message recently.

This has been done without the awareness or the agreement of the person whose personal data it was.

""This is certainly legislation that will create a deep lasting behavioural change and create punitive consequences, high-penalty punitive consequences for any or all platforms that misuse or exploit the personal data of any Indian citizen,"" the minister had stressed.

2022-09-30, IANS,Can Google rule super-competitive smartphone market with Pixel?,https://in.investing.com/news/can-google-rule-supercompetitive-smartphone-market-with-pixel-3830890,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ), which has been a market leader in online search and other product categories for decades, is yet to cement its place in the global smartphone industry despite the popularity of the Google Pixel brand.According to Statista Consumer Insights released in May, Google remains a niche player in the smartphone market, with less than five per cent of smartphone users calling a Google device their main phone in most major markets.

However, a recent report by Counterpoint Research showed that the Google smartphone market grew in Japan, making the brand number two in the country.

Google achieved 9 per cent of the market share in the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, surpassing local brands to secure the second position after Apple (NASDAQ: ), which has historically dominated the market with over 50 per cent share.

The recently launched Pixel 7a showed a 74 per cent increase in sales when compared to its predecessor.

According to industry experts, when it comes to India, the smartphone market offers significant headroom for growth in the country.

To succeed in this hypercompetitive market and win over demanding consumers requires an intricate dance between cutting-edge innovation and a deep understanding of the heartbeat of the market.

""Google’s upcoming Pixel phones are poised to build on the exceptional camera capabilities and seamless software experience of previous generation Pixel phones. If competitively priced and supported by aggressive go-to-market initiatives, the new Pixel phones have the potential to make significant strides in India,"" Prabhu Ram, Head of Industry Intelligence Group, CMR, told IANS.

""With good after-sales support, they can carve a niche amid the demands of India's discerning consumers. The strong premiumisation wave provides good tailwinds,"" he added.

Google debuted the ‘Made by Google’ Pixel smartphones in 2016 globally, including India. In the coming years, it launched Pixel 2 series, and Pixel 3 series in the country.

In 2019, Google decided not to release the Pixel 4 and instead released the Pixel 3A in May of that year.

In 2021, Google launched the Pixel 6 series and last year launched the Pixel 7 series.

Now, Google is set to launch Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro devices globally on October 4. The Pixel 8 is expected to feature a 6.2-inch display, Tensor G3 processor, and 50MP+12MP rear camera set-up, while the Pixel 8 Pro may come with a large 6.7-inch display, Tensor G3 processor and feature a triple camera set-up with a 64MP and a 48MP ultra-wide-angle camera.

In Q4 2022, Google overtook Samsung (KS: ) to become the number two brand in the global smartwatch market, showing significant growth while competing with market leaders. Apple continued to lead and dominate the market globally, according to Canalys report.

2022-09-30, IANS,"Looking ahead, Google bets big on monetising YouTube, Shorts in India",https://in.investing.com/news/looking-ahead-google-bets-big-on-monetising-youtube-shorts-in-india-3830889,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) As Google-owned YouTube becomes a foremost choice for streaming for most Indians as well as creating content, the tech giant is now in the process to monetise the platform in a big way, while helping the creator economy grow in leap and bound.

YouTube has now become the platform of choice for four out of every five people online in India while its short-video-making app called Shorts has grown in popularity, with 96 per cent aged 18 to 44 in the country using YouTube Shorts.

With an average of 70 billion daily views globally, YouTube Shorts continues to grow in popularity among viewers in India, according to the company.

In February, Google (NASDAQ: ) officially started ad revenue sharing on YouTube Shorts with creators to compete with Instagram Reels. Earlier, creators were only allowed to monetise long-form content on the platform.

Shorts watch-time now also surpassed devices with 88 per cent of online 18-44-year-olds watching short-form video content on a TV over the past 12 months in the country.

“In the 15 years since we launched YouTube in India, there has been an extraordinary all-round digital transformation, in connectivity and in content, and today, people have created a boundaryless viewer experience for themselves that straddles across their smartphones and their connected TVs,” said Satya Raghavan, Director, Marketing Partners, Google India.

Together with the total hours of content uploaded to YouTube by channels in India growing by over 40 per cent in 2022 compared to June 2022, 35+ adults averaged over 70 minutes of YouTube per day in that month.

As creators begin to tap gen AI for new ideas and audiences, the year has seen over 1.7 billion views of videos related to or using generative AI tools globally.

About 70 per cent of 18-44 year-old viewers online agree that they are open to watching content from creators that use AI to generate their content.

Google recently launched ""YouTube Courses"" -- a new way for creators in India to monetise their content while educating people.

YouTube Courses is an online medium to share learning materials in the form of videos. It will also incorporate PDF and other files for reference.

According to Google, the creator's economy of YouTube contributed Rs 10,000 crores to the Indian GDP in 2021 and simultaneously created 7.5 million new forms of employment.

Last year, YouTube announced a new programme that will allow creators to monetise their long-form videos with licensed music in 2022.

The company has introduced 'Creator Music', giving YouTube creators easy access to an ever-growing catalogue of music for use in their long-form videos.

YouTube Shorts has more than 2 billion logged-in monthly users, Google mentioned in its results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2022. This figure is up from 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users for YouTube Shorts announced last year.

Google also reported that YouTube brought in $7.67 billion in advertising revenue. This is 4 per cent higher than the same period last year.

YouTube was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. In October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.

2022-09-30, IANS,"Since its entry in 2004, Google has driven pace of tech change in India",https://in.investing.com/news/since-its-entry-in-2004-google-has-driven-pace-of-tech-change-in-india-3830888,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) India started with five employees in 2004 and since then, it has grown to be among the largest Google employee bases outside of the US.

As smartphones have brought millions more online, Indians have become some of the most enthusiastic Google users. Using products like Gmail, Translate and Android, India is second only to the US in total number of mobile 'Search' queries.

Search in 2003 started in English but the company quickly added Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil and many other languages going forward.

India's digital transformation is at a tipping point and millions of connected Indians, affordable smartphones and data, record highs in digital payments, the digitisation of citizen services, and a vibrant startup ecosystem have put the technology sector on track to become the single largest contributor to the national economy.

With this in mind, Google introduced India-first innovations, worked to lower barriers to access, and invested in strengthening the strategic pillars of India’s digital economy through its $10 billion (approximately Rs 75,000 crore) India Digitisation Fund that was announced in 2020.

The company is investing the money in the country via a mix of equity investments, partnerships, and operational, infrastructure and ecosystem investments.

According to Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, the pace of technological change in India has been extraordinary, and there’s so much opportunity still ahead.

“We’re helping to advance India’s digital future. That includes our efforts to build a single, unified AI model that will be capable of handling over 100 Indian languages across speech and text – part of our global effort to bring the world’s 1,000 most-spoken languages online, and to help people access knowledge and information in their preferred language,” Pichai said in December last year.

Google Pay has completed more than five years in India. At Google Pay, the company used advanced methods in our safety engine that analyze aggregate transaction patterns of millions of users, relating this to a graph of a billion nodes.

The company also introduced a useful new feature in Google Pay that makes it easier than ever to access transaction history.

In June, Google partnered with the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to enable Aadhaar-based authentication for UPI activation to further ease the user onboarding process on Google Pay.

The unified payments interface (UPI)-based transactions reached 9.3 billion in June 2022 from 151 million in January 2018, primarily driven by the growth in Person-to-Merchant (P2M) transactions, according to Worldline’s ‘India Digital Payments Report for H1 2022’.

Three UPI apps were dominant in terms of volume and value; PhonePe, Google Pay and Paytm (NS: ). In terms of transaction volume in June, thethree apps accounted for 95.68 per cent of all transactions compared to 94.55 per cent a year before.

The technology giant this month launched an earthquake alert system in India that can help people with Android smartphones run to safety when the quake begins.

The system, introduced in consultation with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the National Seismology Center (NSC) in India, uses sensors in Android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes.

Each Android smartphone is equipped with tiny accelerometers that can act as mini seismometers. When a phone is plugged in and charged, it can detect the very beginnings of earthquakes. Google will send two types of alerts: Be Aware and Take Action.

Google in August expanded its generative AI search experience in India and Japan, the first countries outside the US.

The new AI-powered search feature, dubbed SGE (Search Generative Experience), will be available through Google’s Search Labs in these markets and will introduce a new feature aimed at making it easier to find information in its AI-powered overviews.

In India, users will also find a language toggle to help multilingual speakers easily switch back and forth between English and Hindi, and they can also listen to the responses, which is a popular preference. In both countries, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page, the tech giant said.

In June this year, Pichai announced the company will open its global fintech operation centre at GIFT City in Gujarat.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, Pichai said the company will continue to invest in India through its $10 billion digitisation fund.

In December last year, Pichai visited India and pledged support for India's G20 Presidency.

2022-09-30, IANS,"Pichai's Prediction: AI to write Google's next 25 years, lift people's lives",https://in.investing.com/news/pichais-prediction-ai-to-write-googles-next-25-years-lift-peoples-lives-3830887,"New Delhi, Sep 30 (IANS) For Alphabet and Google (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai, the next 25 years are crucial as with artificial intelligence (AI), the company has the opportunity to do things that matter on an even larger scale.As Google looks ahead, the Indian-origin tech mogul has been reflecting on the commitment from the original founder’s letter in 2004: “to develop services that improve the lives of as many people as possible — to do things that matter.”

“We’re just beginning to see what the next wave of technology is capable of and how quickly it can improve,“ according to Pichai.

Today, one million people are using generative AI in the Google Workspace to write and create.

Flood forecasting now covers places where more than 460 million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more.

“We’ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change,” he said in a detailed post on the “quarter century of change”.

Still, there is so much more ahead.

Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. It’s bigger than the shift from desktop computing to mobile, and it may be bigger than the internet itself. It’s a fundamental rewiring of technology and an incredible accelerant of human ingenuity.

“Making AI more helpful for everyone, and deploying it responsibly, is the most important way we’ll deliver on our mission for the next 10 years and beyond,” Pichai noted.

“Our search for answers will drive extraordinary technology progress over the next 25 years. And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know we succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work,” he emphasised.

An essential truth of innovation is that the moment one pushes the boundary of a technology, it soon goes from extraordinary to ordinary.

“That’s why Google has never taken our success for granted,” according to Pichai.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the CEO and president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, respectively, first wrote down the mission 25 years ago -- to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.

“They had an ambitious vision for a new kind of search engine to help people make sense of the waves of information moving online. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions,” said Pichai.

The questions Pichai asked Google have evolved over time: “How do you fix a dripping faucet?” “Fastest route to Stanford Hospital?” “Ways to calm a crying baby?” And right around spring of 2003, perhaps: “How to ace a Google interview?” And over time, Google got much better at answering them.

Search also laid the foundations for Google to make an economic impact beyond its own walls.

“Search is still at the core of our mission, and it’s still our biggest moonshot with so much more to do. Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each,” Pichai noted.

Like most Google searches, all those products started with a question, too.

With Gmail, it was -- could we offer 1GB of storage to every person? In 2004, when Gmail launched, that volume of storage was over 100X what most other free webmail services were offering!

“Then a few years later, we saw an opportunity to dramatically improve web browsers — and in turn the web — for people everywhere. So with Chrome we asked: Could we build a browser that made the web better, with simplicity, speed, and security at its core? Right before launch, I had my own question: Will people use this?”

The questions have kept coming, and Google kept improving and expanding its products with new answers.

Designing products that help people at scale is both a privilege and a responsibility.

People have their own questions: Can we trust these new technologies?

“We think deeply about how to build responsible technology from the start, whether it’s making sure everyone’s information is protected and secure, or keeping people safe from bad actors online,” the Alphabet CEO said.

2022-09-30, IANS,Indian American judge to decide whether Google@25 will be same at 26,https://in.investing.com/news/indian-american-judge-to-decide-whether-google25-will-be-same-at-26-3830886,"Washington, Sep 30 (IANS) An Indian American federal judge will determine the future of Google (NASDAQ: ) -- the technology giant which is also headed by an Indian American -- in an antitrust trial that’s currently underway in a Washington D.C. court.It’s the largest tech monopoly case of the 21st century that could reshape the search engine giant and the internet as it exists now. It’s being compared in scale to the antitrust trial against Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) in 1998, which the tech giant lost.

The trial is expected to last three months in the federal court of Judge Amit Mehta, who was born in Patan, Gujarat and came to the US with his parents when he was one. Sunder Pichai, the Google CEO, who was born in Madurai, Tamil Nadu (NS: ) and came to the US after his early studies. They are almost the same age; Mehta is 52, older than Pichai by a year. And Judge Mehta will decide the outcome, not a jury.

Google at 25 is facing a moment of reckoning.

“Two decades ago, Google became the darling of Silicon Valley as a scrappy start-up with an innovative way to search the emerging internet,” the Justice Department wrote in its 2020 complaint that is the basis of the trial. “That Google is long gone.”

“The Google of today is a monopoly gatekeeper for the internet, and one of the wealthiest companies on the planet, with a market value of $1 trillion and annual revenue exceeding $160 billion,” the complaint said further. It’s worth $1.7 trillion now. “For many years, Google has used anti-competitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising—the cornerstones of its empire.”

The Justice Department said the purpose of the complaint is to “restrain Google LLC (Google) from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising, and general search text advertising in the United States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices, and to remedy the effects of this conduct”.

At the heart of the monopoly complaint is that Google pays billions to companies such as Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung (KS: ) to make Google the default search engine on their devices and to web browsers like Mozilla. It just does not allow competitors any room to grow.

Google accounts for 95 per cent of search engine usage in the US.

In its defence, Google has argued that people opt to use its search engine because of its superior quality. ""They are not forced to use it and can easily switch to other search engines.""

Thirty-five states and Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have filed a nearly identical lawsuit, which is being processed along with the main complaint filed by the justice department. After the initial hearings that were public, the trial is now proceeding in secrecy as Google and other tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft argued public discussion of their commercial secrets will jeopardize the companies.

The search giant founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin has also faced grilling from lawmakers in the US over the same antitrust concerns.

In 2020, Pichai was questioned at a congressional hearing along with Jeff Bezos of Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Tim Cook of Apple. Republican lawmakers had accused the CEOs of anti-conservative bias at the same hearing.

But the hearing led to nothing very much. Lawmakers merely vented their frustrations, whichever side it fell, and moved on. But the trial in the federal court in Washington DC has the potential to change Google and, indeed, the internet.

According to an early version of Bard’s UI viewed by 9to5Google, the feature will let the AI chatbot keep track of specific details you share with it and use them to improve future results.

This means that you won't need to remind Bard that you avoid eating meat, or that you have two kids -- when prompting for recipes or vacation suggestions.

Moreover, the report said that from the Memory page, you’ll be able to add new preferences.

This same page, presumably, will allow you to delete memories that are incorrect or undesirable.

To maintain privacy, a toggle on the left side of the screen will allow you to quickly and easily turn off Bard's Memory.

This should make it simple to start conversations that aren't based on memories, such as demonstrating Bard to a friend or asking the chatbot about topics you'd prefer it didn't remember the next time, the report explained.

Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ: ) has released a more capable version of Bard that now integrates with Google apps and services, including Gmail, Docs, Drive, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels for more helpful responses.

The company said that it has also improved the “Google it” feature to double-check Bard’s answers, and expanded access to more places.

“This allows your users to work with your most sensitive data from anywhere on their mobile devices while adhering to compliance and regulatory requirements,” the company said in an update late on Friday.

The Gmail mobile apps support encrypted mail natively, so users don't need to download multiple apps, or navigate to an external portal, to access their encrypted messages.

“While Workspace encrypts data at rest and in transit by using secure-by-design cryptographic libraries, client-side encryption ensures that you have sole control over encryption keys and access to your data,” the tech giant explained.

Client-side encryption ensures “sensitive data in the email body and attachments are indecipherable to Google servers” and you retain control over encryption keys and the identity service to access those keys.

To add client-side encryption to any message, click the lock icon and select additional encryption, and compose your message and add attachments as normal.

This feature is available to Google Workspace Enterprise Plus, Education Plus, and Education Standard customers.

Starting this week, teens signed into a Google Account will be able to sign up for Search Labs to access select Labs experiences through the Google app or Chrome desktop.

As the company introduced this new technology to teens, Google said it wants to strike the right balance in creating opportunities for them to benefit from all it has to offer, while also prioritising safety and meeting their developmental needs.

Informed by research and experts in teen development, the company have built additional safeguards into the experience.

The expansion to teenagers comes as Google notes that since the launch of SGE, it has discovered that the experience is more popular among younger users. Google said the most satisfied users are those aged 18 to 24, who the company believes prefer to ask questions in a more conversational tone.

Moreover, Google has introduced a new feature to give users more context about the content they see.

The company has rolled out 'About this result' in SGE, so people who have opted into Search Labs will be able to use this tool on AI-powered responses.

""This will give people helpful context, such as a description of how SGE generated the response, so they can understand more about the underlying technology,"" Google said.

More than half of the respondents mentioned increased efficiency and enhanced productivity as a reason to use AI as it can automate monotonous and repetitive tasks, according to the report by JournalismAI, an initiative from Polis, the London School of Economics and Political Science’s journalism think tank, supported by the Google (NASDAQ: ) News Initiative.

“Generating Change: A global survey of what news organisations are doing with artificial intelligence” included the perspective of “more than 120 editors, journalists, technologies and media-makers from 105 small and large newsrooms across 46 countries”.

“Our media landscape is undergoing a significant transformation due to technological advancements, particularly since the proliferation of generative AI (genAI),” said the report.

This transformation has sparked discussions, and various media coverage- topics swing between positive breakthroughs in fields like medicine, to concerns about genAI's potential to generate undetectable disinformation, exacerbating discrimination and societal inequalities.

“Our research delves further into these concerns, and positive uses, and also reveals that genAI is already reshaping the journalism landscape,” the report mentioned.

The tech giant's projects Bristlecone and Sandbox AQ are expected to substantially boost Google's advertising revenue.

On the heels of this development, Alphabet launched Bard Extensions, a new tool for data retrieval, despite facing stiff competition from Microsoft-OpenAI. This move illustrates Alphabet's unwavering commitment to innovation and efficiency-driven decisions.

Institutional investors seem to share this confidence in Alphabet's future, as reflected by their ownership of 27.13% of the company's shares. Insider transactions, such as the recent share sale by Ann Mather, further underscore this sentiment.

Alphabet's financial health remains robust, as evidenced by its $2 trillion market cap. The company's strong valuation ratios and encouraging Q2 2022 results indicate a recovery in its digital ad business and potential advancements in AI.

These developments highlight Alphabet's continued growth and dominance in the tech industry, with a particular focus on quantum computing and AI. The company's strategic decisions and innovative projects are expected to further strengthen its position in the market.

The Google-owned smartphone brand has achieved a record 12% market share in the June quarter, marking a sixfold improvement from the same period last year.

The surge in Google Pixel's popularity comes after years of underwhelming performance and misfires in the Japanese market. Counterpoint Research, which provided the data, did not detail what led to this sudden upswing. It is clear that Google Pixel's gain has come at the expense of iPhone's market share.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which has long been a dominant player in Japan, saw its market share drop almost equivalently from 58% to 46%. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's market cap stands at a staggering $2.66 trillion with a P/E ratio of 28.48, indicating a strong market performance despite the recent decline in Japan. This decline coincides with the increasing price tags of iPhone models, although it remains unclear whether there is a direct correlation between these two events.

InvestingPro Tips reveals that Apple has been aggressively buying back shares and yields a high return on invested capital. Additionally, the company's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be an attractive feature for investors.

This shift in market dynamics indicates a changing landscape in Japan's smartphone industry. Although Apple still retains a significant portion of the market, the rise of Google Pixel suggests that Japanese consumers are exploring other options.

Google, with a market cap of $1.65 trillion and a P/E ratio of 27.66 according to InvestingPro data, has seen a large price uptick over the last six months. The company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has been a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry.

InvestingPro Tips for Google highlights that the company yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets. However, it's worth noting that Google does not pay a dividend to shareholders, unlike Apple.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,"Tech wreck temporary as earnings season, Fed cuts will spur rebound, Wedbush says",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-wreck-temporary-as-earnings-season-fed-cuts-will-spur-rebound-wedbush-says-3827167,"Investing.com – Tech stocks have suffered a bumpy ride in September as the road to higher rates for longer has rejuvenated the bears, but Wedbush argues, this weakness will prove to be a temporary joyride as the upcoming earnings season for big tech and fed cuts next year will trigger a rebound in growth across tech.

“Our bullish stance on tech is unchanged despite market fears,” Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, a tech bull, said in a note Wednesday, highlighting various positive factors for the industry including the growth of artificial intelligence, cloud, and a rebound in ad-spending.

Market 'obsession' with rates soon in rearview mirror as Fed cuts on horizon

Tech (NYSE: ), which is down about 5% over the past month, has been pressured by the hawkish Federal Reserve meeting earlier in September that has pushed Treasury yields to levels not seen since the global financial crisis in 2007. Rising rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

But the current rate scare, and the “obsession” with the will dissipate as the Federal Reserve cuts rates in 2024, leading to a soft a landing, Wedbush added.

The Fed's latest projections on the path of interest rates, released last week, showed the Fed members revised the number of rate cuts for next year to two from four previously. As well as the fewer rate cuts, the Fed maintained its outlook for another rate hike for this year, forcing markets to reprice in a higher for longer interest rate environment.

The fundamentals for tech, meanwhile, are yet to be priced in, Wedbush argues, pointing to “transformational growth” of artificial intelligence, cloud, cyber security, and rebound in the digital advertising market.

'Generational' AI growth set to drive tech spending

Wedbush believes the upcoming earnings season from big tech will not only be positive but also serve as “sneak peak” for what’s to come in 2024. Central to that theme, is AI, which will continue to spur a massive of wave of enterprise spending on hyperscale, or AI-related data center infrastructure – used to power AI models like ChatGPT – benefitting Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

""While this 3Q tech earnings cycle will not in itself turn the negative bearish sentiment away, we expect a positive earnings season for Big Tech which we view as a sneak preview for a major rebound in growth across the tech sector in 2024 with a soft landing backdrop,"" Wedbush added.

Wedbush is not alone in talking up the promise of AI. JPMorgan believes the AI hype is real and it’s here to stay.

“They’ve come off the boil since July, but there’s still a lot of optimism regarding AI’s impact on growth, profits and productivity,” {{0|JPMorgan said in its published outlook on Sept. 26, referring to the recent weakness in AI-related stocks."
2022-09-27, IANS,Explained: This is how Google earthquake alert system will work in India,https://in.investing.com/news/explained-this-is-how-google-earthquake-alert-system-will-work-in-india-3826698,"New Delhi, Sep 27 (IANS) One of the most frequent natural disasters are earthquakes, which is why having an early warning system can be vital in ensuring people's safety, and to address this issue, Google (NASDAQ: ) has introduced an ""Android Earthquake Alert System"" in India to provide users with an early warning when earthquake shaking begins. The alert system will use sensors in Android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes and warn users if such an event occurs.

Android has two types of notifications designed to alert users about an earthquake -- Be Aware Alert and Take Action Alert. Both alert types will only sent for earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or above.

'Be Aware Alert' is designed to give you a heads-up for light shaking and provide more information when you tap on the notification.

This alert will only be sent to users who will experience MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity) 3 & 4 shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or above.

MMI is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the intensity of shaking produced by an earthquake. Be Aware Alert will respect the volume, do not disturb and notification settings on your device, meaning it will not break through these settings to alert.

'Take Action Alert' is designed to get your attention before you experience moderate to heavy shaking so that you can take action to protect yourself.

This alert will only be sent to users who will experience MMI 5+ shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater.

Take Action Alert will break through the do not disturb settings, turn on your screen and play a loud sound to alert.

Upon tapping on either alert, you will be presented with earthquake safety information, which consists of simple steps you can take to keep yourself and others safe.

The alert system is also designed to be easy to read and follow and is available in Indian languages supported by Android.

It is rolling out to all Android 5+ users in India during the coming week.

To receive alerts, users must have Wi-Fi and/or cellular data connectivity, and both Android Earthquake Alerts and location settings enabled.

Users who do not wish to receive these alerts can turn off Earthquake Alerts in device settings.

Earthquakes are one of the most common natural disasters in the world, and an early warning can be pivotal in helping people prepare and get themselves and their loved ones to safety.

The system, introduced in consultation with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the National Seismology Center (NSC) in India, uses sensors in android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes.

Each android smartphone is equipped with tiny accelerometers that can act as mini seismometers.

When a phone is plugged in and charging, it can detect the very beginnings of earthquakes.

Google sends two types of alerts: Be Aware and Take Action.

The “Be Aware” alerts are sent to users exercising MMI 3 & 4 shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater.

It just shows an alert on screen and doesn’t play any sound if your phone is on Do Not Disturb mode or in silent mode.

The alerts are sent to users experiencing MMI 5+ shaking during an earthquake of 4.5 magnitude. In this case, the alert will bypass system’s notification settings, including Do No Disturb, and play a loud sound.

“If many phones detect earthquake-like tremors around the same time, our server can use this information to estimate that an earthquake may be happening, as well as characteristics of the event -- like its epicentre and magnitude. Then, our server can send alerts to nearby phones,” Micah Berman, Product Manager, Android Safety at Google, wrote in a blog post.

“Internet signals travel at the speed of light, much faster than the propagation of earthquake shaking through the ground, so the alerts often reach phones several seconds before severe shaking does,” he added.

The feature, already deployed in many countries around the world, will be rolled out to all Android 5+ users in India in the coming week.

The alerts are designed to be easy to read and follow, and are available in Indian languages supported by android.

To receive alerts, users must have Wi-Fi and/or cellular data connectivity, and both android earthquake alerts and location settings enabled.

Users who do not wish to receive these alerts can turn off earthquake alerts in device settings.

The system also provides information through Google Search about local seismic events and safety measures when people search for information with queries like “Earthquake near me.”

2022-09-26, Investing.com,Broadcom Partners with Google Cloud to Strengthen Gen AI-Powered Cybersecurity,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/broadcom-partners-with-google-cloud-to-strengthen-gen-aipowered-cybersecurity-432SI-3824562,"Symantec, a division of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: ), is partnering with Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud to embed generative AI (gen AI) into the Symantec Security platform in a phased rollout that will give customers a significant technical edge for detecting, understanding, and remediating sophisticated cyber attacks.

Symantec is leveraging the Google Cloud Security AI Workbench and security-specific large language model (LLM)--Sec-PaLM 2–across its portfolio to enable natural language interfaces and generate more comprehensive and easy-to-understand threat analyses. With Security AI Workbench-powered summarization of complex incidents and alignment to MITRE ATT&CK context, security operations center (SOC) analysts of all levels can better understand threats and be able to respond faster. That, in turn, translates into greater security and higher SOC productivity.

“Symantec has a long history of designing, implementing, and fine-tuning artificial intelligence and machine learning for critical security use cases and helping our customers drive value out of AI,” said Adam Bromwich, CTO and Head of Engineering, Symantec Enterprise Division, Broadcom. “Our partnership with Google Cloud is part of that continuing journey to put the most innovative security solutions possible into user hands. Our engineers have simplified the process in ways that will enable customers to be much more productive and effective. This is just the beginning of a great collaboration that will help to kickstart the benefits of AI throughout the broader security ecosystem.”

Symantec + Google Cloud: Collaboration Between Industry Leaders

The Symantec and Google Cloud collaboration brings together two of technology’s most accomplished innovators to address a growing cybersecurity talent gap: as the enterprise attack surface expands and becomes more complex, companies struggle to hire security analysts with deep expertise. Symantec’s products will help compensate for this skills shortage, providing less experienced staff with assistive features that summarize threat information in natural language and offer easy ways to operate security products without requiring staffers to learn difficult syntaxes.

Google Cloud has been a key partner in accelerating Broadcom’s growth strategy for several years. Broadcom successfully migrated Symantec Cloud Secure Web Gateway (SWG) and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) onto Google Cloud. Broadcom also modernized the security stack and standardized service delivery processes and offerings on Google Cloud infrastructure, allowing the company to scale and operate more efficiently to better serve enterprise customers.

“Google Cloud and Symantec are working together to deliver AI-infused security that makes threat detection faster and more actionable for all levels of security analysts,” said Sunil Potti, GM and VP of Cloud Security at Google Cloud. “Together, Google Cloud and Symantec are helping to optimize the effectiveness of security controls while removing the manual drudgery that slows implementation, policy tuning, and response times.”

Symantec’s long history and expertise with security-targeted AI and ML, along with Google Cloud’s scale and rich gen AI models, is a powerful combination for customers protecting complex environments. As part of the partnership, Symantec shared query language samples with Google Cloud to help its Sec-PaLM 2 LLM better interact with its specific systems—resulting in improved workflows. Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network provides deep visibility into threats and customers will be able to leverage this telemetry more effectively with advances in gen AI.

“All security vendors will likely embed generative AI into their solutions if they haven’t done so already,” said Frank Dickson, Group Vice President, Security & Trust at IDC. “True innovators will have a deep understanding of how to tap into the predictive models behind generative AI to produce better security data and enable better outcomes. Companies with rich sets of data and expertise in AI/ML are certainly worth keeping an eye on.”

Google Cloud Security AI Workbench to Speed and Enhance Symantec Security Solutions

This initial phase of gen AI adoption requires no updates on products or processes and uses Symantec’s existing externally facing sites. Existing customers can benefit from the enhanced security provided by new features now available for Symantec solutions:

Rapid access to enhanced and descriptive threat descriptions

Easy-to-understand descriptions of the actions performed by malicious scripts and complex machine code (assembly variants - Intel, ARM, etc.)

Increased performance and throughput to identify malicious binary files

Closed loop systems that ensure all output is vetted by a human analyst

2022-09-28, Investing.com,Google Pixel chips away at iPhone's dominance in Japan,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pixel-chips-away-at-iphones-dominance-in-japan-93CH-3827483,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google Pixel has made significant strides in the Japanese market, eroding the dominance of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).'s iPhone, according to data released on Thursday. The Google-owned smartphone brand has achieved a record 12% market share in the June quarter, marking a sixfold improvement from the same period last year.

The surge in Google Pixel's popularity comes after years of underwhelming performance and misfires in the Japanese market. Counterpoint Research, which provided the data, did not detail what led to this sudden upswing. It is clear that Google Pixel's gain has come at the expense of iPhone's market share.

Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which has long been a dominant player in Japan, saw its market share drop almost equivalently from 58% to 46%. According to InvestingPro data, Apple's market cap stands at a staggering $2.66 trillion with a P/E ratio of 28.48, indicating a strong market performance despite the recent decline in Japan. This decline coincides with the increasing price tags of iPhone models, although it remains unclear whether there is a direct correlation between these two events.

InvestingPro Tips reveals that Apple has been aggressively buying back shares and yields a high return on invested capital. Additionally, the company's strong earnings should allow management to continue dividend payments. Apple has raised its dividend for 11 consecutive years, which may be an attractive feature for investors.

This shift in market dynamics indicates a changing landscape in Japan's smartphone industry. Although Apple still retains a significant portion of the market, the rise of Google Pixel suggests that Japanese consumers are exploring other options.

Google, with a market cap of $1.65 trillion and a P/E ratio of 27.66 according to InvestingPro data, has seen a large price uptick over the last six months. The company holds more cash than debt on its balance sheet and has been a prominent player in the Interactive Media & Services industry.

InvestingPro Tips for Google highlights that the company yields a high return on invested capital and operates with a high return on assets. However, it's worth noting that Google does not pay a dividend to shareholders, unlike Apple.

2022-09-27, Investing.com,"Tech wreck temporary as earnings season, Fed cuts will spur rebound, Wedbush says",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-wreck-temporary-as-earnings-season-fed-cuts-will-spur-rebound-wedbush-says-3827167,"Investing.com – Tech stocks have suffered a bumpy ride in September as the road to higher rates for longer has rejuvenated the bears, but Wedbush argues, this weakness will prove to be a temporary joyride as the upcoming earnings season for big tech and fed cuts next year will trigger a rebound in growth across tech.

“Our bullish stance on tech is unchanged despite market fears,” Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, a tech bull, said in a note Wednesday, highlighting various positive factors for the industry including the growth of artificial intelligence, cloud, and a rebound in ad-spending.

Market 'obsession' with rates soon in rearview mirror as Fed cuts on horizon

Tech (NYSE: ), which is down about 5% over the past month, has been pressured by the hawkish Federal Reserve meeting earlier in September that has pushed Treasury yields to levels not seen since the global financial crisis in 2007. Rising rates make future profit appear less valuable, and the impact is particularly acute in higher-priced growth sectors including tech.

But the current rate scare, and the “obsession” with the will dissipate as the Federal Reserve cuts rates in 2024, leading to a soft a landing, Wedbush added.

The Fed's latest projections on the path of interest rates, released last week, showed the Fed members revised the number of rate cuts for next year to two from four previously. As well as the fewer rate cuts, the Fed maintained its outlook for another rate hike for this year, forcing markets to reprice in a higher for longer interest rate environment.

The fundamentals for tech, meanwhile, are yet to be priced in, Wedbush argues, pointing to “transformational growth” of artificial intelligence, cloud, cyber security, and rebound in the digital advertising market.

'Generational' AI growth set to drive tech spending

Wedbush believes the upcoming earnings season from big tech will not only be positive but also serve as “sneak peak” for what’s to come in 2024. Central to that theme, is AI, which will continue to spur a massive of wave of enterprise spending on hyperscale, or AI-related data center infrastructure – used to power AI models like ChatGPT – benefitting Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

""While this 3Q tech earnings cycle will not in itself turn the negative bearish sentiment away, we expect a positive earnings season for Big Tech which we view as a sneak preview for a major rebound in growth across the tech sector in 2024 with a soft landing backdrop,"" Wedbush added.

Wedbush is not alone in talking up the promise of AI. JPMorgan believes the AI hype is real and it’s here to stay.

“They’ve come off the boil since July, but there’s still a lot of optimism regarding AI’s impact on growth, profits and productivity,” {{0|JPMorgan said in its published outlook on Sept. 26, referring to the recent weakness in AI-related stocks."
2022-09-27, IANS,Explained: This is how Google earthquake alert system will work in India,https://in.investing.com/news/explained-this-is-how-google-earthquake-alert-system-will-work-in-india-3826698,"New Delhi, Sep 27 (IANS) One of the most frequent natural disasters are earthquakes, which is why having an early warning system can be vital in ensuring people's safety, and to address this issue, Google (NASDAQ: ) has introduced an ""Android Earthquake Alert System"" in India to provide users with an early warning when earthquake shaking begins. The alert system will use sensors in Android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes and warn users if such an event occurs.

Android has two types of notifications designed to alert users about an earthquake -- Be Aware Alert and Take Action Alert. Both alert types will only sent for earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 or above.

'Be Aware Alert' is designed to give you a heads-up for light shaking and provide more information when you tap on the notification.

This alert will only be sent to users who will experience MMI (Modified Mercalli Intensity) 3 & 4 shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or above.

MMI is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the intensity of shaking produced by an earthquake. Be Aware Alert will respect the volume, do not disturb and notification settings on your device, meaning it will not break through these settings to alert.

'Take Action Alert' is designed to get your attention before you experience moderate to heavy shaking so that you can take action to protect yourself.

This alert will only be sent to users who will experience MMI 5+ shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater.

Take Action Alert will break through the do not disturb settings, turn on your screen and play a loud sound to alert.

Upon tapping on either alert, you will be presented with earthquake safety information, which consists of simple steps you can take to keep yourself and others safe.

The alert system is also designed to be easy to read and follow and is available in Indian languages supported by Android.

It is rolling out to all Android 5+ users in India during the coming week.

To receive alerts, users must have Wi-Fi and/or cellular data connectivity, and both Android Earthquake Alerts and location settings enabled.

Users who do not wish to receive these alerts can turn off Earthquake Alerts in device settings.

Earthquakes are one of the most common natural disasters in the world, and an early warning can be pivotal in helping people prepare and get themselves and their loved ones to safety.

The system, introduced in consultation with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the National Seismology Center (NSC) in India, uses sensors in android smartphones to detect and estimate earthquakes.

Each android smartphone is equipped with tiny accelerometers that can act as mini seismometers.

When a phone is plugged in and charging, it can detect the very beginnings of earthquakes.

Google sends two types of alerts: Be Aware and Take Action.

The “Be Aware” alerts are sent to users exercising MMI 3 & 4 shaking during an earthquake of magnitude 4.5 or greater.

It just shows an alert on screen and doesn’t play any sound if your phone is on Do Not Disturb mode or in silent mode.

The alerts are sent to users experiencing MMI 5+ shaking during an earthquake of 4.5 magnitude. In this case, the alert will bypass system’s notification settings, including Do No Disturb, and play a loud sound.

“If many phones detect earthquake-like tremors around the same time, our server can use this information to estimate that an earthquake may be happening, as well as characteristics of the event -- like its epicentre and magnitude. Then, our server can send alerts to nearby phones,” Micah Berman, Product Manager, Android Safety at Google, wrote in a blog post.

“Internet signals travel at the speed of light, much faster than the propagation of earthquake shaking through the ground, so the alerts often reach phones several seconds before severe shaking does,” he added.

The feature, already deployed in many countries around the world, will be rolled out to all Android 5+ users in India in the coming week.

The alerts are designed to be easy to read and follow, and are available in Indian languages supported by android.

To receive alerts, users must have Wi-Fi and/or cellular data connectivity, and both android earthquake alerts and location settings enabled.

Users who do not wish to receive these alerts can turn off earthquake alerts in device settings.

The system also provides information through Google Search about local seismic events and safety measures when people search for information with queries like “Earthquake near me.”

2022-09-26, Investing.com,Broadcom Partners with Google Cloud to Strengthen Gen AI-Powered Cybersecurity,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/broadcom-partners-with-google-cloud-to-strengthen-gen-aipowered-cybersecurity-432SI-3824562,"Symantec, a division of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: ), is partnering with Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud to embed generative AI (gen AI) into the Symantec Security platform in a phased rollout that will give customers a significant technical edge for detecting, understanding, and remediating sophisticated cyber attacks.

Symantec is leveraging the Google Cloud Security AI Workbench and security-specific large language model (LLM)--Sec-PaLM 2–across its portfolio to enable natural language interfaces and generate more comprehensive and easy-to-understand threat analyses. With Security AI Workbench-powered summarization of complex incidents and alignment to MITRE ATT&CK context, security operations center (SOC) analysts of all levels can better understand threats and be able to respond faster. That, in turn, translates into greater security and higher SOC productivity.

“Symantec has a long history of designing, implementing, and fine-tuning artificial intelligence and machine learning for critical security use cases and helping our customers drive value out of AI,” said Adam Bromwich, CTO and Head of Engineering, Symantec Enterprise Division, Broadcom. “Our partnership with Google Cloud is part of that continuing journey to put the most innovative security solutions possible into user hands. Our engineers have simplified the process in ways that will enable customers to be much more productive and effective. This is just the beginning of a great collaboration that will help to kickstart the benefits of AI throughout the broader security ecosystem.”

Symantec + Google Cloud: Collaboration Between Industry Leaders

The Symantec and Google Cloud collaboration brings together two of technology’s most accomplished innovators to address a growing cybersecurity talent gap: as the enterprise attack surface expands and becomes more complex, companies struggle to hire security analysts with deep expertise. Symantec’s products will help compensate for this skills shortage, providing less experienced staff with assistive features that summarize threat information in natural language and offer easy ways to operate security products without requiring staffers to learn difficult syntaxes.

Google Cloud has been a key partner in accelerating Broadcom’s growth strategy for several years. Broadcom successfully migrated Symantec Cloud Secure Web Gateway (SWG) and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) onto Google Cloud. Broadcom also modernized the security stack and standardized service delivery processes and offerings on Google Cloud infrastructure, allowing the company to scale and operate more efficiently to better serve enterprise customers.

“Google Cloud and Symantec are working together to deliver AI-infused security that makes threat detection faster and more actionable for all levels of security analysts,” said Sunil Potti, GM and VP of Cloud Security at Google Cloud. “Together, Google Cloud and Symantec are helping to optimize the effectiveness of security controls while removing the manual drudgery that slows implementation, policy tuning, and response times.”

Symantec’s long history and expertise with security-targeted AI and ML, along with Google Cloud’s scale and rich gen AI models, is a powerful combination for customers protecting complex environments. As part of the partnership, Symantec shared query language samples with Google Cloud to help its Sec-PaLM 2 LLM better interact with its specific systems—resulting in improved workflows. Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network provides deep visibility into threats and customers will be able to leverage this telemetry more effectively with advances in gen AI.

“All security vendors will likely embed generative AI into their solutions if they haven’t done so already,” said Frank Dickson, Group Vice President, Security & Trust at IDC. “True innovators will have a deep understanding of how to tap into the predictive models behind generative AI to produce better security data and enable better outcomes. Companies with rich sets of data and expertise in AI/ML are certainly worth keeping an eye on.”

Google Cloud Security AI Workbench to Speed and Enhance Symantec Security Solutions

This initial phase of gen AI adoption requires no updates on products or processes and uses Symantec’s existing externally facing sites. Existing customers can benefit from the enhanced security provided by new features now available for Symantec solutions:

Rapid access to enhanced and descriptive threat descriptions

Easy-to-understand descriptions of the actions performed by malicious scripts and complex machine code (assembly variants - Intel, ARM, etc.)

Increased performance and throughput to identify malicious binary files

Closed loop systems that ensure all output is vetted by a human analyst

YouTube's ‘Premium Lite’ plan, which costs $7.39 per month was first introduced in select European countries in 2021, including Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, and offers ad-free viewing across YouTube's spectrum of apps and formats.

However, it does not include Premium's other features such as offline downloads, background playback, or any YouTube Music benefits, the report said.

Existing ‘Premium Lite’ subscribers will soon be forced to choose between watching YouTube with ads and upgrading to the more expensive YouTube Premium, which includes YouTube Music.

The removal comes only a few weeks after YouTube Premium raised its individual plan prices for the first time, with the plan now starting at $13.99 per month. Meanwhile, family plans increased to $22.99 per month late last year.

Meanwhile, YouTube has announced a new feature for its short-video making platform ‘Shorts’ that will allow users to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) tools to create videos. The feature called -- ‘Dream Screen’, expected to roll out early next year, will allow users to create an AI-generated video or image background just by typing in what they want to see.

2022-09-26, IANS,"P2M transactions driving UPI growth in India, average ticket size drops",https://in.investing.com/news/p2m-transactions-driving-upi-growth-in-india-average-ticket-size-drops-3823956,"New Delhi, Sep 26 (IANS) The unified payments interface (UPI)-based transactions reached 9.3 billion in June 2022 from 151 million in January 2018, primarily driven by the growth in Person-to-Merchant (P2M) transactions, a report showed on Tuesday.In January 2022, P2M transactions accounted for 40.3 per cent of all UPI transactions, compared to 57.5 per cent in June this year and this percentage is likely expected to keep growing, according to Worldline’s ‘India Digital Payments Report for H1 2022’.

The average ticket size for UPI P2M transactions which was Rs 885 in January 2022 has reduced to Rs 653 in June this year, indicating that UPI is now being increasingly used for micro transactions, indicating a further entrenchment of UPI.

“The broad swathes of the country, rural and urban, are embracing digital payments. The allure of digital payments beckons both consumers and merchants alike, evolving it into an indispensable facet,” said Ramesh Narasimhan, CEO-India, Worldline.

Three UPI apps are dominant in terms of volume and value; PhonePe, Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, and Paytm (NS: ).

In terms of transaction volume, in June 2022, thethree apps accounted for 95.68 per cent of all transactions compared to 94.55 per cent a year before.

A key driver for this growth has been the near-ubiquitous acceptance of UPI for both personal and payment transactions from the user/buyer standpoint as well as a high acceptance by merchants.

Also, there has been greater penetration of UPI in rural India, said the report.

In H1 2022, frequently visited in-store merchant categories such as grocery stores, restaurants, service stations, clothing stores, government services, pharmacies and hospitals accounted for around 65 per cent in terms of volume and nearly 50 per cent of the total transaction value.

Mobile payments, which are transactions done using mobile phone apps, have seen solid growth.

The number of mobile transactions in the first half of 2022 was 52.15 billion compared to 33.55 billion in the first half last year.

Another comparison shows the real growth; between January 2022 and June 2022, the volume was up 77 per cent while the value was up 58 per cent, said the report.

The investment is seen as a strategic move by the tech giant to maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving AI sector, particularly against rivals Microsoft (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ).

As part of the deal, Amazon's cloud customers will gain early access to Anthropic's technology via Amazon Bedrock, the company's AI platform for businesses. Furthermore, Anthropic committed to primarily relying on Amazon's cloud services, including training its future AI models on large quantities of proprietary chips purchased from Amazon.

The immediate investment by Amazon will be $1.25 billion, with the option for either party to trigger an additional $2.75 billion in funding from Amazon. Despite the substantial investment, Amazon confirmed it would not gain a board seat and that its stake amounted to a minority position.

Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former OpenAI employees Dario and Daniela Amodei, recently launched its AI assistant named Claude. This product is viewed as a direct competitor to ChatGPT, a creation of OpenAI.

This move mirrors similar strategies adopted by other tech giants. Since 2019, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into its partnership with OpenAI, giving its customers special access to the startup's prose-writing, image-generating technology. Google also invested in Anthropic's $450-million fundraise in May and maintains an ongoing relationship with the startup.

Amazon's investment could potentially boost demand for chips powering AI. Anthropic agreed to work on developing technology for Amazon's in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips.

The deal represents perhaps Amazon's most significant response yet to challenges from smaller cloud rivals that have marketed or developed powerful AI this year. It also indicates ongoing maneuvering by cloud companies to secure ties with AI startups reshaping their industry.

Adam Selipsky, Amazon Web Services's CEO, said the partnership with Anthropic will allow Amazon's employees and cloud customers to infuse their businesses with cutting-edge technology.

The rapid growth of the AI industry is unmistakable, and Amazon's hefty investment in Anthropic underscores its resolve not to be left behind by competitors like Microsoft. This move represents another step in Amazon's continuous expansion into the increasingly competitive AI sector.

""You can display Gmail on your browser in Basic HTML view until January 2024. After this date, Gmail automatically changes to Standard view,"" Google said.

The new cable path will add international route diversity and support the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure for the continents and countries involved, Google said in a statement.

Nuvem will be the first to connect Bermuda with Europe.

""Bermuda has long been committed to the submarine cable market, and we welcome the Nuvem cable to our fast-growing digital Atlantic hub,"" said Walter Roban, Bermuda Deputy Premier and Minister of Home Affairs.

Portugal has similarly become a port for subsea cables not only because of its strategic geographic location on the southwest of mainland Europe, but also because of the country’s focus on bolstering the infrastructure of the digital economy.

“Google's investment incorporates our vision for Portugal in the telecom and data sectors: to establish our country as a thriving connectivity gateway for Europe, fostering robust connections with other continents,” said Joao Galamba, Portugal Minister of Infrastructure.

On the US end, Nuvem will land in South Carolina. The cable’s arrival will further establish the state as a growing technology center, increasing connectivity and job diversification, Google said.

Nuvem will follow in the footsteps of Firmina, which landed in South Carolina earlier this year and that will ultimately connect with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.

Expected to be ready for service in 2026, Nuvem will add capacity, increase reliability, and decrease latency for Google users and Google Cloud customers around the world.

The company has raised nearly $500 million to date, with approximately $300 million coming in since early 2022.

According to the report, the company is hoping to avoid a cash crunch. Since June, it has failed to pay staff salaries on time and has also failed to pay vendor bills.

There have also been layoffs and a business restructuring.

If the new round closes this week, the company will be able to pay employees and, to some extent, streamline cash flow and operations, the report said.

Earlier this month, Dunzo further delayed the salaries of its employees for the months of June and July, this time to November, amid an ongoing fund crunch.

The startup may also vacate its office in Bengaluru to cut costs, according to its co-founder and CEO, Kabeer Biswas.

Biswas reportedly told employees that their pending payouts for June and July will now be cleared in November.

Dunzo earlier delayed salaries to the first week of October after being unable to raise funds.

It had also promised employees to pay an interest of 12 per cent per annum on the salary component that it held back from June.

According to The Verge, Google last year launched a ""Get the Message"" campaign to put pressure on Apple to support RCS on the iPhone, which is still ongoing today with ""iPager"".

""iPager isn’t real, but the problems that Apple causes by using SMS are,"" said Google in the video description on YouTube.

""Let’s make texting better for everyone and help Apple #GetTheMessage and upgrade to RCS,"" it added.

RCS enhances messaging by providing end-to-end encryption, read receipts, and the ability to share high-resolution photos and videos.

iMessage provides similar features, but only for messages sent between other iMessage users, making Android users appear as green message bubble nuisances in group messages -- a real issue in countries like the US, where more than half of the population owns an iPhone, the report said.

Google ended the video with a link to Android.com/GetTheMessage and the new animated mascot.

The campaign has been underway for one year, and iOS 17 just became available as a new update to Apple's operating system. However, there’s no support for RCS there.

The new cable path will add international route diversity and support the development of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure for the continents and countries involved, Google said in a statement.

Nuvem will be the first to connect Bermuda with Europe.

""Bermuda has long been committed to the submarine cable market, and we welcome the Nuvem cable to our fast-growing digital Atlantic hub,"" said Walter Roban, Bermuda Deputy Premier and Minister of Home Affairs.

Portugal has similarly become a port for subsea cables not only because of its strategic geographic location on the southwest of mainland Europe, but also because of the country’s focus on bolstering the infrastructure of the digital economy.

“Google's investment incorporates our vision for Portugal in the telecom and data sectors: to establish our country as a thriving connectivity gateway for Europe, fostering robust connections with other continents,” said Joao Galamba, Portugal Minister of Infrastructure.

On the US end, Nuvem will land in South Carolina. The cable’s arrival will further establish the state as a growing technology center, increasing connectivity and job diversification, Google said.

Nuvem will follow in the footsteps of Firmina, which landed in South Carolina earlier this year and that will ultimately connect with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.

Expected to be ready for service in 2026, Nuvem will add capacity, increase reliability, and decrease latency for Google users and Google Cloud customers around the world.

The company has raised nearly $500 million to date, with approximately $300 million coming in since early 2022.

According to the report, the company is hoping to avoid a cash crunch. Since June, it has failed to pay staff salaries on time and has also failed to pay vendor bills.

There have also been layoffs and a business restructuring.

If the new round closes this week, the company will be able to pay employees and, to some extent, streamline cash flow and operations, the report said.

Earlier this month, Dunzo further delayed the salaries of its employees for the months of June and July, this time to November, amid an ongoing fund crunch.

The startup may also vacate its office in Bengaluru to cut costs, according to its co-founder and CEO, Kabeer Biswas.

Biswas reportedly told employees that their pending payouts for June and July will now be cleared in November.

Dunzo earlier delayed salaries to the first week of October after being unable to raise funds.

It had also promised employees to pay an interest of 12 per cent per annum on the salary component that it held back from June.

According to The Verge, Google last year launched a ""Get the Message"" campaign to put pressure on Apple to support RCS on the iPhone, which is still ongoing today with ""iPager"".

""iPager isn’t real, but the problems that Apple causes by using SMS are,"" said Google in the video description on YouTube.

""Let’s make texting better for everyone and help Apple #GetTheMessage and upgrade to RCS,"" it added.

RCS enhances messaging by providing end-to-end encryption, read receipts, and the ability to share high-resolution photos and videos.

iMessage provides similar features, but only for messages sent between other iMessage users, making Android users appear as green message bubble nuisances in group messages -- a real issue in countries like the US, where more than half of the population owns an iPhone, the report said.

Google ended the video with a link to Android.com/GetTheMessage and the new animated mascot.

The campaign has been underway for one year, and iOS 17 just became available as a new update to Apple's operating system. However, there’s no support for RCS there.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Oracle reasserts $65 billion revenue forecast for 2026 despite recent setbacks,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-reasserts-65-billion-revenue-forecast-for-2026-despite-recent-setbacks-93CH-3819242,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ). has reaffirmed its yearly revenue projection of $65 billion by the fiscal year 2026, a forecast initially shared with investors a year ago. This reassertion comes despite recent quarterly results that left some investors disappointed. Oracle's Executive Vice President, Doug Kehring, restated these projections at the company's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday. He expressed confidence in reaching the stated revenue goal, maintaining a 45% operating margin by fiscal 2026, and achieving an over 10% annual increase in earnings per share.

The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its cloud-computing rental business, an area where it has historically lagged behind competitors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.’s Google. However, investor optimism has been growing as Oracle's cloud services are believed to have the potential to grow rapidly and meet the high-demand computing needs of artificial intelligence products.

Kehring emphasized that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which generated $5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending May 2022, is targeting Google. However, this revenue represented only about 10% of Oracle's total income.

Investor enthusiasm was dampened last week when Oracle reported a 30% increase in cloud sales for the quarter, compared to a 54% surge in the previous period. This announcement led to a nearly 14% drop in Oracle's shares, marking the largest single-day decline in over two decades and pulling them down from an all-time peak.

Ahead of Thursday's event, many analysts anticipated that Oracle would maintain its outlook. To reach its target, the company needs to sustain an average annual sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the next three fiscal years.

However, given the recent slowdown in Oracle's electronic health records division Cerner (NASDAQ: ), which it acquired last year, and the ongoing shift to cloud services, some analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana, believe this to be a challenging endeavor.

On Thursday, Oracle's shares fell by 2.8% to $109.65 at 3:13 p.m. in New York. Despite last week's drop, the stock had risen by 38% this year through Wednesday's close.

In a lawsuit filed against Google's parent company Alphabet this week, Paxson's wife Alicia alleged that “Google Maps directed him to cross the Snow Creek Bridge” as he drove through an “unfamiliar neighbourhood heading home from his daughter's ninth birthday party”.

The Navy veteran’s body was found by state troopers “in an upside down and partially submerged truck”.

Paxson drove off an unguarded edge crashing 20 feet below, read the court filing states.

There were no warning signs or barriers present along the roadway.

""Our girls ask how and why their daddy died, and I'm at a loss for words they can understand because, as an adult, I still can't understand how those responsible for the GPS directions and the bridge could have acted with so little regard for human life,"" Alicia was quoted as saying.

In the years leading up to Paxson's death, “Google Maps had been notified several times by people urging Google to update its route information,” according to the lawsuit.

A Google spokesperson was quoted as saying that the company has the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family.

“Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps and we are reviewing this lawsuit,” the spokesperson added.

This surge, primarily driven by corporate recruitment from companies such as Google (NASDAQ: ), has seen apartment prices in central Zurich soar to nearly unprecedented levels.

As of Thursday, current listings price properties at over €18,000 ($19,000) per square meter. This figure is more than double that of London's housing market, demonstrating how local supply constraints can neutralize the impact of increased interest rates. The intense demand for housing in Zurich has made it one of the most buoyant markets in Europe.

This robust growth in the Zurich housing market can be attributed to a combination of favorable tax breaks and low interest rates. These factors have positioned Zurich as one of the most attractive housing markets across Europe. The city's rise in housing prices underscores the influence of corporate recruitment on local real estate markets.

The upward trend in Zurich's housing market is a clear indication of how potent mixes of economic factors such as low interest rates and favorable tax breaks can stimulate growth. As corporations continue to recruit heavily in Zurich, it remains to be seen how the city's housing market will evolve in response to these dynamics.

Called an Augmented Reality Microscope, or ARM, has shown promise and could prove to be a useful tool for pathologists without easy access to a second opinion, CNBC reported.

The device has a large eyepiece and a tray for examining traditional glass slides, and is also connected to a boxy computer tower that houses the AI models.

The AI detects cancer from the glass slide under the microscope. It also outlines -- a bright green line -- with which doctors can see where exactly the cancer is located.

To indicate how bad the cancer is, the AI generates a black and white heat map on the monitor that shows the boundary of the cancer in a pixelated form.

The ARM is meant to serve as a second line of defence for pathologists, and it would not replace the doctors themselves, Dr. Niels Olson, the chief medical officer of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) at the Department of Defense, was quoted as saying.

He added that the obvious initial use case for the microscope would be in smaller, remote labs, and it could also serve as a resource for pathology residents in training.

According to Aashima Gupta, global director of healthcare strategy and solutions at Google Cloud, the company has launched four algorithms for the ARM which can identify breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer and mitosis.

The AI models are trained on data from the DIU, and Gupta said neither Google employees nor Google infrastructure have access to it, the report said.

The DIU is hoping to make the ARM available to all government users through the General Services Administration website sometime this fall.

The tool is called an Augmented Reality Microscope, and it will usually cost health systems between $90,000 to $100,000, the report said.

“Their contributions have made a real difference in people's lives worldwide. We're excited to announce that we're opening access to more contributors so that we can continue to improve our maps,” the tech giant said in a statement.

Road Mapper is an invite-only platform where people participate in challenges, drawing roads missing from Google Maps. They draw road geometry using satellite images.

“There are still many challenges to complete, but we're confident that with your help, we can make Google Maps the best it can be,” the company added.

If you choose to use the Workspace extensions, your content from Gmail, Docs and Drive is not seen by human reviewers, used by Bard to show you ads or used to train the Bard model.

“You’re always in control of your privacy settings when deciding how you want to use these extensions, and you can turn them off at any time,” said the company.

With responses in English, you can use Bard’s “Google it” button to more easily double-check its answers -- an improvement that taps into work by Google Research and Google DeepMind.

When you click on the “G” icon, Bard will read the response and evaluate whether there is content across the web to substantiate it.

When a statement can be evaluated, you can click the highlighted phrases and learn more about supporting or contradicting information found by Search.

“We’re also making it easier to build on others’ conversations with Bard.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Oracle reasserts $65 billion revenue forecast for 2026 despite recent setbacks,https://in.investing.com/news/oracle-reasserts-65-billion-revenue-forecast-for-2026-despite-recent-setbacks-93CH-3819242,"Oracle Corp (NYSE: ). has reaffirmed its yearly revenue projection of $65 billion by the fiscal year 2026, a forecast initially shared with investors a year ago. This reassertion comes despite recent quarterly results that left some investors disappointed. Oracle's Executive Vice President, Doug Kehring, restated these projections at the company's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday. He expressed confidence in reaching the stated revenue goal, maintaining a 45% operating margin by fiscal 2026, and achieving an over 10% annual increase in earnings per share.

The company's strategic focus remains on expanding its cloud-computing rental business, an area where it has historically lagged behind competitors like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.’s Google. However, investor optimism has been growing as Oracle's cloud services are believed to have the potential to grow rapidly and meet the high-demand computing needs of artificial intelligence products.

Kehring emphasized that Oracle's cloud infrastructure business, which generated $5 billion in revenue in the fiscal year ending May 2022, is targeting Google. However, this revenue represented only about 10% of Oracle's total income.

Investor enthusiasm was dampened last week when Oracle reported a 30% increase in cloud sales for the quarter, compared to a 54% surge in the previous period. This announcement led to a nearly 14% drop in Oracle's shares, marking the largest single-day decline in over two decades and pulling them down from an all-time peak.

Ahead of Thursday's event, many analysts anticipated that Oracle would maintain its outlook. To reach its target, the company needs to sustain an average annual sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the next three fiscal years.

However, given the recent slowdown in Oracle's electronic health records division Cerner (NASDAQ: ), which it acquired last year, and the ongoing shift to cloud services, some analysts, including Bloomberg Intelligence's Anurag Rana, believe this to be a challenging endeavor.

On Thursday, Oracle's shares fell by 2.8% to $109.65 at 3:13 p.m. in New York. Despite last week's drop, the stock had risen by 38% this year through Wednesday's close.

In a lawsuit filed against Google's parent company Alphabet this week, Paxson's wife Alicia alleged that “Google Maps directed him to cross the Snow Creek Bridge” as he drove through an “unfamiliar neighbourhood heading home from his daughter's ninth birthday party”.

The Navy veteran’s body was found by state troopers “in an upside down and partially submerged truck”.

Paxson drove off an unguarded edge crashing 20 feet below, read the court filing states.

There were no warning signs or barriers present along the roadway.

""Our girls ask how and why their daddy died, and I'm at a loss for words they can understand because, as an adult, I still can't understand how those responsible for the GPS directions and the bridge could have acted with so little regard for human life,"" Alicia was quoted as saying.

In the years leading up to Paxson's death, “Google Maps had been notified several times by people urging Google to update its route information,” according to the lawsuit.

A Google spokesperson was quoted as saying that the company has the deepest sympathies for the Paxson family.

“Our goal is to provide accurate routing information in Maps and we are reviewing this lawsuit,” the spokesperson added.

This surge, primarily driven by corporate recruitment from companies such as Google (NASDAQ: ), has seen apartment prices in central Zurich soar to nearly unprecedented levels.

As of Thursday, current listings price properties at over €18,000 ($19,000) per square meter. This figure is more than double that of London's housing market, demonstrating how local supply constraints can neutralize the impact of increased interest rates. The intense demand for housing in Zurich has made it one of the most buoyant markets in Europe.

This robust growth in the Zurich housing market can be attributed to a combination of favorable tax breaks and low interest rates. These factors have positioned Zurich as one of the most attractive housing markets across Europe. The city's rise in housing prices underscores the influence of corporate recruitment on local real estate markets.

The upward trend in Zurich's housing market is a clear indication of how potent mixes of economic factors such as low interest rates and favorable tax breaks can stimulate growth. As corporations continue to recruit heavily in Zurich, it remains to be seen how the city's housing market will evolve in response to these dynamics.

The Federal Reserve kept rates steady on Wednesday, and kept its forecast for one more rate hike this year, but signaled a higher-for-longer rate regime by reining in the number of rate cuts for next year.

""The bottom-line is that the Fed is embracing the 'higher for longer' approach to getting inflation down to target,"" Jefferies said in a note.

Called an Augmented Reality Microscope, or ARM, has shown promise and could prove to be a useful tool for pathologists without easy access to a second opinion, CNBC reported.

The device has a large eyepiece and a tray for examining traditional glass slides, and is also connected to a boxy computer tower that houses the AI models.

The AI detects cancer from the glass slide under the microscope. It also outlines -- a bright green line -- with which doctors can see where exactly the cancer is located.

To indicate how bad the cancer is, the AI generates a black and white heat map on the monitor that shows the boundary of the cancer in a pixelated form.

The ARM is meant to serve as a second line of defence for pathologists, and it would not replace the doctors themselves, Dr. Niels Olson, the chief medical officer of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) at the Department of Defense, was quoted as saying.

He added that the obvious initial use case for the microscope would be in smaller, remote labs, and it could also serve as a resource for pathology residents in training.

According to Aashima Gupta, global director of healthcare strategy and solutions at Google Cloud, the company has launched four algorithms for the ARM which can identify breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer and mitosis.

The AI models are trained on data from the DIU, and Gupta said neither Google employees nor Google infrastructure have access to it, the report said.

The DIU is hoping to make the ARM available to all government users through the General Services Administration website sometime this fall.

The tool is called an Augmented Reality Microscope, and it will usually cost health systems between $90,000 to $100,000, the report said.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

Tesla created Dojo, a dedicated supercomputer, to enhance and train its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. Tesla's vehicles are equipped with numerous sensors and must make critical real-time decisions in unpredictable driving conditions.

“While it is difficult to explicitly validate the many claims Tesla has made about Dojo's cost and performance, we believe Tesla has a chance of bringing forth a competitive customized solution given the company's innovation track record and capabilities,” Morgan Stanley further noted.

Year to date, Tesla shares are up over 150% to $274.39.

These companies have expressed interest in ARM shares, highlighting the excitement surrounding the IPO. These tech giants have also played a significant role in the market recovery witnessed in 2022.

In September, Arm extended its long-term agreement with Apple that is set to last beyond 2040. This deal marks the continuation of their longstanding partnership. Apple remains a major user of Arm architecture across its wide range of products including iPhones, iPads, and Macs.

A recent SEC filing revealed that more than 260 companies reported using Arm-based chips in the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2022. This extensive list includes NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ).

Arm Holdings has also been working with NVIDIA to develop technology to handle AI workloads.

In it, a support representative stated that Google ""doesn’t have any repair centres or service centres"" for the device.

""At this moment, we don’t have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options,"" Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey was quoted as saying.

Starkey also pointed to Google’s hardware warranty policy, which states, ""this Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by -- (1) normal wear and tear; (2) accidents; (3) misuse (including failure to follow product documentation); (4) neglect; (5) disassembly; (6) alterations; (7) servicing other than by Google-authorised technicians; and (8) external causes such as, but not limited to: liquid damage, exposure to sharp objects, exposure to excessive force, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the Google product, and extreme thermal or environmental conditions.""

According to the report, this kind of warranty means leaving owners on their own to deal with damage caused by drops or accidental strikes, and as per Google’s Store, there is no option for an extended warranty to go with a Pixel Watch.

If users' Pixel Watch is accidentally damaged, then they are on their own.

Meanwhile, California passed a right-to-repair law requiring companies to offer replacement parts for electronics priced $50 and higher for three years, and for $100 and higher for seven years.

2022-09-15, IANS,Google pays $93 mn as settlement over deceptive location data practices,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pays-93-mn-as-settlement-over-deceptive-location-data-practices-3810544,"San Francisco, Sep 15 (IANS) California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced a $93 million settlement with Google (NASDAQ: ) over its deceptive and misleading options for managing location data.The settlement resolved allegations as part of the lawsuit that Google’s location-privacy practices violated California consumer protection laws.

The settlement follows a multi-year investigation by the California Department of Justice that determined Google was deceiving users by collecting, storing, and using their location data for consumer profiling and advertising purposes without informed consent.

In addition to paying $93 million, Google has agreed to accept strong injunctive terms to deter future misconduct, Bonta said in a statement late on Thursday.

“Our investigation revealed that Google was telling its users one thing -- that it would no longer track their location once they opted out -- but doing the opposite and continuing to track its users’ movements for its own commercial gain,” said Bonta.

Google generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, and location-based advertising (or geo-targeted advertising) is a critical feature of Google’s advertising platform because advertisers want the ability to market to users based on their geographical locations.

Google also uses their location data to build behavioural profiles of users to help determine which ads to serve users, said the Attorney General.

Bonta alleged that Google deceived users in numerous ways regarding how it collected, stored, and used a person’s location data.

For example, the complaint alleged that Google falsely told users that if they turned off the “Location History” setting, then Google would not store their location data.

However, according to the complaint, even when a user turned Location History off, Google continued to collect and store that user’s location data through other sources.

Under the settlement, Google must pay the state $93 million and be subject to a number of injunctive terms that will protect the privacy interests of California users.

Nguonly said that he lost Rs 67 lakh (about $80,000) in crypto between November 2021 and June 2022, including losses of Rs 24 lakh ($30,000) of his original investment and an estimated Rs 41 lakh ($50,000) in unrealised gains.

He was up about Rs 42 lakh ($50,000) for a while as the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high. However, by the end of 2021, the crypto market had plummeted, and by the summer of 2022, Bitcoin's price had dropped by more than 70 per cent, the report mentioned.

""I was investing with some money that I didn’t necessarily have. Once the crypto market kind of reversed, my losses were amplified,"" Nguonly was quoted as saying.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Softbank's Arm Holdings

Chip design unit Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) saw a heavily oversubscribed IPO in US markets Thursday, with its valuation also racing past initial projections.

Shares of Arm, a unit of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank (TYO: ) (OTC: ), surged some 25% to $63.59 on their first day of trade in the US, making for about a $65 billion market cap - far higher than the $54B valuation projected in the offering.

Gains spilled over into Softbank's Tokyo shares Friday, which closed the session up 2.1% to 6,718 yen. In New York, Softbank ADRs ticked 0.9% higher on Thursday before retreating 2.4% on Friday. Softbank retains 90% ownership of the company.

The Arm debut is the year's biggest, and saw many of the chip designer’s biggest clients participating as cornerstone investors. Apple (NASDAQ: , Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) were among the biggest investors in the firm.

Arm’s listing marks the close of a long-running attempt by Softbank to cash out on the chip designer. The conglomerate had agreed to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40B in 2021, although the plan was scuttled due to regulatory hurdles.

Demand for Arm’s IPO was also largely underpinned by growing optimism over an AI boom this year, which chipmakers such as Nvidia predict will fuel a major bump in chip demand over the coming years.

Apple iPhones titanium

Apple (NASDAQ: ) launched its iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models last Tuesday, as well as the higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.

Apple also unveiled new Apple Watch constructed with 95% titanium and boasting 72 hours of battery life.

The Pro Max - the most expensive of the new iPhones - went on sale for pre-orders on Friday, and initial delivery times for the model slipped into October, according to Bloomberg, suggesting strong demand.

The potentially strong demand is a positive for investors, with concerns emerging in recent weeks regarding overall iPhone demand, particularly regarding the consumer appetite for Apple iPhones in China following the launch of Huawei's new smartphone.

Following the event, Morgan Stanley noted that China risk ""continues to dominate investor conversations,"" but added, ""We still believe there is upside to FY24 expectations.”

Goldman Sachs, for its part, said:

“Although the product announcements and key features were largely as expected, price increases on iPhone were lower-than-expected… We're encouraged by Apple's continued investments into the Apple ecosystem and US carrier promotions for the iPhone continue to be supportive of demand.”

Shares of Apple slipped 2.9% for the week to $175.01.

Qualcomm signs with Apple

A day earlier, and in other Apple-related news, Qualcomm Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) said that it had secured an agreement to provide its high-end chips for Apple iPhones to be launched from 2024 through 2026

Shares in the chipmaker jumped nearly 4% on the announcement.

After the announcement, Deutsche Bank maintained its a Hold rating and $120.00 price target on Qualcomm, noting that the development is ""clearly a positive for QCOM, with eventual AAPL loss now not expected until 2026 at the earliest (vs. prior expectations of 2024).""

The analysts said the estimate the total associated opportunity to come to some $9B a year.

""Overall, this announcement highlights the true value QCOM’s superior technology, and we agree the stock should rise in response,"" said Deutsche, while adding that they are reiterating the Hold rating in part due to ""ongoing pressures in the total smartphone market and the potential for only incremental opex improvements now that AAPL biz must be maintained.""

Shares ended 1.7% higher for the week.





Oracle revenue

Oracle (NYSE: ) shares plunged more than 13% on Tuesday after management offered a weak outlook for the second quarter on its fiscal first-quarter earnings call.

Q1 results beat analysts' forecasts, reporting earnings per share of $1.19 vs. the expected $1.15 and $12.45B in sales, given boosted demand for cloud services amid an ongoing push to develop generative AI apps.

But on the call, Oracle said it sees total revenue growing 5% to 7% at today's currency rates and 3% to 5% in constant currency. Cloud revenue is seen growing at 28% in constant currency, below the 29% reported for Q1. Oracle attributed the soft cloud outlook to the accelerated transition of its Cerner (NASDAQ: ) unit to the cloud.

Adjusted EPS is seen at $1.29 (up or down 2 cents), above the $1.25 consensus.

We reiterate ORCL as Buy rated and our Best Idea.""

Shares ended the week at $113.91, down more than 10% for the five sessions.

Tesla upgraded

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) soared 10% Monday on word of an upgrade to Overweight from Morgan Stanley, whose analysts said the stock can surge thanks to its Dojo Supercomputer.

Tesla stock is also a new Top Pick at Morgan Stanley with a price target of $400 per share, a new Street high.

The analysts wrote in a new to clients that the company's ""advanced supercomputing architecture... pushes new boundaries in custom silicon and may put Tesla at an asymmetric advantage in a $10trn TAM.""

The analysts liken Tesla to Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the e-commerce titan’s AWS was able to reach 70% of the company’s total earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), and says Dojo can add up to $500B to Tesla's enterprise value.

In it, a support representative stated that Google ""doesn’t have any repair centres or service centres"" for the device.

""At this moment, we don’t have any repair option for the Google Pixel Watch. If your watch is damaged, you can contact the Google Pixel Watch Customer Support Team to check your replacement options,"" Google spokesperson Bridget Starkey was quoted as saying.

Starkey also pointed to Google’s hardware warranty policy, which states, ""this Limited Warranty does not apply to damage caused by -- (1) normal wear and tear; (2) accidents; (3) misuse (including failure to follow product documentation); (4) neglect; (5) disassembly; (6) alterations; (7) servicing other than by Google-authorised technicians; and (8) external causes such as, but not limited to: liquid damage, exposure to sharp objects, exposure to excessive force, anomalies in the electrical current supplied to the Google product, and extreme thermal or environmental conditions.""

According to the report, this kind of warranty means leaving owners on their own to deal with damage caused by drops or accidental strikes, and as per Google’s Store, there is no option for an extended warranty to go with a Pixel Watch.

If users' Pixel Watch is accidentally damaged, then they are on their own.

Meanwhile, California passed a right-to-repair law requiring companies to offer replacement parts for electronics priced $50 and higher for three years, and for $100 and higher for seven years.

2022-09-15, IANS,Google pays $93 mn as settlement over deceptive location data practices,https://in.investing.com/news/google-pays-93-mn-as-settlement-over-deceptive-location-data-practices-3810544,"San Francisco, Sep 15 (IANS) California Attorney General Rob Bonta has announced a $93 million settlement with Google (NASDAQ: ) over its deceptive and misleading options for managing location data.The settlement resolved allegations as part of the lawsuit that Google’s location-privacy practices violated California consumer protection laws.

The settlement follows a multi-year investigation by the California Department of Justice that determined Google was deceiving users by collecting, storing, and using their location data for consumer profiling and advertising purposes without informed consent.

In addition to paying $93 million, Google has agreed to accept strong injunctive terms to deter future misconduct, Bonta said in a statement late on Thursday.

“Our investigation revealed that Google was telling its users one thing -- that it would no longer track their location once they opted out -- but doing the opposite and continuing to track its users’ movements for its own commercial gain,” said Bonta.

Google generates the majority of its revenue from advertising, and location-based advertising (or geo-targeted advertising) is a critical feature of Google’s advertising platform because advertisers want the ability to market to users based on their geographical locations.

Google also uses their location data to build behavioural profiles of users to help determine which ads to serve users, said the Attorney General.

Bonta alleged that Google deceived users in numerous ways regarding how it collected, stored, and used a person’s location data.

For example, the complaint alleged that Google falsely told users that if they turned off the “Location History” setting, then Google would not store their location data.

However, according to the complaint, even when a user turned Location History off, Google continued to collect and store that user’s location data through other sources.

Under the settlement, Google must pay the state $93 million and be subject to a number of injunctive terms that will protect the privacy interests of California users.

During the event, the company introduced a unified metadata layer within the rebranded Data Cloud and revamped the Commerce and Marketing Clouds to achieve a more cohesive integration on the platform. Additionally, they unveiled a new ""freemium"" model, offering Enterprise or Unlimited customers on Sales or Service Cloud 10,000 Data Cloud profiles and 2 Tableau creator licenses at no cost.

2022-09-14, AMBCrypto,Crypto worth $15 mln at risk amidst phishing attack on software provider,https://in.investing.com/news/crypto-worth-15-mln-at-risk-amidst-phishing-attack-on-software-provider-3809675,"The attacker altered user emails and reset passwords on Retool, affecting 27 accounts.

However, Retool’s on-premise customers remained unaffected by the attack.

Retool, a prominent software platform, fell victim to a spear phishing attack on 27 August, putting cryptocurrency worth $15 million at risk. While it led to unauthorized access for some cloud customers, Retool promptly took action to address the breach.

The attacker exploited an SMS-based phishing attack, targeting Retool employees. By sending fraudulent texts, the attacker posed as a member of the IT team, claiming to address an issue related to payroll systems and open enrollment, thus leveraging a critical point of concern for employees: healthcare coverage.

The timing coincided with the migration of logins to Okta, and the message contained a URL that mimicked Retool’s internal identity portal.

Unmasking deceptive tactics in the attack While most employees refrained from engaging with the text, one unfortunate employee clicked on the link, leading to a fake portal, complete with multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts.

Subsequently, the attacker initiated a phone call with the employee, using a deepfake voice that resembled a Retool IT team member. During the conversation, the employee grew increasingly suspicious, but still shared an additional MFA code.

This additional code allowed the attacker to add their device to the employee’s Okta account. Adding the device granted them access to an active GSuite session.

Notably, Google (NASDAQ: ) had recently introduced a feature that syncs MFA codes to the cloud, potentially compromising security. The attacker capitalized on this vulnerability, enabled by Google’s dark patterns that encouraged MFA code syncing.

The breach’s impact extended to Retool’s internal systems, including VPN and admin systems, enabling an account takeover attack on specific customers, primarily from the crypto industry.

The attacker altered user emails and reset passwords, affecting 27 accounts in total.

Upon discovering the breach, Retool took swift action. It revoked all internal authenticated sessions, securing affected accounts, notifying impacted customers, and restoring their accounts to their original states.

Remarkably, Retool’s on-premise customers remained unaffected, as the on-premises system operates independently of Retool’s cloud environment.

The company confirmed that it was actively collaborating with law enforcement and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the breach."

The search engine giant stated that while it continues to invest in top engineering and technical talent, it intends to slow down its overall hiring efforts. The reduction in the volume of recruiter requests has led to a decision to decrease the size of its recruiting team, the company said.

According to Bank of America analysts, this is a promising sign for Google's profit margins.

“We see the news as positive for Google and a good sign for 2024 margins. A cutback the recruiting team suggests cognizant efforts to contain expenses and 'grow revenues faster than expenses.' We currently expect Google headcount to grow 10% in 2024, with GAAP operating expenses also up 10% y/y to $96bn and recruiting cuts could drive lower headcount growth,” they wrote in a client note.

Google previously eliminated 12,000 jobs in January, which is about 6% of its total workforce."

“That is below the $64 billion Arm owner SoftBank Group recently valued the company at when it bought out a stake held by its Vision Fund,” the report said.

The Japanese investment giant SoftBank acquired Arm for $31 billion in 2016.

Customers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, Intel (NASDAQ: ), AMD, TSMC, and Samsung (KS: ) have all said they will buy ARM shares.

Arm has filed for an IPO listing with , which is touted as the year’s biggest. Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2022.

The company has developed and licensed high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

Arm is a core supplier of architecture technology to most semiconductor companies. Its Arm instruction set is at the core of nearly all mobile processors powering smartphones, including those made by Apple and Android devices that use Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) chips.

Arm is reportedly developing its own chip, aiming to showcase the capabilities of its designs and attract new customers.

The decision comes as part of the tech giant's ongoing strategy to slow hiring.

While a small number of employees will be affected by the layoffs, the majority of the team will remain in place to support crucial hiring needs. Alphabet has also committed to assisting affected employees in finding new roles both within and outside the organization.

Earlier this year, Alphabet, along with other tech giants such as Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), underwent significant downsizing in response to a slowing economy that brought an abrupt end to their pandemic-driven hiring sprees.

In January 2022, Alphabet reduced its workforce by approximately 6%, equating to around 12,000 positions. This move followed a period of rapid growth for the company, which added over 50,000 employees starting in 2021 due to surging demand for its services during the pandemic. However, fears of an economic downturn led advertisers to cut back their spending last year, slowing the growth of Alphabet's core digital ad business.

According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alphabet had 190,234 employees at the end of 2022. By the end of June 2022, this number had dropped to 181,798.

Alphabet's President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat stated in July that the company is focused on reorganizing expenses to make room for investments that yield the highest returns.

The layoffs have sparked reactions from affected employees on LinkedIn, many of whom expressed disappointment at their dream jobs coming to an end. However, they also acknowledged the need for Alphabet Inc. to mitigate losses and keep the business running effectively amidst economic challenges.

Google, however, declined to reveal the exact number of people being asked to go from its recruiting workforce, reports Semafor.

“In order to continue our important work to ensure we operate efficiently, we’ve made the hard decision to reduce the size of our recruiting team,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’re supporting everyone impacted with a transition period, outplacement services, and severance as they look for new opportunities here at Google and beyond,” the spokesperson added.

Google slowed down the pace of hiring last year amid the global economic slowdown.

On January 20 this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed in a letter to employees that about 12,000 people will be laid off globally, accounting for more than 6 per cent of the total workforce.

Google India terminated more than 400 employees.

In March, the tech giant informed its employees via an email that fewer of them will be promoted to more senior levels this year as compared to the past.

In a bid to further cut costs, Google even asked employees who return to work to share their work desks with a ""partner"" to maximise office space, according to earlier reports.

Amid layoffs, Google also created several cost-cutting measures such as cutting down on free snacks and workout classes for its existing employees.

The company also discontinued spending on personal equipment like laptops, according to an internal memo.

2022-09-13, Investing.com,Federal Reserve rate decision eyed as August inflation hits 3.7%,https://in.investing.com/news/federal-reserve-rate-decision-eyed-as-august-inflation-hits-37-93CH-3808481,"On Wednesday, the markets demonstrated optimism following the release of moderate August consumer price inflation data. The figures unveiled a 0.6% monthly increase, in line with expert forecasts, while the yearly rate rose to 3.7%, slightly above expectations. This has led to anticipation that the Federal Reserve may maintain the current interest rates in their upcoming September meeting.

The inflation data was notably influenced by a surge in gasoline prices, which peaked at $3.984 per gallon in the third week of August, up from $3.676 in July. Despite this increase, energy prices are expected to remain range-bound in the near future. Core CPI, excluding volatile elements such as food and energy, saw a modest rise of 0.3%, a figure closely watched by Federal Reserve officials for assessing long-term inflation trajectory.

Wall Street consensus suggests a likely pause in rate hikes during the imminent Federal Reserve session, with the CME FedWatch Tool estimating a 97% chance of rates remaining unchanged. Economist Vincent Reinhart of Dreyfus and Mellon suggested that any action from the Federal Reserve would likely occur in November.

In stock market news, megacap growth equities presented varied results on Wednesday. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) experienced increases of 1.9% and 1.2% respectively, while tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) saw minor declines. Market participants are now awaiting data on August's producer prices and retail sales due for release ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision on September 20.

The overall market sentiment is currently bullish, primarily driven by expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's rate decisions. The performance of key stocks and economic indicators will continue to influence market trends in the coming weeks.

The company's earnings report, released on Monday, fell short of Wall Street's expectations, signaling that the anticipated boost from generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) might take longer to materialize than initially expected.

The company is known for its database software and has been trying to catch up with major cloud providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google Cloud. However, Oracle's cloud sales growth slowed down in Q1, with the company's cloud infrastructure revenue coming in at $1.5 billion, marking a 66% increase but still lower than the previous quarter's 76% growth.

Oracle's CEO Safra Catz also warned of near-term weakness in revenue growth at the Cerner (NASDAQ: ) health records business, which Oracle acquired for $28.3 billion last year. The company is transitioning customers in this unit to the cloud from license purchases that are recognized upfront.

Despite these challenges, Oracle continues to see growth in its infrastructure-as-a-service business, which grew by 66% year-over-year. Oracle's chief technology officer, executive chairman, and co-founder Larry Ellison noted during the company's earnings call that AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation2 Cloud.

However, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria expressed concerns about Oracle's growth prospects stating, “We continue to believe high single-digit growth might be unsustainable for Oracle given Cerner integration risks and formidable data center competition,” as he cut his price target on the stock to $105.

Despite these concerns, most analysts remain positive about Oracle. At least 14 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $133, nearly 5% higher than the company’s last closing price. Barclays (LON: ) analysts attributed the share price decline to Oracle’s rally in the run-up to earnings and highlighted strong deferred revenue, AI backlog commentary and some positive signs in the cloud business as positives.

Oracle currently has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.78, compared with the industry median of 15.42. The company's stock has risen 55% this year on optimism that the rise of generative AI would drive up cloud demand.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Google faces antitrust trial over alleged market rigging,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-antitrust-trial-over-alleged-market-rigging-93CH-3806479,"The second largest antitrust trial in the United States since the Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) case is set to commence today, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at the center of federal regulators' scrutiny. Over the next 10 weeks, federal lawyers and state attorneys are expected to argue that Google has manipulated the market in its favor by making its search engine the default choice on various devices. The outcome of this trial could significantly impact the tech giant's future operations.

The antitrust lawsuit was initiated nearly three years ago during the Trump administration by the Justice Department. The charges allege that Google has misused its internet search dominance to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. Government lawyers claim that Google secures its franchise through a form of payola, spending billions annually to remain the default search engine on devices such as the iPhone and web browsers like Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.

Additionally, regulators accuse Google of illegally skewing the market in its favor by insisting that device manufacturers bundle its search engine with Android software to gain full access to the Android app store. This charge mirrors a similar accusation leveled against Microsoft in 1998 when it was alleged that Microsoft forced computer makers to feature its Internet Explorer browser alongside its dominant Windows operating system.

However, Google refutes these allegations, asserting that despite controlling about 90% of the internet search market, it faces significant competition. The company cites competitors ranging from search engines like Microsoft's Bing to websites such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Yelp (NYSE: ). From Google's perspective, continuous improvements to its search engine are what keep users returning, a habit that has made ""Googling"" synonymous with online searches.

Top executives from Google and its parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, are expected to testify during the trial. Court documents also suggest that high-ranking Apple executive Eddy Cue might be called to testify.

The legal battle could potentially disrupt Google's focus and operations, similar to what happened to Microsoft following its antitrust showdown with the Justice Department. If the trial concludes with concessions that undermine Google's power, the company might be forced to stop paying Apple and other firms to make Google the default search engine on smartphones and computers.

The trial commences shortly after the 25th anniversary of Google's first investment, a $100,000 check from Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim that enabled Larry Page and Sergey Brin to establish their business in a Silicon Valley garage. Today, Alphabet is valued at $1.7 trillion, employs over 182,000 people, and generates most of its revenue from $224 billion in annual ad sales through a network of digital services centered around its search engine.

US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue a ruling early next year. If Google is found guilty of market manipulation, a subsequent trial will be scheduled to determine appropriate measures to rein in the California-based company.

(TPE:2330) (NYSE:TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker, has approved an investment of up to $100 million in Arm Holdings Plc's initial public offering (IPO), as per the company's announcement on Tuesday. TSMC, a major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) among others, manufactures semiconductors that are often based on Arm architecture.

Arm Holdings, a British semiconductor designer owned by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (TYO:TYO: ), is expected to go public later this week in the U.S. The company has priced its shares between $47 and $51, aiming to raise nearly $5 billion and valuing the company at over $50 billion. The IPO has attracted significant interest from major technology companies including Nvidia, Apple, and TSMC, which collectively expressed interest in purchasing up to $735 million worth of shares.

On Monday, Bloomberg reported that the Arm IPO was already oversubscribed by 10 times, suggesting that the order books for shares could close as early as Tuesday, ahead of expectations. The report also indicated that Arm might consider raising the price range for its IPO due to the high demand.

TSMC's approval of the investment signifies its support for Arm's success. As TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said last week, ""Arm is an important element of our ecosystem, our technology and our customers’ ecosystem. We want it to be successful, we want it to be healthy.""

2022-09-12, IANS,Google launches $20 mn fund to support responsible AI,https://in.investing.com/news/google-launches-20-mn-fund-to-support-responsible-ai-3805509,"New Delhi, Sep 12 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has launched the Digital Futures Project, an initiative that aims to bring together a range of voices to promote efforts to understand and address the opportunities and challenges of artificial intelligence (AI).Through this project, the company will support researchers, organise convenings and foster debate on public policy solutions to encourage the responsible development of AI.

“As part of the Project, Google.org is establishing a $20 million fund, which will provide grants to leading think tanks and academic institutions around the world to facilitate dialogue and inquiry into this important technology,” the tech giant said in a blog post late on Monday.

Inaugural grantees of the Digital Futures Fund include the Aspen Institute, Brookings Institution, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Center for a New American Security, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Institute for Security and Technology, Leadership Conference Education Fund, MIT Work of the Future, R Street Institute and SeedAI.

“The fund will support institutions from countries around the globe, and we look forward to sharing more on these organisations soon,” said Google.

In May this year, US Vice President Kamala Harris told top Big Tech CEOs -- including Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (ChatGPT fame) -- that the private sector has an ethical, moral, and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products.

In her meeting with CEOs of four US companies who are at the forefront of AI innovation, which also saw US President Joe Biden dropping by, she stressed that in order to realise the benefits that might come from advances in AI, ""it is imperative to mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security"".

""These include risks to safety, security, human and civil rights, privacy, jobs, and democratic values,"" the White House had said in a statement.

Harris told the CEOs that advances in technology have always presented opportunities and risks, and generative AI is no different.

The White House also announced more funding and policy guidance for developing responsible AI.

During the event, the company introduced a unified metadata layer within the rebranded Data Cloud and revamped the Commerce and Marketing Clouds to achieve a more cohesive integration on the platform. Additionally, they unveiled a new ""freemium"" model, offering Enterprise or Unlimited customers on Sales or Service Cloud 10,000 Data Cloud profiles and 2 Tableau creator licenses at no cost.

BofA analysts came away from the event with confidence in BoA’s position, instilled by the product announcements, which highlighted Salesforce's effective implementation of a strategy aimed at seamlessly incorporating its data and external data sources. This integration is designed to embed essential AI-driven workflows throughout the core front office suite, encompassing functions in sales, service, marketing, and eCommerce applications.

“We believe Salesforce is well positioned to continue capturing share of the cumulative $200 billion market opportunity,” they wrote in a note.

2022-09-14, AMBCrypto,Crypto worth $15 mln at risk amidst phishing attack on software provider,https://in.investing.com/news/crypto-worth-15-mln-at-risk-amidst-phishing-attack-on-software-provider-3809675,"The attacker altered user emails and reset passwords on Retool, affecting 27 accounts.

However, Retool’s on-premise customers remained unaffected by the attack.

Retool, a prominent software platform, fell victim to a spear phishing attack on 27 August, putting cryptocurrency worth $15 million at risk. While it led to unauthorized access for some cloud customers, Retool promptly took action to address the breach.

The attacker exploited an SMS-based phishing attack, targeting Retool employees. By sending fraudulent texts, the attacker posed as a member of the IT team, claiming to address an issue related to payroll systems and open enrollment, thus leveraging a critical point of concern for employees: healthcare coverage.

The timing coincided with the migration of logins to Okta, and the message contained a URL that mimicked Retool’s internal identity portal.

Unmasking deceptive tactics in the attack While most employees refrained from engaging with the text, one unfortunate employee clicked on the link, leading to a fake portal, complete with multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompts.

Subsequently, the attacker initiated a phone call with the employee, using a deepfake voice that resembled a Retool IT team member. During the conversation, the employee grew increasingly suspicious, but still shared an additional MFA code.

This additional code allowed the attacker to add their device to the employee’s Okta account. Adding the device granted them access to an active GSuite session.

Notably, Google (NASDAQ: ) had recently introduced a feature that syncs MFA codes to the cloud, potentially compromising security. The attacker capitalized on this vulnerability, enabled by Google’s dark patterns that encouraged MFA code syncing.

The breach’s impact extended to Retool’s internal systems, including VPN and admin systems, enabling an account takeover attack on specific customers, primarily from the crypto industry.

The attacker altered user emails and reset passwords, affecting 27 accounts in total.

Upon discovering the breach, Retool took swift action. It revoked all internal authenticated sessions, securing affected accounts, notifying impacted customers, and restoring their accounts to their original states.

Remarkably, Retool’s on-premise customers remained unaffected, as the on-premises system operates independently of Retool’s cloud environment.

The company confirmed that it was actively collaborating with law enforcement and a third-party forensics firm to investigate the breach."

The search engine giant stated that while it continues to invest in top engineering and technical talent, it intends to slow down its overall hiring efforts. The reduction in the volume of recruiter requests has led to a decision to decrease the size of its recruiting team, the company said.

According to Bank of America analysts, this is a promising sign for Google's profit margins.

“We see the news as positive for Google and a good sign for 2024 margins. A cutback the recruiting team suggests cognizant efforts to contain expenses and 'grow revenues faster than expenses.' We currently expect Google headcount to grow 10% in 2024, with GAAP operating expenses also up 10% y/y to $96bn and recruiting cuts could drive lower headcount growth,” they wrote in a client note.

Google previously eliminated 12,000 jobs in January, which is about 6% of its total workforce."

“That is below the $64 billion Arm owner SoftBank Group recently valued the company at when it bought out a stake held by its Vision Fund,” the report said.

The Japanese investment giant SoftBank acquired Arm for $31 billion in 2016.

Customers like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia, Intel (NASDAQ: ), AMD, TSMC, and Samsung (KS: ) have all said they will buy ARM shares.

Arm has filed for an IPO listing with , which is touted as the year’s biggest. Analysts expect Arm’s IPO to be the biggest of 2022.

The company has developed and licensed high-performance, low-cost, and energy-efficient central processing unit (CPU) products and related technology.

Arm was supposed to be acquired by graphics chip giant Nvidia for $40 billion in 2020, but the deal was called off in February 2022, owing to “significant regulatory challenges preventing the consummation of the transaction”.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had sued to block Nvidia's $40 billion acquisition of Arm from Softbank on antitrust grounds.

Arm is a core supplier of architecture technology to most semiconductor companies. Its Arm instruction set is at the core of nearly all mobile processors powering smartphones, including those made by Apple and Android devices that use Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) chips.

Arm is reportedly developing its own chip, aiming to showcase the capabilities of its designs and attract new customers.

The decision comes as part of the tech giant's ongoing strategy to slow hiring.

While a small number of employees will be affected by the layoffs, the majority of the team will remain in place to support crucial hiring needs. Alphabet has also committed to assisting affected employees in finding new roles both within and outside the organization.

Earlier this year, Alphabet, along with other tech giants such as Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ), underwent significant downsizing in response to a slowing economy that brought an abrupt end to their pandemic-driven hiring sprees.

In January 2022, Alphabet reduced its workforce by approximately 6%, equating to around 12,000 positions. This move followed a period of rapid growth for the company, which added over 50,000 employees starting in 2021 due to surging demand for its services during the pandemic. However, fears of an economic downturn led advertisers to cut back their spending last year, slowing the growth of Alphabet's core digital ad business.

According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Alphabet had 190,234 employees at the end of 2022. By the end of June 2022, this number had dropped to 181,798.

Alphabet's President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat stated in July that the company is focused on reorganizing expenses to make room for investments that yield the highest returns.

The layoffs have sparked reactions from affected employees on LinkedIn, many of whom expressed disappointment at their dream jobs coming to an end. However, they also acknowledged the need for Alphabet Inc. to mitigate losses and keep the business running effectively amidst economic challenges.

Google, however, declined to reveal the exact number of people being asked to go from its recruiting workforce, reports Semafor.

“In order to continue our important work to ensure we operate efficiently, we’ve made the hard decision to reduce the size of our recruiting team,” a company spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report.

“We’re supporting everyone impacted with a transition period, outplacement services, and severance as they look for new opportunities here at Google and beyond,” the spokesperson added.

Google slowed down the pace of hiring last year amid the global economic slowdown.

On January 20 this year, Google CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed in a letter to employees that about 12,000 people will be laid off globally, accounting for more than 6 per cent of the total workforce.

Google India terminated more than 400 employees.

In March, the tech giant informed its employees via an email that fewer of them will be promoted to more senior levels this year as compared to the past.

In a bid to further cut costs, Google even asked employees who return to work to share their work desks with a ""partner"" to maximise office space, according to earlier reports.

Amid layoffs, Google also created several cost-cutting measures such as cutting down on free snacks and workout classes for its existing employees.

The company also discontinued spending on personal equipment like laptops, according to an internal memo.

2022-09-13, Investing.com,Federal Reserve rate decision eyed as August inflation hits 3.7%,https://in.investing.com/news/federal-reserve-rate-decision-eyed-as-august-inflation-hits-37-93CH-3808481,"On Wednesday, the markets demonstrated optimism following the release of moderate August consumer price inflation data. The figures unveiled a 0.6% monthly increase, in line with expert forecasts, while the yearly rate rose to 3.7%, slightly above expectations. This has led to anticipation that the Federal Reserve may maintain the current interest rates in their upcoming September meeting.

The inflation data was notably influenced by a surge in gasoline prices, which peaked at $3.984 per gallon in the third week of August, up from $3.676 in July. Despite this increase, energy prices are expected to remain range-bound in the near future. Core CPI, excluding volatile elements such as food and energy, saw a modest rise of 0.3%, a figure closely watched by Federal Reserve officials for assessing long-term inflation trajectory.

Wall Street consensus suggests a likely pause in rate hikes during the imminent Federal Reserve session, with the CME FedWatch Tool estimating a 97% chance of rates remaining unchanged. Economist Vincent Reinhart of Dreyfus and Mellon suggested that any action from the Federal Reserve would likely occur in November.

In stock market news, megacap growth equities presented varied results on Wednesday. Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) experienced increases of 1.9% and 1.2% respectively, while tech giants Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) saw minor declines. Market participants are now awaiting data on August's producer prices and retail sales due for release ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy decision on September 20.

The overall market sentiment is currently bullish, primarily driven by expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's rate decisions. The performance of key stocks and economic indicators will continue to influence market trends in the coming weeks.

The company's earnings report, released on Monday, fell short of Wall Street's expectations, signaling that the anticipated boost from generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) might take longer to materialize than initially expected.

The company is known for its database software and has been trying to catch up with major cloud providers such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Web Services, Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google Cloud. However, Oracle's cloud sales growth slowed down in Q1, with the company's cloud infrastructure revenue coming in at $1.5 billion, marking a 66% increase but still lower than the previous quarter's 76% growth.

Oracle's CEO Safra Catz also warned of near-term weakness in revenue growth at the Cerner (NASDAQ: ) health records business, which Oracle acquired for $28.3 billion last year. The company is transitioning customers in this unit to the cloud from license purchases that are recognized upfront.

Despite these challenges, Oracle continues to see growth in its infrastructure-as-a-service business, which grew by 66% year-over-year. Oracle's chief technology officer, executive chairman, and co-founder Larry Ellison noted during the company's earnings call that AI development companies have signed contracts to purchase more than $4 billion of AI training capacity in Oracle's Generation2 Cloud.

However, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria expressed concerns about Oracle's growth prospects stating, “We continue to believe high single-digit growth might be unsustainable for Oracle given Cerner integration risks and formidable data center competition,” as he cut his price target on the stock to $105.

Despite these concerns, most analysts remain positive about Oracle. At least 14 brokerages raised their price targets on the stock, pushing the median view to $133, nearly 5% higher than the company’s last closing price. Barclays (LON: ) analysts attributed the share price decline to Oracle’s rally in the run-up to earnings and highlighted strong deferred revenue, AI backlog commentary and some positive signs in the cloud business as positives.

Oracle currently has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.78, compared with the industry median of 15.42. The company's stock has risen 55% this year on optimism that the rise of generative AI would drive up cloud demand.

2022-09-12, Investing.com,Google faces antitrust trial over alleged market rigging,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-antitrust-trial-over-alleged-market-rigging-93CH-3806479,"The second largest antitrust trial in the United States since the Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) case is set to commence today, with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at the center of federal regulators' scrutiny. Over the next 10 weeks, federal lawyers and state attorneys are expected to argue that Google has manipulated the market in its favor by making its search engine the default choice on various devices. The outcome of this trial could significantly impact the tech giant's future operations.

The antitrust lawsuit was initiated nearly three years ago during the Trump administration by the Justice Department. The charges allege that Google has misused its internet search dominance to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. Government lawyers claim that Google secures its franchise through a form of payola, spending billions annually to remain the default search engine on devices such as the iPhone and web browsers like Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Safari and Mozilla's Firefox.

Additionally, regulators accuse Google of illegally skewing the market in its favor by insisting that device manufacturers bundle its search engine with Android software to gain full access to the Android app store. This charge mirrors a similar accusation leveled against Microsoft in 1998 when it was alleged that Microsoft forced computer makers to feature its Internet Explorer browser alongside its dominant Windows operating system.

However, Google refutes these allegations, asserting that despite controlling about 90% of the internet search market, it faces significant competition. The company cites competitors ranging from search engines like Microsoft's Bing to websites such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Yelp (NYSE: ). From Google's perspective, continuous improvements to its search engine are what keep users returning, a habit that has made ""Googling"" synonymous with online searches.

Top executives from Google and its parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, are expected to testify during the trial. Court documents also suggest that high-ranking Apple executive Eddy Cue might be called to testify.

The legal battle could potentially disrupt Google's focus and operations, similar to what happened to Microsoft following its antitrust showdown with the Justice Department. If the trial concludes with concessions that undermine Google's power, the company might be forced to stop paying Apple and other firms to make Google the default search engine on smartphones and computers.

The trial commences shortly after the 25th anniversary of Google's first investment, a $100,000 check from Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim that enabled Larry Page and Sergey Brin to establish their business in a Silicon Valley garage. Today, Alphabet is valued at $1.7 trillion, employs over 182,000 people, and generates most of its revenue from $224 billion in annual ad sales through a network of digital services centered around its search engine.

US District Judge Amit Mehta is expected to issue a ruling early next year. If Google is found guilty of market manipulation, a subsequent trial will be scheduled to determine appropriate measures to rein in the California-based company.

In her meeting with CEOs of four US companies who are at the forefront of AI innovation, which also saw US President Joe Biden dropping by, she stressed that in order to realise the benefits that might come from advances in AI, ""it is imperative to mitigate both the current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society, and national security"".

""These include risks to safety, security, human and civil rights, privacy, jobs, and democratic values,"" the White House had said in a statement.

Harris told the CEOs that advances in technology have always presented opportunities and risks, and generative AI is no different.

The White House also announced more funding and policy guidance for developing responsible AI.

The activity has been codenamed ""Evil Telegram"" by the researchers.

""Our experts discovered several infected apps on Google Play under the guise of Uyghur, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese versions of Telegram. The app descriptions are written in the respective languages and contain images very similar to those on the official Telegram page on Google Play,"" the researchers said.

Moreover, the report said that to convince users to download these fake apps instead of the official app, the developer claims that they work faster than other clients thanks to a distributed network of data centres around the world.

At first glance, these apps appear to be full-fledged Telegram clones with a localised interface. Everything looks and works almost the same as the real thing, according to the researchers.

The researchers then looked inside the code and found the apps to be little more than slightly modified versions of the official one.

They found a small difference that escaped the attention of the Google Play moderators -- the infected versions house an additional module, which constantly monitors what’s happening in the messenger and sends masses of data to the spyware creators’ command-and-control server, the report mentioned.

Before Google took the apps down, they had been downloaded millions of times.

The feature appeared on our Pixel Fold as a ""Fix it"" prompt with Google's usual generative AI symbol. A pop-up then explains how proofreading works, with text being sent to Google for processing if you enable the feature.

“The text that’s proofread will be sent to Google and temporarily processed to create grammar and writing suggestions,” the pop-up message reads.

Users will be able to use the feature only if they accept these terms and conditions.

Tapping ""Proofread"" in Gboard's toolbar processes users' text and provides suggestions for spelling and grammar corrections, such as punctuation. Meanwhile, the ""Fix it"" button will appear alongside the suggestions and, when clicked, will automatically fix errors, the report said.

Meanwhile, Google has announced to give its Android brand a new makeover, adopting “Android” with a capital A instead of all lowercase letters and updating the bug droid logo to a 3D avatar.

In addition to moving away from the lowercase stylisation of “android,” the company is elevating the Android logo by capitalising the “A,” adding more weight to its appearance when placed next to Google’s logo.

“While we’ve added more curves and personality unique to Android, the new Android stylisation more closely mirrors Google’s logo and creates balance between the two,” said the company.

The analyst comments ""The long awaited USA vs. Google (NASDAQ: ) trial is set to begin next week on September 12. The trial will determine if Google has unlawfully maintained monopoly power through a set of exclusive contracts with distribution partners including web browser developers—most notably Apple—and Android OEMs (i.e. Samsung (KS: )) & carriers (i.e. Verizon (NYSE: )). In this report we look at some potential outcomes of the trial and analyze the potential financial impact. Going in, many on the Street may view the trial as a win-win for Google, meaning that either: 1) rulings fully in their favor would preserve the status quo; or 2) that Google could “lose” and would no longer have certain search distribution agreements, which could enable the company to recoup tens of billions of dollars in TAC payouts with perhaps only negligible impact to overall search volume, market share, and revenue. While fundamentally that rationale makes sense, in reality there is likely a wider range of outcomes as the trial will consider multiple claims. We estimate Google will pay out nearly $30B to search distribution partners in 2022, or about 17% of Google Search & Other Gross Revenue. We don’t know the exact numbers, but we’re assuming roughly $20B of that goes to Apple (NASDAQ: ), $8B goes to Android OEMs & carriers, and $2B goes to smaller browsers. We believe that Google winning on all counts and preserving the status quo would likely be the best outcome. While it might not result in the most earnings power/EPS, it would ensure search distribution going forward. Conversely, rulings that end all commercial deals (“losing”) could reduce TAC payments by $30B+, which could drive a 30%+ increase in EPS assuming that full search volume and market share are maintained. Realistically though, Google might lose a small amount of share, and would almost certainly find other opportunities in which to invest. Our analysis suggests that if Google recouped all TAC payments, holding other things equal, it could lose 20%+ of all search revenue before seeing a negative impact to EPS. Realistically however, anything more than a 5% loss would become concerning to the Street in our view. Still, we believe losing distribution deals introduces the risk that a competitor (Microsoft’s Bing?) could become the default search provider on platforms where Google is the default today, or that Apple could develop or acquire its own search engine. Additionally, the risk of search competition could increase as Generative AI evolves."""
2022-09-08, Investing.com,Full restriction of TAC payments; worst-case scenario for Google and Apple - Morgan Stanley,https://in.investing.com/news/full-restriction-of-tac-payments-worstcase-scenario-for-google-and-apple--morgan-stanley-432SI-3802383,"In a note to clients Friday, Morgan Stanley analysts assessed the DoJ vs. Google trial and why it matters to both Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ).

The trial is scheduled to begin on September 12, with the DoJ alleging that Google illegally obtained its dominance in search and search advertising.

According to the analysts, the key question is whether a final ruling could result in changes to Google's Search contracts with hardware OEMs (i.e. Apple, Samsung (KS: ), etc.), wireless carriers, and web browser companies.

""We would expect the judge to focus on Section 2 of the Sherman Act... which makes it illegal to acquire or maintain a monopoly through improper means,"" they wrote. While the initial ruling is possible by the end of 2022, the appeals process could push the final decision into mid-to-late 2024.

According to the analysts, there are three potential scenarios: Status Quo, Structural Contract Changes, and Full TAC Removal.

For the status quo scenario, they stated: ""If the Court rules that there is legal basis for Google's TAC payments to Apple, Samsung, and others, then there likely won't be a material change to the nature of these contracts... and as a result no change to Google or Apple's P&L."" This is the best-case scenario for Apple and companies that receive TAC payments from Google, while it will also be positive for the search engine giant too, Morgan Stanley believes.

For structural contract changes, the analysts said: ""In this scenario, the Court could rule that Google cannot pay for default search engine placement, but that Apple and others are still allowed to charge variable TAC based on search revenue generated. TAC payments would fall, but the removal of exclusivity could cause some users to switch away from GOOGL.""

In the case of a full restriction of TAC payments, Morgan Stanley explains: ""In this (most extreme) scenario, Google would be unable to make any payments for TAC to OEM partners. On the plus side, this would remove an estimated ~$28bn of annual US distribution TAC from GOOGL's P&L in '25. On the risk side, it again may cause some US users to switch to other search engines (i.e. Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.)."" Even so, the investment bank said their math suggests that more than 37% of current US users would have to switch to an alternative search engine for there to be a drag on Google's net revenue. However, it is the worst-case scenario for Apple as they would no longer be paid TAC for making Google the default search browser on Safari."

""AMOS was first advertised in April 2022 as a stealer for Mac OS with a strong focus on crypto assets, capable of harvesting passwords from browsers and Apple (NASDAQ: )'s keychain, as well as featuring a file grabber.

Criminals who purchase the toolkit distribute the malware primarily through cracked software downloads, but they also impersonate legitimate websites and use ads on search engines such as Google to lure victims in.

According to the report, users who want to download a new programme naturally go to Google and search for it. Threat actors are purchasing advertisements that look like well-known brands and tricking victims into visiting their site as if it were the official one.

Once the user clicks the link, they are presented with a normal-looking page. The attackers create a near-perfect clone of the website users expect, so they click through and download the software.

After opening the file, a fake prompt for the system password appears repeatedly until the user relents and enters their password.

Using generative AI to drive higher ROICs in media and internet will become table stakes within 3-5 years, we estimate. Use it or lose it (via bankruptcy) is our key investment conclusion,” they added.

While the analysts say it’s hard to pick winners and losers now, they believe that clear winners could prove to be “the arms dealers that house large language models (LLMs).”

“Today, the 3 LLM front-runners are , and . We believe these 3 companies will grow their market caps to be larger than AAPL's $3T.”

The analysts argue that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is “not a core beneficiary of the trend toward generative AI because it is not an arms dealer.”

“We assume AAPL can protect its best-in-class ecosystem from defections, but we believe Android/GOOGL will grow to be a larger company driven by its Cloud business, generative AI capabilities, and best in class 1st-party global consumer data,” they concluded."

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Google to mandate AI disclosure for election ads from mid-November,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-mandate-ai-disclosure-for-election-ads-from-midnovember-93CH-3799714,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google has announced a policy update that will require all election advertisers to disclose when their messages have been altered or created by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This policy, which applies starting mid-November 2022, necessitates election advertisers across Google's platforms to alert viewers when their ads contain content generated or edited by AI.

Advertisers are required to include clear language such as ""This audio was computer generated,"" or ""This image does not depict real events"" on altered election ads across Google's platforms. However, the policy does not apply to minor fixes such as image resizing or brightening.

The new policy aims at enhancing transparency in political advertising and addressing concerns about the potential misuse of AI in spreading misinformation. It comes amid growing scrutiny over the role of technology companies in election campaigns and their impact on democratic processes.

In addition to the disclosure requirement, Google will also enforce penalties for violations of the policy. These could include removing the offending ads and potentially suspending the advertiser's account. The company stated that it would use both automated and human review processes to ensure compliance with the policy.

The move by Google follows similar steps taken by other tech giants to combat misinformation in political advertising. It also reflects increasing public and regulatory attention to the ethical implications of AI use in various sectors, including advertising and elections.

It is important to note that the disclosure requirement applies only to election-related advertisements. Other types of ads that use AI-generated content will not be subject to this rule. However, this step could set a precedent for broader regulation of AI use in advertising in the future.

Google's decision has been met with mixed reactions from industry stakeholders. Some have applauded it as a necessary measure for maintaining trust in digital advertising, while others have raised concerns about its implementation and potential impact on smaller advertisers who may lack the resources to comply with these new requirements.

As we approach mid-November, advertisers are expected to adapt their strategies and practices accordingly, ensuring they adhere to Google's updated policy guidelines.

2022-09-06, Investing.com,Apple rumored to develop low-cost MacBook series for education sector,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-rumored-to-develop-lowcost-macbook-series-for-education-sector-93CH-3799201,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly developing a new series of low-cost MacBook models aimed at competing with Google (NASDAQ: )'s Chromebooks and entry-level Windows laptops in the education sector, according to a report by DigiTimes citing industry sources. The rumored MacBook series is expected to be launched as early as the second half of 2024.

The upcoming MacBook models are anticipated to come with the usual metal casing, but may incorporate less expensive materials and components in order to reduce costs. This strategy would set them apart from the existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.

As of today, Apple's cheapest laptop is the M1-powered MacBook Air 13-inch, available at a starting price of Rs. 99,900 in India. This device features a 13.3-inch IPS Retina display with a resolution of 1,600x2,560 pixels and is powered by the Apple M1 chip. It also offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of onboard storage, an HD FaceTime camera, a Touch ID sensor, and stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Atmos.

The move by Apple comes amid growing competition in the affordable PC market, particularly from Google's Chromebooks and multiple entry-level Windows laptops. These devices have gained popularity among students and within the education sector. According to the DigiTimes report, more than 13.9 million Chromebooks were shipped in 2019, over 30.4 million units in 2020, and more than 33.5 million Chromebooks in 2021. Apple is expected to target this robust market with its upcoming MacBook laptops priced under $1,000 (roughly Rs. 80,000).

However, Apple has not officially announced any plans for the development or release of affordable MacBook models yet.

Earlier this year in June, during its annual developer conference WWDC 2022, Apple launched its MacBook Air 15 with a starting price of Rs. 1,34,900. The company also unveiled its first mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, alongside other new Mac models and upcoming software updates during the same event.

The details of the settlement were disclosed in a court filing on Tuesday, however, the specifics, including the settlement amount, were not revealed.

The settlement, if approved, will allow Google to avoid a trial in which 21 million users sought damages in an antitrust lawsuit. These users claimed they were overcharged in the company's app marketplace. This tentative deal follows a decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco in July, who rescinded his order granting the plaintiffs class-action status, indicating that the case could advance as a group lawsuit. However, he also stated that he would reconsider the matter.

The complaints against Google allege that the tech giant inflated Android app prices by taking, with some exceptions, a 30% cut of sales on Google Play. State attorneys general in their 2021 complaint argued that Google used anticompetitive tactics to block competition and ensure that developers have no choice but to go through the Google Play store to reach users.

Lawyers representing Utah's attorney general, proposed class-action plaintiffs and Google have asked a judge to cancel a trial that was scheduled for early November. According to the court filing, if the judge rejects the settlement for any reason, both sides will be ""returned to their respective litigation positions."" The parties proposed reporting on the status of the deal at an Oct. 12 hearing.

As of now, lawyers for the consumers and a Google spokesperson have not responded to requests for comment regarding this development. The case is known as In Re Google Play Store Antitrust Litigation, 21-md-02981, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

2022-09-06, Investing.com,EU labels six major tech groups as ,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-labels-six-major-tech-groups-as-gatekeepers-under-new-competition-rules-3798803,"Investing.com -- The European Union has listed six tech giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ), as so-called ""gatekeepers"" that must adhere to the bloc's strict digital regulations.

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

Google responded to the announcement in a blog post, saying it will continue to work closely with EU Commission and ""other stakeholders"" as it ""review[s] our designation decision and assess[es] its implications."""
2022-09-06, IANS,EU designates 6 Big Tech gatekeepers under DMA with provisions for hefty fines,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-designates-6-big-tech-gatekeepers-under-dma-with-provisions-for-hefty-fines-3798651,"London, Sep 6 (IANS) The European Commission on Wednesday designated, for the first time, six gatekeepers -- Alphabet (Google (NASDAQ: )'s parent company), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, Meta (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) -- under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) with provisions for hefty penalties for non-compliance.In total, 22 core platform services provided by gatekeepers have been designated in the EU.

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

While it may bolster the online gaming industry, it has raised serious concerns about impacting the mental and physical well-being of children and young adults in the country.South Korean video game developer Krafton’s Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), the popular battle royale game that enthralled the country's gaming community, relaunched in May albeit with a government rider where it would be closely monitored every quarter for additional factors, including user harm and addiction.

The game has reportedly received the official approval from the Indian government to continue in the country, amassing millions of young users.

BGMI has even roped in Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh to promote the game in the country.

Another popular banned game, Free Fire from Singapore-based gaming company Garena, has also made its return in the country, starting this week.

Prior to their suspensions last year, BGMI and Free Fire ranked among India's highest-grossing Android apps.

Since its re-launch in May, BGMI swiftly regained its status as the leading Android app by revenue on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store in India.

The games, before the ban, had received widespread criticism for its addictive nature and its negative influence on young players.

Their relaunch has once again reignited the debate on the harmful effects of excessive gaming.

“Strategic violent virtual games are known to cause a host of problems in young impressionable minds. They are associated with disturbed sleep wake cycle, irritability, disobedience, conduct problems, disrespectful behaviour, disturbed relationships, neglect of meaningful priorities of life, academic decline, decreased and unhealthy social interactions, unhealthy lifestyle and unhealthy communication styles,” Dr. Sameer Malhotra, Director and Head - Department of Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, told IANS.

The games can also lead one to “neglect of self care, lose meaningful purpose of life, distress and compulsive behaviours, impulse dyscontrol, anger issues, self harming tendencies, and somatic pain like body aches and headaches”, he added.

Video games are a source of entertainment and relaxation and have also shown to boost a person’s cognitive skills, creativity, communication and reflexes.

But studies report that their addictive nature stimulates some of the reward centres of the brain, resulting in multiple behavioural mental and health issues.

Dr Trideep Choudhury, Consultant Psychiatrist at Fortis Flt Lt Rajan Dhall Hospital, Vasant Kunj, told IANS that these games encourage the players to achieve different targets and once these targets are achieved by the individual playing the game, it brings a sense of self efficiency to the player and increases their self esteem.

“This reinforces the game playing behaviour in the adolescent who at this age are trying to find their identity. Thus these online games can bring a false sense of self efficiency, decreasing their interests and interactions in the physical world , which can negatively affect the development of social skills and other life skills,” he said.

Further, Dr Choudhury said being hooked to online games can also affect relationships with their immediate family members and affect their sleep and academics.

According to a 2022 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), online gaming also compels children to a sedentary life by reducing opportunities for physical activity is one of the main drivers of obesity -- a precursor to several diseases including cancer, Type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions.

It is also the main cause of disability, the report said. In such a scenario, parents and teachers play crucial roles in protecting the children’s health and wellbeing.

Dr Malhotra advised parents and teachers to start by informing kids about the dangers posed by these games, encouraging open discussions to make sure youngsters feel comfortable sharing their online activities, and establishing clear limitations for screen time and gaming.

“Parents can use parental control apps and monitoring tools to keep a close eye on their children's online activity, and teachers can keep an eye on students' digital behaviour in the classroom. Teaching children to think analytically can help them analyse internet content, while promoting outside activities will help them balance their screen time,” he said.

However, educationist Meeta Sengupta said that it’s imperative to build good communication, trust with children while also helping them train in self control.

She advised parents and teachers to put in “psychological nudges in everyday practice” where you're approving of the variety of kids’ actions rather than always disapproving.

“I see this as an opportunity to give respect to our children and help them build the child's trust in themselves and in their own self control. “Every time the child puts down the game, say how wonderful you are that you were able to move away and do something that is equally making you even more happy,” Sengupta told IANS.

According to Nikita Tomar Mann, principal at Noida-based Indraprastha Global School (IPGS), with the entry of mobile video games in the market, many of which are revamped versions of the likes of PUBG, “there is a new challenge for the parents of growing children”.

“The adolescent children are the most at-risk age group as, with the bodily changes comes rebelliousness and defiance in following instructions. These digital challenges are here to stay and it is important that parents and students are regularly apprised of the negative and addictive nature of such video games through digital literacy sessions, highlighting case-studies etc,” Mann told IANS.

Imposing restrictions on usage will only lead to increasing curiosity and experimentation by children, which is likely to be more detrimental in nature, she emphasised.

“While we’ve added more curves and personality unique to Android, the new Android stylisation more closely mirrors Google’s logo and creates balance between the two,” said the company.

These small but significant updates to the Android typeface will better communicate the relationship between Android devices and the Google apps and services, the company added.

“Our new visuals draw inspiration from Material design to complement the Google brand palette, as well as be adaptable. The refreshed and dynamic robot shows up where Android connects with people, community and cultural moments. It can reflect individual passions, personality and context,” said Google.

The company also announced to give the most recognisable non-human member of our Android community an entirely new 3D look.

The bugdroid — the face and most identifiable element of the Android robot — now appears with more dimension, and a lot more character.

""As a visual signifier of our brand, we wanted the bugdroid to appear as dynamic as Android itself. We've also updated the robot’s full-body appearance to ensure it can easily transition between digital and real-life environments,” the company informed.

2022-09-06, IANS,"From dad to son, Pichai recollects how Google transformed lives in last 25 yrs",https://in.investing.com/news/from-dad-to-son-pichai-recollects-how-google-transformed-lives-in-last-25-yrs-3798022,"New Delhi, Sep 6 (IANS) As Google (NASDAQ: ) celebrates its 25th birthday this month, its CEO Sundar Pichai has reminisced about how technology has changed the way we communicate, create and innovate.Celebrating Google’s rich history of events (the company will officially celebrate its 25th birthday later this month), Pichai said it's time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.

“Years ago, when I was studying in the US, my dad -- who was back in India -- got his first email address. I was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) way to communicate with him, so I sent a message.

“And then I waited…and waited. It was two full days before I got this reply Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well,” he wrote late on Tuesday.

Fast forward to a few months ago.

“I was with my teenage son. He saw something interesting, took some quick pictures and shared them with his friends. Then they exchanged a few messages, and it all seemed faster than the time it would take me just to pull out my phone,” said Pichai.

“How I communicated with my dad all those years ago compared with how my son communicates today shows just how much change can happen across generations,” he noted.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California.

The company -- now part of the parent group called Alphabet and run by Indian-origin Pichai -- has diversified into several tech streams and launched several products.

“Larry and Sergey first wrote down our mission 25 years ago: to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions,” said Pichai.

Search is still at the core of the mission, and it’s still the biggest moonshot with so much more to do, according to him.

“Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each,” Pichai informed.

The company rapidly grew to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud, Chrome, YouTube, Workspace, Android operating system, cloud storage Drive, Google Translate), video chat app Meet, Pixel smartphones, Google Assistant, Bard AI and more.

Google has been investing in AI since almost the beginning. They were one of the first to use machine learning in their products, starting in the early 2000s.

“Now, generative AI is helping us reimagine our core products in exciting ways -- from our new Search Generative Experience (SGE), to “Help Me Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI,” said Pichai.

One million people are already using generative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where over 460 million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more.

“We’ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change,” according to Pichai.

Pichai was appointed as CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.

“Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know we succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work. Thanks for an amazing 25,” he noted.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,"Arm Holdings gears up for a major IPO, targeting a $52 billion valuation",https://in.investing.com/news/arm-holdings-gears-up-for-a-major-ipo-targeting-a-52-billion-valuation-93CH-3797891,"British chip designer, Arm Holdings, is preparing for a significant initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to be the largest of the year. The company has priced its IPO in a range that would value it at up to $52 billion, according to a filing on Tuesday. This valuation is below a $64 billion calculation following a recent stake sale involving its current owner SoftBank (TSE:TYO: ).

SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of total shares outstanding in the offering. The IPO will test market appetite for an important technology company in an environment of high interest rates. Despite the lower-than-expected valuation, Arm remains optimistic, as it aims to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares priced between $47 and $51 each.

Arm's technology powers chips inside nearly every smartphone globally. It hopes that several of its partners, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), will invest in its IPO as strategic investors. Such investments could potentially push up the valuation.

However, Arm's exposure to the sluggish smartphone market and the Chinese market have raised questions among analysts about its growth trajectory. Albie Amankona, an analyst at Third Bridge, expressed skepticism about the long-term sustainability of revenue growth and high margins of ARM in a research note on Monday. He predicts a yearly revenue growth of 5-10% for the next five years, followed by a peak and subsequent contraction on a yearly basis.

In its most recent fiscal year, Arm generated $2.68 billion of revenue and net income of $524 million. The company's targeted valuation suggests a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 92 to 100 times, less than Nvidia's 117 times but significantly higher than other chip makers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), which trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 15 times.

The city was chosen as the starting point due to the presence of T. Rowe Price's headquarters there, highlighting the fund manager's importance as a potential investor.

The company announced earlier on Tuesday that it aims to raise approximately $4.9 billion from its IPO, which would value the firm at over $52 billion. If achieved, this would make it the largest stock market flotation of 2022.

In addition to T. Rowe Price, Arm also held meetings with other potential investors on Tuesday, including Arlington, Virginia-based Sands Capital. The company plans to meet with more investors in various cities, such as New York, leading up to the pricing of its IPO scheduled for September 13.

Many of Arm's major clients have already committed to investing in the IPO. These include tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (KS: ). Furthermore, Arm disclosed that cornerstone investors have separately indicated an interest in purchasing a combined total of $735 million worth of the American Depositary Shares (ADS) being sold through the IPO.

While Arm declined to comment on these developments, T. Rowe Price and Sands Capital have yet to respond to requests for comments. The roadshow is expected to underscore the significance of these fund managers and other potential investors in ensuring a successful flotation for Arm Holdings.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,"Tech sector set to continue market dominance, says Goldman Sachs",https://in.investing.com/news/tech-sector-set-to-continue-market-dominance-says-goldman-sachs-93CH-3797773,"Technology companies are set to maintain their dominance in the stock market, according to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Monday. The bank emphasized that factors such as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and massive spending on research and development (R&D) will help solidify the sector's leadership position.

The tech sector has been leading the stock market since Apple (NASDAQ: ) became the world's largest company about a decade ago. Despite the ever-changing landscape of the top companies and sectors represented in the , Goldman Sachs predicts that the tech sector's lead is not likely to end in the near future.

Goldman Sachs provided three reasons why dominant tech companies may maintain their size in the current cycle longer than in previous technology cycles. Firstly, the bank noted that technology is deflationary, lowering prices for consumers and giving lawmakers no incentive to attack the sector from a pricing standpoint.

Secondly, technology is now considered a national security issue. Cybersecurity, chips, and increasingly AI are seen as critical parts of national infrastructure and strategic defense, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions worldwide.

Lastly, technology companies' ability to invest in themselves is a significant factor. Goldman Sachs pointed out that incumbent winners in the tech sector are so cash-generative that they can sustain this investment, strengthening their market 'moat' and potential future growth. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, over 60% of intangible digital investment comes from the top 10% of firms by market value.

The ratio of growth capital expenditure (capex), including R&D, as a share of operating cash flow is higher in technology than in any other sector. Tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are spending more than $100 billion in capex, a large portion of which is allocated to cloud computing and AI. Generative AI is likely the fastest-growing category within this investment.

“Many of these companies (including AAPL) are about to get dwarfed by generative AI, in our view,” they wrote in a report to clients.

Companies that integrate generative AI into their business practices can benefit from faster product and content introductions, leading to higher revenues and 20-30% lower costs, according to the analysts.

“In the US, where capitalism reigns supreme, tech-enhanced competitors will put companies out of business that aren't equally tech-first, in our view. Using generative AI to drive higher ROICs in media and internet will become table stakes within 3-5 years, we estimate. Use it or lose it (via bankruptcy) is our key investment conclusion,” they added.

While the analysts say it’s hard to pick winners and losers now, they believe that clear winners could prove to be “the arms dealers that house large language models (LLMs).”

“Today, the 3 LLM front-runners are , and . We believe these 3 companies will grow their market caps to be larger than AAPL's $3T.”

The analysts argue that Apple (NASDAQ: ) is “not a core beneficiary of the trend toward generative AI because it is not an arms dealer.”

“We assume AAPL can protect its best-in-class ecosystem from defections, but we believe Android/GOOGL will grow to be a larger company driven by its Cloud business, generative AI capabilities, and best in class 1st-party global consumer data,” they concluded."

2022-09-07, Investing.com,Google to mandate AI disclosure for election ads from mid-November,https://in.investing.com/news/google-to-mandate-ai-disclosure-for-election-ads-from-midnovember-93CH-3799714,"Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.'s Google has announced a policy update that will require all election advertisers to disclose when their messages have been altered or created by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This policy, which applies starting mid-November 2022, necessitates election advertisers across Google's platforms to alert viewers when their ads contain content generated or edited by AI.

Advertisers are required to include clear language such as ""This audio was computer generated,"" or ""This image does not depict real events"" on altered election ads across Google's platforms. However, the policy does not apply to minor fixes such as image resizing or brightening.

The new policy aims at enhancing transparency in political advertising and addressing concerns about the potential misuse of AI in spreading misinformation. It comes amid growing scrutiny over the role of technology companies in election campaigns and their impact on democratic processes.

In addition to the disclosure requirement, Google will also enforce penalties for violations of the policy. These could include removing the offending ads and potentially suspending the advertiser's account. The company stated that it would use both automated and human review processes to ensure compliance with the policy.

The move by Google follows similar steps taken by other tech giants to combat misinformation in political advertising. It also reflects increasing public and regulatory attention to the ethical implications of AI use in various sectors, including advertising and elections.

It is important to note that the disclosure requirement applies only to election-related advertisements. Other types of ads that use AI-generated content will not be subject to this rule. However, this step could set a precedent for broader regulation of AI use in advertising in the future.

Google's decision has been met with mixed reactions from industry stakeholders. Some have applauded it as a necessary measure for maintaining trust in digital advertising, while others have raised concerns about its implementation and potential impact on smaller advertisers who may lack the resources to comply with these new requirements.

As we approach mid-November, advertisers are expected to adapt their strategies and practices accordingly, ensuring they adhere to Google's updated policy guidelines.

2022-09-06, Investing.com,Apple rumored to develop low-cost MacBook series for education sector,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-rumored-to-develop-lowcost-macbook-series-for-education-sector-93CH-3799201,"Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). is reportedly developing a new series of low-cost MacBook models aimed at competing with Google (NASDAQ: )'s Chromebooks and entry-level Windows laptops in the education sector, according to a report by DigiTimes citing industry sources. The rumored MacBook series is expected to be launched as early as the second half of 2024.

The upcoming MacBook models are anticipated to come with the usual metal casing, but may incorporate less expensive materials and components in order to reduce costs. This strategy would set them apart from the existing MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models.

As of today, Apple's cheapest laptop is the M1-powered MacBook Air 13-inch, available at a starting price of Rs. 99,900 in India. This device features a 13.3-inch IPS Retina display with a resolution of 1,600x2,560 pixels and is powered by the Apple M1 chip. It also offers up to 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of onboard storage, an HD FaceTime camera, a Touch ID sensor, and stereo speakers enhanced by Dolby Atmos.

The move by Apple comes amid growing competition in the affordable PC market, particularly from Google's Chromebooks and multiple entry-level Windows laptops. These devices have gained popularity among students and within the education sector. According to the DigiTimes report, more than 13.9 million Chromebooks were shipped in 2019, over 30.4 million units in 2020, and more than 33.5 million Chromebooks in 2021. Apple is expected to target this robust market with its upcoming MacBook laptops priced under $1,000 (roughly Rs. 80,000).

However, Apple has not officially announced any plans for the development or release of affordable MacBook models yet.

Earlier this year in June, during its annual developer conference WWDC 2022, Apple launched its MacBook Air 15 with a starting price of Rs. 1,34,900. The company also unveiled its first mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, alongside other new Mac models and upcoming software updates during the same event.

The details of the settlement were disclosed in a court filing on Tuesday, however, the specifics, including the settlement amount, were not revealed.

The settlement, if approved, will allow Google to avoid a trial in which 21 million users sought damages in an antitrust lawsuit. These users claimed they were overcharged in the company's app marketplace. This tentative deal follows a decision by U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco in July, who rescinded his order granting the plaintiffs class-action status, indicating that the case could advance as a group lawsuit. However, he also stated that he would reconsider the matter.

The complaints against Google allege that the tech giant inflated Android app prices by taking, with some exceptions, a 30% cut of sales on Google Play. State attorneys general in their 2021 complaint argued that Google used anticompetitive tactics to block competition and ensure that developers have no choice but to go through the Google Play store to reach users.

Lawyers representing Utah's attorney general, proposed class-action plaintiffs and Google have asked a judge to cancel a trial that was scheduled for early November. According to the court filing, if the judge rejects the settlement for any reason, both sides will be ""returned to their respective litigation positions."" The parties proposed reporting on the status of the deal at an Oct. 12 hearing.

As of now, lawyers for the consumers and a Google spokesperson have not responded to requests for comment regarding this development. The case is known as In Re Google Play Store Antitrust Litigation, 21-md-02981, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

2022-09-06, Investing.com,EU labels six major tech groups as ,https://in.investing.com/news/eu-labels-six-major-tech-groups-as-gatekeepers-under-new-competition-rules-3798803,"Investing.com -- The European Union has listed six tech giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Meta (NASDAQ: ), as so-called ""gatekeepers"" that must adhere to the bloc's strict digital regulations.

In a statement, the EU Commission said that Apple (NASDAQ: ), Tiktok-owner ByteDance, and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) have also received the new designation, giving them six months to comply with its Digital Markets Act (DMA). If they do not make the necessary changes in time, the firms could face fines of up to 10% of their total worldwide turnover. The figure could rise to 20% ""in case of repeated infringement,"" the EU said.

Under the legislation, the EU retains the power to label organizations as ""gatekeepers."" The term refers to large platforms that the EU believes are limiting access to key services like messaging, advertising, and online searches.

A total of 22 of these services were named in the EU's announcement on Wednesday. Among them were Google's eponymous search engine and Chrome browser, Meta's WhatsApp messaging platform, and Microsoft's LinkedIn networking website. Google's Gmail and Microsoft's rival web mail service Outlook.com made up some of the notable absentees from the list.

Elsewhere, the Commission also opened four market investigations to decide if Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising services do not qualify as gateways. Apple's iMessage platform faces a similar probe as well.

Google responded to the announcement in a blog post, saying it will continue to work closely with EU Commission and ""other stakeholders"" as it ""review[s] our designation decision and assess[es] its implications."""

The six gatekeepers will now have six months to ensure full compliance with the DMA obligations for each of their designated core platform services, the commission said in a statement.

In case a gatekeeper does not comply with the obligations laid down by the DMA, the Commission can impose fines up to 10 per cent of the company's total worldwide turnover, which can go up to 20 per cent in case of repeated infringement.

“With today’s designation we are finally reining in the economic power of 6 gatekeepers, giving more choice to consumers and creating new opportunities for smaller innovative tech companies, thanks for instance to interoperability, sideloading, real-time data portability and fairness,” said Thierry Breton, Commissioner for Internal Market.

In parallel, the Commission has also opened four market investigations to further assess Microsoft’s and Apple’s submissions arguing that, despite meeting the thresholds, some of their core platform services do not qualify as gateways, like Microsoft: Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising and Apple’s iMessage.

“Under the DMA, these investigations aim to ascertain whether a sufficiently substantiated rebuttal presented by the companies, demonstrate that services in question should not be designated. The investigation should be completed within a maximum of 5 months,” said the Commission.

In addition, the Commission opened a market investigation to further assess whether Apple’s iPadOS should be designated as gatekeeper, despite not meeting the thresholds. Under the DMA, this investigation should be completed within a maximum of 12 months.

Moreover, the Commission found that, although Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung (KS: ) Internet Browser meet the thresholds under the DMA to qualify as a gatekeeper, Alphabet, Microsoft and Samsung provided sufficiently justified arguments showing that these services do not qualify as gateways for the respective core platform services.

“Therefore, the Commission decided not to designate Gmail, Outlook.com and Samsung Internet Browser as core platform services. It follows that Samsung is not designated as gatekeeper with respect to any core platform service,” it said.

The Commission said it will monitor the effective implementation of and compliance with these obligations.

In case of systematic infringements, the Commission is also empowered to adopt additional remedies such as obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it or banning the gatekeeper from acquisitions of additional services related to the systemic non-compliance.

2022-09-06, IANS,"How return of banned games like BGMI, Free Fire can hamper Indian kids’ overall health (Lead)",https://in.investing.com/news/how-return-of-banned-games-like-bgmi-free-fire-can-hamper-indian-kids-overall-health-lead-3798524,"New Delhi, Sep 6 (IANS) After almost several months of ban over national security reasons, a couple of Chinese games have returned to India in various formats and new avatars. While it may bolster the online gaming industry, it has raised serious concerns about impacting the mental and physical well-being of children and young adults in the country.South Korean video game developer Krafton’s Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), the popular battle royale game that enthralled the country's gaming community, relaunched in May albeit with a government rider where it would be closely monitored every quarter for additional factors, including user harm and addiction.

The game has reportedly received the official approval from the Indian government to continue in the country, amassing millions of young users.

BGMI has even roped in Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh to promote the game in the country.

Another popular banned game, Free Fire from Singapore-based gaming company Garena, has also made its return in the country, starting this week.

Prior to their suspensions last year, BGMI and Free Fire ranked among India's highest-grossing Android apps.

Since its re-launch in May, BGMI swiftly regained its status as the leading Android app by revenue on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store in India.

The games, before the ban, had received widespread criticism for its addictive nature and its negative influence on young players.

Their relaunch has once again reignited the debate on the harmful effects of excessive gaming.

“Strategic violent virtual games are known to cause a host of problems in young impressionable minds. They are associated with disturbed sleep wake cycle, irritability, disobedience, conduct problems, disrespectful behaviour, disturbed relationships, neglect of meaningful priorities of life, academic decline, decreased and unhealthy social interactions, unhealthy lifestyle and unhealthy communication styles,” Dr. Sameer Malhotra, Director and Head - Department of Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, told IANS.

The games can also lead one to “neglect of self care, lose meaningful purpose of life, distress and compulsive behaviours, impulse dyscontrol, anger issues, self harming tendencies, and somatic pain like body aches and headaches”, he added.

Video games are a source of entertainment and relaxation and have also shown to boost a person’s cognitive skills, creativity, communication and reflexes.

But studies report that their addictive nature stimulates some of the reward centres of the brain, resulting in multiple behavioural mental and health issues.

Dr Trideep Choudhury, Consultant Psychiatrist at Fortis Flt Lt Rajan Dhall Hospital, Vasant Kunj, told IANS that these games encourage the players to achieve different targets and once these targets are achieved by the individual playing the game, it brings a sense of self efficiency to the player and increases their self esteem.

“This reinforces the game playing behaviour in the adolescent who at this age are trying to find their identity. Thus these online games can bring a false sense of self efficiency, decreasing their interests and interactions in the physical world , which can negatively affect the development of social skills and other life skills,” he said.

Further, Dr Choudhury said being hooked to online games can also affect relationships with their immediate family members and affect their sleep and academics.

According to a 2022 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), online gaming also compels children to a sedentary life by reducing opportunities for physical activity is one of the main drivers of obesity -- a precursor to several diseases including cancer, Type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions.

It is also the main cause of disability, the report said. In such a scenario, parents and teachers play crucial roles in protecting the children’s health and wellbeing.

Dr Malhotra advised parents and teachers to start by informing kids about the dangers posed by these games, encouraging open discussions to make sure youngsters feel comfortable sharing their online activities, and establishing clear limitations for screen time and gaming.

“Parents can use parental control apps and monitoring tools to keep a close eye on their children's online activity, and teachers can keep an eye on students' digital behaviour in the classroom. Teaching children to think analytically can help them analyse internet content, while promoting outside activities will help them balance their screen time,” he said.

However, educationist Meeta Sengupta said that it’s imperative to build good communication, trust with children while also helping them train in self control.

She advised parents and teachers to put in “psychological nudges in everyday practice” where you're approving of the variety of kids’ actions rather than always disapproving.

“I see this as an opportunity to give respect to our children and help them build the child's trust in themselves and in their own self control. “Every time the child puts down the game, say how wonderful you are that you were able to move away and do something that is equally making you even more happy,” Sengupta told IANS.

According to Nikita Tomar Mann, principal at Noida-based Indraprastha Global School (IPGS), with the entry of mobile video games in the market, many of which are revamped versions of the likes of PUBG, “there is a new challenge for the parents of growing children”.

“The adolescent children are the most at-risk age group as, with the bodily changes comes rebelliousness and defiance in following instructions. These digital challenges are here to stay and it is important that parents and students are regularly apprised of the negative and addictive nature of such video games through digital literacy sessions, highlighting case-studies etc,” Mann told IANS.

Imposing restrictions on usage will only lead to increasing curiosity and experimentation by children, which is likely to be more detrimental in nature, she emphasised.

2022-09-06, IANS,"Google changing Android branding with 3D logo, modern look",https://in.investing.com/news/google-changing-android-branding-with-3d-logo-modern-look-3798240,"New Delhi, Sep 6 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has announced to give its Android brand a new makeover, adopting “Android” with a capital A instead of all lowercase letters and updating the bug droid logo to a 3D avatar.In addition to moving away from the lowercase stylisation of “android,” the company is elevating the Android logo by capitalising the “A,” adding more weight to its appearance when placed next to Google’s logo.

“While we’ve added more curves and personality unique to Android, the new Android stylisation more closely mirrors Google’s logo and creates balance between the two,” said the company.

These small but significant updates to the Android typeface will better communicate the relationship between Android devices and the Google apps and services, the company added.

“Our new visuals draw inspiration from Material design to complement the Google brand palette, as well as be adaptable. The refreshed and dynamic robot shows up where Android connects with people, community and cultural moments. It can reflect individual passions, personality and context,” said Google.

The company also announced to give the most recognisable non-human member of our Android community an entirely new 3D look.

The bugdroid — the face and most identifiable element of the Android robot — now appears with more dimension, and a lot more character.

""As a visual signifier of our brand, we wanted the bugdroid to appear as dynamic as Android itself. We've also updated the robot’s full-body appearance to ensure it can easily transition between digital and real-life environments,” the company informed.

The users will start seeing the new aspects of the brand identity, like the updated logo and 3D bugdroid, appear on Android devices and in more places starting this year.

Google is also introducing new updates for its Android apps including a new Assistant widget, support for Zoom and Webex on Android Auto, and accessibility updates for the Lookup app.

2022-09-06, IANS,"Return of banned games like BGMI, Free Fire bad for Indian kids’ overall wellbeing: Experts",https://in.investing.com/news/return-of-banned-games-like-bgmi-free-fire-bad-for-indian-kids-overall-wellbeing-experts-3798239,"New Delhi, Sep 6 (IANS) After almost several months of ban over national security reasons, a couple of Chinese games have returned to India in various formats and new avatars. While it may bolster the online gaming industry, it has raised serious concerns about impacting the mental and physical well-being of children and young adults in the country.

South Korean video game developer Krafton’s Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), the popular battle royale game that enthralled the country's gaming community, relaunched in May albeit with a government rider where it would be closely monitored every quarter for additional factors, including user harm and addiction.

The game has reportedly received the official approval from the Indian government to continue in the country, amassing millions of young users.

BGMI has even roped in Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh to promote the game in the country.

Another popular banned game, Free Fire from Singapore-based gaming company Garena, has also made its return in the country, starting this week.

Prior to their suspensions last year, BGMI and Free Fire ranked among India's highest-grossing Android apps.

Since its re-launch in May, BGMI swiftly regained its status as the leading Android app by revenue on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store in India.

The games, before the ban, had received widespread criticism for its addictive nature and its negative influence on young players.

Their relaunch has once again reignited the debate on the harmful effects of excessive gaming.

“Strategic violent virtual games are known to cause a host of problems in young impressionable minds. They are associated with disturbed sleep wake cycle, irritability, disobedience, conduct problems, disrespectful behaviour, disturbed relationships, neglect of meaningful priorities of life, academic decline, decreased and unhealthy social interactions, unhealthy lifestyle and unhealthy communication styles,” Dr. Sameer Malhotra, Director and Head - Department of Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, told IANS.

The games can also lead one to “neglect of self care, lose meaningful purpose of life, distress and compulsive behaviours, impulse dyscontrol, anger issues, self harming tendencies, and somatic pain like body aches and headaches”, he added.

Video games are a source of entertainment and relaxation and have also shown to boost a person’s cognitive skills, creativity, communication and reflexes.

But studies report that their addictive nature stimulates some of the reward centres of the brain, resulting in multiple behavioural mental and health issues.

Dr Trideep Choudhury, Consultant Psychiatrist at Fortis Flt Lt Rajan Dhall Hospital, Vasant Kunj, told IANS that these games encourage the players to achieve different targets and once these targets are achieved by the individual playing the game, it brings a sense of self efficiency to the player and increases their self esteem.

“This reinforces the game playing behaviour in the adolescent who at this age are trying to find their identity. Thus these online games can bring a false sense of self efficiency, decreasing their interests and interactions in the physical world , which can negatively affect the development of social skills and other life skills,” he said.

Further, Dr Choudhury said being hooked to online games can also affect relationships with their immediate family members and affect their sleep and academics.

According to a 2022 report by the World Health Organization (WHO), online gaming also compels children to a sedentary life by reducing opportunities for physical activity is one of the main drivers of obesity -- a precursor to several diseases including cancer, Type-2 diabetes, heart problems and lung conditions.

It is also the main cause of disability, the report said. In such a scenario, parents and teachers play crucial roles in protecting the children’s health and wellbeing.

Dr Malhotra advised parents and teachers to start by informing kids about the dangers posed by these games, encouraging open discussions to make sure youngsters feel comfortable sharing their online activities, and establishing clear limitations for screen time and gaming.

“Parents can use parental control apps and monitoring tools to keep a close eye on their children's online activity, and teachers can keep an eye on students' digital behaviour in the classroom. Teaching children to think analytically can help them analyse internet content, while promoting outside activities will help them balance their screen time,” he said.

However, educationist Meeta Sengupta said that it’s imperative to build good communication, trust with children while also helping them train in self control.

She advised parents and teachers to put in “psychological nudges in everyday practice” where you're approving of the variety of kids’ actions rather than always disapproving.

“I see this as an opportunity to give respect to our children and help them build the child's trust in themselves and in their own self control. “Every time the child puts down the game, say how wonderful you are that you were able to move away and do something that is equally making you even more happy,” Sengupta told IANS.

According to Nikita Tomar Mann, principal at Noida-based Indraprastha Global School (IGPS), with the entry of mobile video games in the market, many of which are revamped versions of the likes of PUBG, “there is a new challenge for the parents of growing children”.

“The adolescent children are the most at-risk age group as, with the bodily changes comes rebelliousness and defiance in following instructions. These digital challenges are here to stay and it is important that parents and students are regularly apprised of the negative and addictive nature of such video games through digital literacy sessions, highlighting case-studies etc,” Mann told IANS.

Imposing restrictions on usage will only lead to increasing curiosity and experimentation by children, which is likely to be more detrimental in nature, she emphasised.

2022-09-06, IANS,"From dad to son, Pichai recollects how Google transformed lives in last 25 yrs",https://in.investing.com/news/from-dad-to-son-pichai-recollects-how-google-transformed-lives-in-last-25-yrs-3798022,"New Delhi, Sep 6 (IANS) As Google (NASDAQ: ) celebrates its 25th birthday this month, its CEO Sundar Pichai has reminisced about how technology has changed the way we communicate, create and innovate.Celebrating Google’s rich history of events (the company will officially celebrate its 25th birthday later this month), Pichai said it's time for some gratitude, and a moment to reflect.

“Years ago, when I was studying in the US, my dad -- who was back in India -- got his first email address. I was really excited to have a faster (and cheaper) way to communicate with him, so I sent a message.

“And then I waited…and waited. It was two full days before I got this reply Dear Mr. Pichai, email received. All is well,” he wrote late on Tuesday.

Fast forward to a few months ago.

“I was with my teenage son. He saw something interesting, took some quick pictures and shared them with his friends. Then they exchanged a few messages, and it all seemed faster than the time it would take me just to pull out my phone,” said Pichai.

“How I communicated with my dad all those years ago compared with how my son communicates today shows just how much change can happen across generations,” he noted.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California.

The company -- now part of the parent group called Alphabet and run by Indian-origin Pichai -- has diversified into several tech streams and launched several products.

“Larry and Sergey first wrote down our mission 25 years ago: to organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. The product they built, Google Search, went on to help billions of people around the world get answers to their questions,” said Pichai.

Search is still at the core of the mission, and it’s still the biggest moonshot with so much more to do, according to him.

“Of course, Google today is more than a search box. We have 15 Google products that each serve more than half a billion people and businesses, and six that serve more than 2 billion users each,” Pichai informed.

The company rapidly grew to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud, Chrome, YouTube, Workspace, Android operating system, cloud storage Drive, Google Translate), video chat app Meet, Pixel smartphones, Google Assistant, Bard AI and more.

Google has been investing in AI since almost the beginning. They were one of the first to use machine learning in their products, starting in the early 2000s.

“Now, generative AI is helping us reimagine our core products in exciting ways -- from our new Search Generative Experience (SGE), to “Help Me Write” in Gmail. And earlier this year, we launched Bard, an early experiment that lets people collaborate with generative AI,” said Pichai.

One million people are already using generative AI in Google Workspace to write and create. Flood forecasting now covers places where over 460 million people live. A million researchers have used the AlphaFold database which covers 200 million predictions of protein structures, helping with advances to cut plastic pollution, tackle antibiotic resistance, fight malaria, and more.

“We’ve demonstrated how AI can help the airline industry to decrease contrails from planes, an important tool for fighting climate change,” according to Pichai.

Pichai was appointed as CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.

“Over time, AI will be the biggest technological shift we see in our lifetimes. And in 2048, if, somewhere in the world, a teenager looks at all we’ve built with AI and shrugs, we’ll know we succeeded. And then we’ll get back to work. Thanks for an amazing 25,” he noted.

2022-09-05, Investing.com,"Arm Holdings gears up for a major IPO, targeting a $52 billion valuation",https://in.investing.com/news/arm-holdings-gears-up-for-a-major-ipo-targeting-a-52-billion-valuation-93CH-3797891,"British chip designer, Arm Holdings, is preparing for a significant initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to be the largest of the year. The company has priced its IPO in a range that would value it at up to $52 billion, according to a filing on Tuesday. This valuation is below a $64 billion calculation following a recent stake sale involving its current owner SoftBank (TSE:TYO: ).

SoftBank plans to sell about 10% of total shares outstanding in the offering. The IPO will test market appetite for an important technology company in an environment of high interest rates. Despite the lower-than-expected valuation, Arm remains optimistic, as it aims to issue 95.5 million American depositary shares priced between $47 and $51 each.

Arm's technology powers chips inside nearly every smartphone globally. It hopes that several of its partners, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), will invest in its IPO as strategic investors. Such investments could potentially push up the valuation.

However, Arm's exposure to the sluggish smartphone market and the Chinese market have raised questions among analysts about its growth trajectory. Albie Amankona, an analyst at Third Bridge, expressed skepticism about the long-term sustainability of revenue growth and high margins of ARM in a research note on Monday. He predicts a yearly revenue growth of 5-10% for the next five years, followed by a peak and subsequent contraction on a yearly basis.

In its most recent fiscal year, Arm generated $2.68 billion of revenue and net income of $524 million. The company's targeted valuation suggests a trailing price-to-earnings multiple of 92 to 100 times, less than Nvidia's 117 times but significantly higher than other chip makers like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ), which trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 15 times.

The city was chosen as the starting point due to the presence of T. Rowe Price's headquarters there, highlighting the fund manager's importance as a potential investor.

The company announced earlier on Tuesday that it aims to raise approximately $4.9 billion from its IPO, which would value the firm at over $52 billion. If achieved, this would make it the largest stock market flotation of 2022.

In addition to T. Rowe Price, Arm also held meetings with other potential investors on Tuesday, including Arlington, Virginia-based Sands Capital. The company plans to meet with more investors in various cities, such as New York, leading up to the pricing of its IPO scheduled for September 13.

Many of Arm's major clients have already committed to investing in the IPO. These include tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ) and Samsung Electronics (KS: ). Furthermore, Arm disclosed that cornerstone investors have separately indicated an interest in purchasing a combined total of $735 million worth of the American Depositary Shares (ADS) being sold through the IPO.

While Arm declined to comment on these developments, T. Rowe Price and Sands Capital have yet to respond to requests for comments. The roadshow is expected to underscore the significance of these fund managers and other potential investors in ensuring a successful flotation for Arm Holdings.

The bank emphasized that factors such as emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and massive spending on research and development (R&D) will help solidify the sector's leadership position.

The tech sector has been leading the stock market since Apple (NASDAQ: ) became the world's largest company about a decade ago. Despite the ever-changing landscape of the top companies and sectors represented in the , Goldman Sachs predicts that the tech sector's lead is not likely to end in the near future.

Goldman Sachs provided three reasons why dominant tech companies may maintain their size in the current cycle longer than in previous technology cycles. Firstly, the bank noted that technology is deflationary, lowering prices for consumers and giving lawmakers no incentive to attack the sector from a pricing standpoint.

Secondly, technology is now considered a national security issue. Cybersecurity, chips, and increasingly AI are seen as critical parts of national infrastructure and strategic defense, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions worldwide.

Lastly, technology companies' ability to invest in themselves is a significant factor. Goldman Sachs pointed out that incumbent winners in the tech sector are so cash-generative that they can sustain this investment, strengthening their market 'moat' and potential future growth. According to Erik Brynjolfsson, over 60% of intangible digital investment comes from the top 10% of firms by market value.

The ratio of growth capital expenditure (capex), including R&D, as a share of operating cash flow is higher in technology than in any other sector. Tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) are spending more than $100 billion in capex, a large portion of which is allocated to cloud computing and AI. Generative AI is likely the fastest-growing category within this investment.

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are “privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren’t large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act”.

Microsoft is “unlikely” to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

However, it argues that Bing’s relatively small share in the global search market (compared to Google (NASDAQ: )) could only be further diminished with the new rules.

Apple is also reportedly working on ways that will open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloading to comply with new rules.

However, according to the report, the tech giant argues that iMessage shouldn’t have to “interoperate with other messaging services”.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

According to cybersecurity company ESET, the threat actors behind the malicious tool are the China-aligned APT group GREF.

The malicious Signal and Telegram apps hackers were using to infect users' devices are 'Signal Plus Messenger' and 'FlyGram'.

""Most likely active since July 2020 and since July 2022, respectively, the campaigns have distributed the Android BadBazaar espionage code through the Google Play store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and dedicated websites representing the malicious apps Signal Plus Messenger and FlyGram,"" said security researcher Lukas Stefanko.

The purpose of these trojanized apps is to exfiltrate user data. Specifically, FlyGram can extract basic device information, but also sensitive data, such as contact lists, call logs, and the list of Google Accounts.

FlyGram can access Telegram backups if the user enabled a specific feature added by the attackers; the feature was activated by at least 13,953 user accounts, the report said.

Signal Plus Messenger collects similar device data and sensitive information; however, its main goal is to spy on the victim's Signal communications - it can extract the Signal PIN number that protects the Signal account and abuses the link device feature that allows users to connect Signal Desktop and Signal iPad to their phones.

Previously, the BadBazaar malware was used to target Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic minorities.

FlyGram malware was also seen shared in a Uyghur Telegram group, which aligns with previous targeting of the BadBazaar malware family, according to the report.

Victims have been found primarily in Germany, Poland, and the US, with victims also discovered in Ukraine, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Congo-Kinshasa, Hong Kong, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and Yemen.

""Both Signal Plus Messenger and FlyGram are slightly different variants of BadBazaar that focus on user data exfiltration and espionage. However, it’s important to note that each of them possesses unique malicious functionalities,"" Stefanko said.

According to a report in The Financial Times, citing veteran YouTube staff, the short-video platform Shorts “risks cannibalising its core business”.

Google (NASDAQ: ) recently announced that Shorts now has more than 2 billion logged-in monthly users, giving it an edge over competitors like TikTok and Instagram Reels.

“Recent YouTube strategy meetings have discussed the risk that long-form videos, which produce more revenue for the company, are ‘dying out’ as a format,” the report mentioned late on Sunday.

YouTube staff feels that “content creators are making fewer long-form videos -- driven by a lack of consumer appetite and commissions from brands that favour short-form content for product placement”.

YouTube says Shorts was “designed to complement, not compete with, all the other formats creators use” on the platform, such as audio and livestreams.

YouTube’s ad revenue, though improved, had been on a downward year-over-year slide for three straight quarters.

The company is still figuring out how to earn more ad money from Shorts.

The latest YouTube Shorts usage is up from 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users for YouTube Shorts announced last year.

In its results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2022, Google reported that YouTube brought in $7.67 billion in advertising revenue.

This is 4 per cent higher than the same period last year.

The company introduced advertising on Shorts late last year.

YouTube now has to support Shorts as it gains immense popularity, like investing in creators and incentivising them to make exclusive content.

The Alliance will be a platform for major corporations “to mobilise resources and have a bridge with the current system of the UN and international partners on delivery of aid”, he said at a news conference after taking over the Council's rotating presidency.

This will be an extension to the humanitarian aid sector of the UN's efforts to tap into the massive resources of the private sector to fight climate change and to promote its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

He said that after observing at the Council many times the “unfortunate situation when needs are not met, where resources are not enough and when people in dire need are unfortunately not assisted”, Albania wanted to try a new approach.

Although the UN has been doing “the most fantastic and noble jobs”, its resources are limited and “we need to really enlarge the radius of contributions”, Hoxha said.

He said that Albania worked with other Council members and the corporate sector to see what can be done to improve the delivery of assistance.

Major corporations, which were approached, said that while they wanted to raise funds and make in kind contributions they did not know whom to contact or how to route them, Hoxha said.

The Alliance would provide them with a venue that they would manage for participating in the humanitarian activities of the UN, he said.

He said that he expected about 15 leaders of major corporations to be present when the briefings are made and the Alliance is formally launched.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been forging with the private sector with its mega multinational corporations with huge resources, global footprint and operations with far-reaching impacts in its missions, particularly in fighting climate change and meeting the UN’s broad-ranging

sustainable development goals (SDGs).

He set up in 2019 the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance with about 30 multinationals, including Infosys (NS: ) from India.

Based on Alphabet’s (Google’s parent company) turnover of last year, the competent authorities could also issue a fine of up to 11,28 billion euros, according to the complaint.

When creating an account with Fitbit, European users are obliged to “agree to the transfer of their data to the US and other countries with different data protection laws”.

This means that their data could end up in any country around the globe that does not have the same privacy protections as the EU.

""In other words, Fitbit forces its users to consent to sharing sensitive data without providing them with clear information about possible implications or the specific countries their data goes to,"" according to the noyb complaint.

This results in a consent that is neither free, informed or specific -- which means that the consent clearly doesn’t meet the GDPR’s requirements. The collected data can even be shared for processing with third-party companies of which we do not know where they are located. Furthermore, it is impossible for users to find out which specific data is affected, reads the complaint.

""First, you buy a Fitbit watch for at least 100 euros. Then you sign up for a paid subscription, only to find that you are forced to ‘freely’ agree to the sharing of your data with recipients around the world. Five years into the GDPR, Fitbit is still trying to enforce a ‘take it or leave it’ approach,” said Maartje de Graaf, Data Protection Lawyer at noyb.

Romain Robert, one of the complainants, said that “Fitbit may be a nice app to track your fitness, but once you want to learn more about how your data is being handled, you are bound for a marathon”.

According to The Financial Times, Microsoft and Apple are “privately (and separately) arguing that their services aren’t large or powerful enough to justify earning the restrictions of the Digital Markets Act”.

Microsoft is “unlikely” to dispute that its Windows platform meets the definition of a gatekeeper.

However, it argues that Bing’s relatively small share in the global search market (compared to Google (NASDAQ: )) could only be further diminished with the new rules.

Apple is also reportedly working on ways that will open up iOS to third-party app stores and sideloading to comply with new rules.

However, according to the report, the tech giant argues that iMessage shouldn’t have to “interoperate with other messaging services”.

Apple and Microsoft, along with Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet, Meta (NASDAQ: ), ByteDance, and Samsung (KS: ), will be part of the EU “gatekeepers” list and it will determine which products should be covered under the DMA.

The DMA establishes a set of clearly defined objective criteria to identify “gatekeepers”.

Gatekeepers are large digital platforms providing so called core platform services, such as for example online search engines, app stores, messenger services.

The DMA is one of the first regulatory tools to comprehensively regulate the gatekeeper power of the largest digital companies.

According to cybersecurity company ESET, the threat actors behind the malicious tool are the China-aligned APT group GREF.

The malicious Signal and Telegram apps hackers were using to infect users' devices are 'Signal Plus Messenger' and 'FlyGram'.

""Most likely active since July 2020 and since July 2022, respectively, the campaigns have distributed the Android BadBazaar espionage code through the Google Play store, Samsung Galaxy Store, and dedicated websites representing the malicious apps Signal Plus Messenger and FlyGram,"" said security researcher Lukas Stefanko.

The purpose of these trojanized apps is to exfiltrate user data. Specifically, FlyGram can extract basic device information, but also sensitive data, such as contact lists, call logs, and the list of Google Accounts.

FlyGram can access Telegram backups if the user enabled a specific feature added by the attackers; the feature was activated by at least 13,953 user accounts, the report said.

Signal Plus Messenger collects similar device data and sensitive information; however, its main goal is to spy on the victim's Signal communications - it can extract the Signal PIN number that protects the Signal account and abuses the link device feature that allows users to connect Signal Desktop and Signal iPad to their phones.

Previously, the BadBazaar malware was used to target Uyghurs and other Turkic ethnic minorities.

FlyGram malware was also seen shared in a Uyghur Telegram group, which aligns with previous targeting of the BadBazaar malware family, according to the report.

Victims have been found primarily in Germany, Poland, and the US, with victims also discovered in Ukraine, Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Congo-Kinshasa, Hong Kong, Hungary, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, and Yemen.

""Both Signal Plus Messenger and FlyGram are slightly different variants of BadBazaar that focus on user data exfiltration and espionage. However, it’s important to note that each of them possesses unique malicious functionalities,"" Stefanko said.

According to a report in The Financial Times, citing veteran YouTube staff, the short-video platform Shorts “risks cannibalising its core business”.

Google (NASDAQ: ) recently announced that Shorts now has more than 2 billion logged-in monthly users, giving it an edge over competitors like TikTok and Instagram Reels.

“Recent YouTube strategy meetings have discussed the risk that long-form videos, which produce more revenue for the company, are ‘dying out’ as a format,” the report mentioned late on Sunday.

YouTube staff feels that “content creators are making fewer long-form videos -- driven by a lack of consumer appetite and commissions from brands that favour short-form content for product placement”.

YouTube says Shorts was “designed to complement, not compete with, all the other formats creators use” on the platform, such as audio and livestreams.

YouTube’s ad revenue, though improved, had been on a downward year-over-year slide for three straight quarters.

The company is still figuring out how to earn more ad money from Shorts.

The latest YouTube Shorts usage is up from 1.5 billion monthly logged-in users for YouTube Shorts announced last year.

In its results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2022, Google reported that YouTube brought in $7.67 billion in advertising revenue.

This is 4 per cent higher than the same period last year.

The company introduced advertising on Shorts late last year.

YouTube now has to support Shorts as it gains immense popularity, like investing in creators and incentivising them to make exclusive content.

The company -- now part of the parent group called Alphabet and run by Indian-origin Sundar Pichai -- has diversified into several tech streams and launched several products.

The company rapidly grew to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud, Chrome, YouTube, Workspace, Android operating system, cloud storage Drive, Google Translate), video chat app Meet, Pixel smartphones, Google Assistant, Bard AI and more

The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004.

In June 2013, Google acquired Waze in a $966 million deal. Its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google's own mapping service.

In 2015, Google was reorganised as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet.

Pichai was appointed as CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.

Google is now part of the generative AI economy with its Bard models, which includes support for over 40 languages, including nine Indian languages.

The tech giant has also expanded Bard's access to more places, including Brazil and across Europe. Bard is now available in over 230 countries and territories.

Google is also launching new features to help users better customise their experience, boost their creativity and get more done, including the ability to add images in Prompts, listen to Bard's responses out loud, and easily adjust Bard's response to be longer, shorter.

In early May, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centres in the US. These centres will power up the company’s tools, including AI technology.

2022-08-31, IANS,Google-owned Fitbit face 3 data transfer complaints in EU,https://in.investing.com/news/googleowned-fitbit-face-3-data-transfer-complaints-in-eu-3791685,"London, Aug 31 (IANS) European privacy rights group, noyb, has filed three complaints with the data protection authorities (DPAs) in Austria, the Netherlands and Italy on behalf of three Fitbit users, alleging that the Google-owned company forces new users of its app to consent to data transfers outside the EU. noyb requested the Austrian, Dutch and Italian DPAs to order Fitbit to share all mandatory information about the transfers with its users and allow them to use its app without having to consent to the data transfers.

Based on Alphabet’s (Google’s parent company) turnover of last year, the competent authorities could also issue a fine of up to 11,28 billion euros, according to the complaint.

When creating an account with Fitbit, European users are obliged to “agree to the transfer of their data to the US and other countries with different data protection laws”.

This means that their data could end up in any country around the globe that does not have the same privacy protections as the EU.

""In other words, Fitbit forces its users to consent to sharing sensitive data without providing them with clear information about possible implications or the specific countries their data goes to,"" according to the noyb complaint.

This results in a consent that is neither free, informed or specific -- which means that the consent clearly doesn’t meet the GDPR’s requirements. The collected data can even be shared for processing with third-party companies of which we do not know where they are located. Furthermore, it is impossible for users to find out which specific data is affected, reads the complaint.

""First, you buy a Fitbit watch for at least 100 euros. Then you sign up for a paid subscription, only to find that you are forced to ‘freely’ agree to the sharing of your data with recipients around the world. Five years into the GDPR, Fitbit is still trying to enforce a ‘take it or leave it’ approach,” said Maartje de Graaf, Data Protection Lawyer at noyb.

Romain Robert, one of the complainants, said that “Fitbit may be a nice app to track your fitness, but once you want to learn more about how your data is being handled, you are bound for a marathon”.

""This week, we launched Search Labs in the first countries outside the US -- India and Japan -- enabling people to opt into SGE to help them better understand topics faster, uncover new viewpoints and insights and get things done more easily,"" Google said in a blogpost.

SGE, which was first announced at this year's Google I/O Developer conference in May, adds a conversational mode to Google Search, allowing you to ask Google questions about a topic and have it respond with answers, similar to an AI chatbot.

Similar to the US, people in India and Japan will be able to use generative AI capabilities in their local languages, either by typing a query or using voice input.

In India, users will also find a language toggle to help multilingual speakers easily switch back and forth between English and Hindi, and they can also listen to the responses, which is a popular preference. In both countries, Search ads will continue to appear in dedicated ad slots throughout the page, the tech giant said.

Along with these updates, SGE is introducing a new feature that will make it easier for people to discover and visit the web pages that support the information provided by AI.

""Starting today, when you see an arrow icon next to information in an AI-powered overview, you can click to see relevant web pages, and easily learn more by visiting the sites,"" Google said.

The feature is launching first in the US and will roll out to Japan and India over the coming weeks.

2022-08-30, Investing.com,"Private payrolls data ahead, Nvidia's record close - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/private-payrolls-data-ahead-nvidias-record-close--whats-moving-markets-3790321,"Investing.com -- Investors await the release of fresh labor market data after numbers on Tuesday showed that job openings in the U.S. fell to their lowest level in over two years in July. Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) close at a fresh record high as the semiconductor group and AI-darling announces a new partnership with Google (NASDAQ: ). Elsewhere, the price of shoots up following an appeals court ruling that could pave the way for the listing of an exchange-traded fund that tracks the popular cryptocurrency.

1. Futures edge lower ahead of fresh economic data

U.S. stock futures inched down on Wednesday, but stayed relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested weaker-than-anticipated job openings data and looked ahead to further labor market figures later in the week.

At 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT), the contract had dipped marginally by 4 points or 0.01%, were lower by 7 points or 0.1%, and fell by 37 points or 0.3%.

All three of the main indices ended the prior session higher after data showed that , a proxy for labor demand, in the U.S. dropped by more than anticipated to their lowest point in nearly two-and-a-half years in July. The rate of workers quitting their jobs also decreased to a 30-month low, suggesting that employees may be seeing fewer opportunities that would persuade them to switch roles.

Meanwhile, a Conference Board index reading of 106.1 missed estimates, pointing to a possible easing in the broader economy.

The numbers helped to bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve, which has been keen to slow labor demand to help cool inflation, will elect to keep interest rates steady at their next policy meeting in September.

2. Private payrolls loom amid wave of labor market data

More detail will likely be plugged into the current picture of the labor market later today with the release of data for August.

The ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report is projected to show that private employment rose by 195,000 during the month, down from a jump of 324,000 in July. The wave of job market data is due to roll on tomorrow when for unemployment benefits are unveiled.

The figures will add to the backdrop for this week's main event on the economic calendar: the monthly . Economists predict that the U.S. economy added 170,000 jobs in August, a smaller increase compared to an uptick of 187,000 in the previous month.

Taken together, the data are expected to aid efforts to forecast the Fed's interest rate path. There is currently an 88% probability that the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% next month, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

On the earnings front, Jack Daniel's whiskey owner Brown-Forman (NYSE: ), as well as tech firms Salesforce (NYSE: ) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ: ), are scheduled to report their latest quarterly reports on Wednesday.

3. Nvidia's record close

Shares in Nvidia soared to their highest-ever closing price on Tuesday, bringing the chipmaking giant's market capitalization up to $1.2 trillion.

The California company has become the focal point of a recent surge in enthusiasm around the applications of generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia almost exclusively creates the chips that power the technology, giving it pole position in the race to take advantage of the AI boom.

Shares, which have more than tripled in 2022, were given even more of a boost in the prior session after Nvidia announced a new partnership with Google. The agreement will give the tech titan's clients more access to Nvidia's powerful H100 graphics processing units.

Nvidia has now accounted for just under a sixth of the 's returns this year, according to Reuters, making it the standout performer in what has been a strong annual rally across megacap tech stocks.

4. Bitcoin jumps after Grayscale appeals court win

The price of Bitcoin surged to a two-week high after a landmark decision by an appeals court in the U.S. set the stage for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

On Tuesday, the court's panel of judges ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to deny crypto asset manager Grayscale permission to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF that would track the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The court said Grayscale proved that its proposed Bitcoin ETF was ""materially similar"" to a separate futures ETF that follows agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a pre-determined price. The SEC has approved the Bitcoin futures ETF.

Bitcoin spiked after the move, and has risen by 5.54% to $27,407.5 over the past 24 hours as of 05:43 ET on Wednesday. Other major cap coins, including Ether, also climbed, while crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) closed nearly 15% higher on Tuesday.

Both the cryptocurrency and asset management industries have long been attempting to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, arguing that it would grant investors exposure to Bitcoin without necessarily having to own the digital token. The SEC, however, has flagged that these types of ETFs could be subjected to manipulation.

Several other parties have also applied for a spot bitcoin ETF this year, including Inc and BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ), the world’s biggest asset manager. A bulk of these filings proposed working with Coinbase to police bitcoin trading and prevent price manipulation.

5. Crude rises following U.S. inventories draw

Oil prices rose on Wednesday, extending recent gains after industry data pointed to a hefty draw in stockpiles, adding to concerns about a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 05:16 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $81.69 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.5% to $85.31. Both contracts rose over 1% on Tuesday.

Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed that crude stocks fell by over 11 million barrels last week, suggesting healthy demand ahead of the Labor Day holiday that usually marks peak summer demand.

Additionally, Hurricane Idalia continues to head towards Florida, threatening production in the Gulf of Mexico. The region makes up about 15% of U.S. oil output and about 5% of production, according to data from the Energy Information Administration cited by Reuters. Oil group Chevron (NYSE: ) said it had evacuated some staff from three platforms, although it noted that output was continuing. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure firm Kinder Morgan (NYSE: ) said it planned to shut a petroleum pipeline."

2022-08-29, Investing.com,General Motors Partners with Google Cloud on AI Initiatives,https://in.investing.com/news/general-motors-partners-with-google-cloud-on-ai-initiatives-432SI-3788978,"General Motors (NYSE: ) and Google Cloud (NASDAQ: ) today shared new details on how the two companies collaborated to bring conversational AI technology into millions of GM vehicles, helping drivers in a variety of ways. Since its launch in 2022, GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant (IVA) has been powered by advanced, intent-recognition algorithms that use Google Cloud's conversational AI technologies, providing OnStar Members with responses to common inquiries, as well as routing and navigation assistance. The successful deployment of Google Cloud's AI in GM's OnStar service has now opened the door to future generative AI deployments being jointly piloted by GM and Google Cloud.

""Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the buying, ownership, and interaction experience inside the vehicle and beyond, enabling more opportunities to deliver new features and services,"" said Mike Abbott , executive vice president, Software and Services, GM. ""Our software-led approach has accelerated the creation of compelling services for our customers while driving increased efficiency across the GM enterprise. The work with Google Cloud is another example of our efforts to transform how customers engage with our products and services.""

GM's decision to collaborate with Google Cloud in exploring new, business-wide generative AI applications builds on a journey the two companies began together in 2019 when GM named its first vehicles with Google built-in. Since then, the number of GM vehicles with Google built-in has grown, giving customers easy access to Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play, directly from their vehicles' center displays. That collaboration soon expanded to the deployment of Google Cloud's conversational AI technology, Dialogflow. With this technology, GM's OnStar virtual assistant is now handling more than 1 million customer inquiries a month in the U.S. and Canada , and is available in most model year 2015 and newer GM vehicles connected by OnStar.

""General Motors is at the forefront of deploying AI in practical and effective ways that ultimately create better customer experiences,"" said Thomas Kurian , CEO, Google Cloud. ""We're looking forward to a deepened relationship and more collaboration with GM as we explore how the company uses generative AI in transformational ways.""

GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant (IVA), which launched in 2022, uses advanced AI-based, intent-recognition technologies powered by the Google Cloud's Dialogflow technology to provide OnStar Members with routing and navigation assistance, including turn-by-turn directions. The OnStar IVA assists with common inquiries initiated by the non–emergency OnStar blue button push in GM vehicles, but also endeavors to distinguish phrases and words that may signify an emergency situation and help to quickly route the call to OnStar's specially trained emergency Advisors.

With this technology, OnStar has been better able to immediately understand a customer's question or request the first time it is spoken, providing a response with a modern, natural sounding voice. Customers hear the same familiar OnStar ""voice"" whether they are sitting in their vehicles or calling on the phone, and have reacted positively to experiences on calls without hold times. With the OnStar IVA successfully helping GM customers requesting navigation assistance, OnStar Advisors have been able to spend more time with customers with requests that require a human touch.

Additionally, GM is leveraging Google Cloud's Dialogflow technology to deploy chatbots that can conversationally help answer customer questions about GM vehicles and product features based on the technical information from GM's extensive vehicle data repositories. With this technology, customers can get quick answers to questions like, ""Tell me more about GM's 2024 EV lineup,"" or learn how to take advantage of new technology features in their vehicle. These chatbots are active across GM's corporate and vehicle brand websites, bringing additional convenience to customers looking for specific vehicle related information."

This new study was first spotted by The Verge.

""Google has one of the most balanced or consistent pay bands among Big Tech companies. This means it's rare for someone at a lower job level to get paid more than someone at a higher level,"" the study said.

""Meta engineers appear to level up the fastest and have some of the highest pay,"" it added.

The data is based on compensation packages self-reported by Blind users from January of last year to this month.

Moreover, the study showed that Amazon’s promotions can take longer than its peers, and its pay ranges for engineers are the widest.

In addition, Microsoft has several job levels for software engineers, which may allow the company to give out more promotions.

""Microsoft has many job levels for software engineers, which might give the company more flexibility to hand out more promotions. However, their total compensation is lower than their peers across the board up until staff software engineer,"" the study stated.

Facebook has already launched a new Feeds tab globally that follows this chronological format.

This move by Meta (Facebook's parent company) shows compliance with the DSA’s requirement to give users the choice of viewing non-personalised content.

Notably, there are no ""Suggested For You"" posts in the new chronological Facebook news feed.

Moreover, the report said that YouTube has also made changes to accommodate user preferences.

Users who have turned off the ""watch history"" feature will no longer receive video recommendations based on previous viewing.

The new law, driven by the DSA, applies to all users, not just those in the EU, the report mentioned.

By allowing users to disable profiling-based recommendations for content, platforms are challenged to engage users within their closed ecosystems. Platforms like these curate personalized content based on users' habits and interests.

With the DSA, users will be empowered to control their online experience and address this information asymmetry.

Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ: ) has said it will increase how much information it provides about ads targeted at users in the European Union (EU), as the new set of regulations known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) comes into force on August 25.

Google will also expand data access to third-party researchers studying systemic content risks in the region.

“We are also making changes to provide new kinds of visibility into our content moderation decisions and give users different ways to contact us. And we are updating our reporting and appeals processes to provide specified types of information and context about our decisions,” said the tech giant.

The joint statement, issued at a time when generative AI poses new challenges to people’s data, has been sent directly to Alphabet (YouTube), ByteDance (TikTok), Meta Platforms (Instagram, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Threads), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) (LinkedIn), Sina Corp (Weibo), and X Corp (X, previously Twitter).

The statement, singed by the key privacy regulators from the UK, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand, Colombia, Jersey, Morocco, Argentina and Mexico, urged social media platforms to protect users’ public posts from scraping, saying that mass data scraping incidents that harvest personal information can constitute reportable data breaches in many jurisdictions.

Scraped personal information can be exploited for various purposes, such as monetisation through re-use on third-party websites, sale to malicious actors, or private analysis or intelligence gathering, resulting in serious risks to individuals.

“In most jurisdictions, personal information that is ‘publicly available’, ‘publicly accessible’ or ‘of a public nature’ on the internet, is subject to data protection and privacy laws,” they wrote.

Social media companies and the operators of other websites that host publicly accessible personal information also have data protection obligations with respect to third-party scraping from their sites.

“SMCs and other websites are responsible for protecting individuals’ personal information from unlawful data scraping,” the privacy regulators added.

As no one safeguard will adequately protect against all potential privacy harms associated with data scraping, SMCs and other websites should implement multi-layered technical and procedural controls to mitigate the risks, they advised.

The regulators said they welcome any feedback from SMCs in the next one month, demonstrating how they comply with the expectations outlined in this joint statement.

Meanwhile, shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) close at a fresh record high as the semiconductor group and AI-darling announces a new partnership with Google (NASDAQ: ). Elsewhere, the price of shoots up following an appeals court ruling that could pave the way for the listing of an exchange-traded fund that tracks the popular cryptocurrency.

1. Futures edge lower ahead of fresh economic data

U.S. stock futures inched down on Wednesday, but stayed relatively close to the flatline, as investors digested weaker-than-anticipated job openings data and looked ahead to further labor market figures later in the week.

At 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT), the contract had dipped marginally by 4 points or 0.01%, were lower by 7 points or 0.1%, and fell by 37 points or 0.3%.

All three of the main indices ended the prior session higher after data showed that , a proxy for labor demand, in the U.S. dropped by more than anticipated to their lowest point in nearly two-and-a-half years in July. The rate of workers quitting their jobs also decreased to a 30-month low, suggesting that employees may be seeing fewer opportunities that would persuade them to switch roles.

Meanwhile, a Conference Board index reading of 106.1 missed estimates, pointing to a possible easing in the broader economy.

The numbers helped to bolster expectations that the Federal Reserve, which has been keen to slow labor demand to help cool inflation, will elect to keep interest rates steady at their next policy meeting in September.

2. Private payrolls loom amid wave of labor market data

More detail will likely be plugged into the current picture of the labor market later today with the release of data for August.

The ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment report is projected to show that private employment rose by 195,000 during the month, down from a jump of 324,000 in July. The wave of job market data is due to roll on tomorrow when for unemployment benefits are unveiled.

The figures will add to the backdrop for this week's main event on the economic calendar: the monthly . Economists predict that the U.S. economy added 170,000 jobs in August, a smaller increase compared to an uptick of 187,000 in the previous month.

Taken together, the data are expected to aid efforts to forecast the Fed's interest rate path. There is currently an 88% probability that the central bank will keep borrowing costs unchanged at a range of 5.25% to 5.50% next month, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool .

On the earnings front, Jack Daniel's whiskey owner Brown-Forman (NYSE: ), as well as tech firms Salesforce (NYSE: ) and Crowdstrike (NASDAQ: ), are scheduled to report their latest quarterly reports on Wednesday.

3. Nvidia's record close

Shares in Nvidia soared to their highest-ever closing price on Tuesday, bringing the chipmaking giant's market capitalization up to $1.2 trillion.

The California company has become the focal point of a recent surge in enthusiasm around the applications of generative artificial intelligence. Nvidia almost exclusively creates the chips that power the technology, giving it pole position in the race to take advantage of the AI boom.

Shares, which have more than tripled in 2022, were given even more of a boost in the prior session after Nvidia announced a new partnership with Google. The agreement will give the tech titan's clients more access to Nvidia's powerful H100 graphics processing units.

Nvidia has now accounted for just under a sixth of the 's returns this year, according to Reuters, making it the standout performer in what has been a strong annual rally across megacap tech stocks.

4. Bitcoin jumps after Grayscale appeals court win

The price of Bitcoin surged to a two-week high after a landmark decision by an appeals court in the U.S. set the stage for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

On Tuesday, the court's panel of judges ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission was wrong to deny crypto asset manager Grayscale permission to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF that would track the price of the world's largest cryptocurrency. The court said Grayscale proved that its proposed Bitcoin ETF was ""materially similar"" to a separate futures ETF that follows agreements to buy or sell Bitcoin at a pre-determined price. The SEC has approved the Bitcoin futures ETF.

Bitcoin spiked after the move, and has risen by 5.54% to $27,407.5 over the past 24 hours as of 05:43 ET on Wednesday. Other major cap coins, including Ether, also climbed, while crypto exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) closed nearly 15% higher on Tuesday.

Both the cryptocurrency and asset management industries have long been attempting to create a spot Bitcoin ETF, arguing that it would grant investors exposure to Bitcoin without necessarily having to own the digital token. The SEC, however, has flagged that these types of ETFs could be subjected to manipulation.

Several other parties have also applied for a spot bitcoin ETF this year, including Inc and BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ), the world’s biggest asset manager. A bulk of these filings proposed working with Coinbase to police bitcoin trading and prevent price manipulation.

5. Crude rises following U.S. inventories draw

Oil prices rose on Wednesday, extending recent gains after industry data pointed to a hefty draw in stockpiles, adding to concerns about a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.

By 05:16 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $81.69 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.5% to $85.31. Both contracts rose over 1% on Tuesday.

Data from the American Petroleum Institute, released late Tuesday, showed that crude stocks fell by over 11 million barrels last week, suggesting healthy demand ahead of the Labor Day holiday that usually marks peak summer demand.

Additionally, Hurricane Idalia continues to head towards Florida, threatening production in the Gulf of Mexico. The region makes up about 15% of U.S. oil output and about 5% of production, according to data from the Energy Information Administration cited by Reuters. Oil group Chevron (NYSE: ) said it had evacuated some staff from three platforms, although it noted that output was continuing. Meanwhile, energy infrastructure firm Kinder Morgan (NYSE: ) said it planned to shut a petroleum pipeline."

2022-08-29, Investing.com,General Motors Partners with Google Cloud on AI Initiatives,https://in.investing.com/news/general-motors-partners-with-google-cloud-on-ai-initiatives-432SI-3788978,"General Motors (NYSE: ) and Google Cloud (NASDAQ: ) today shared new details on how the two companies collaborated to bring conversational AI technology into millions of GM vehicles, helping drivers in a variety of ways. Since its launch in 2022, GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant (IVA) has been powered by advanced, intent-recognition algorithms that use Google Cloud's conversational AI technologies, providing OnStar Members with responses to common inquiries, as well as routing and navigation assistance. The successful deployment of Google Cloud's AI in GM's OnStar service has now opened the door to future generative AI deployments being jointly piloted by GM and Google Cloud.

""Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the buying, ownership, and interaction experience inside the vehicle and beyond, enabling more opportunities to deliver new features and services,"" said Mike Abbott , executive vice president, Software and Services, GM. ""Our software-led approach has accelerated the creation of compelling services for our customers while driving increased efficiency across the GM enterprise. The work with Google Cloud is another example of our efforts to transform how customers engage with our products and services.""

GM's decision to collaborate with Google Cloud in exploring new, business-wide generative AI applications builds on a journey the two companies began together in 2019 when GM named its first vehicles with Google built-in. Since then, the number of GM vehicles with Google built-in has grown, giving customers easy access to Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play, directly from their vehicles' center displays. That collaboration soon expanded to the deployment of Google Cloud's conversational AI technology, Dialogflow. With this technology, GM's OnStar virtual assistant is now handling more than 1 million customer inquiries a month in the U.S. and Canada , and is available in most model year 2015 and newer GM vehicles connected by OnStar.

""General Motors is at the forefront of deploying AI in practical and effective ways that ultimately create better customer experiences,"" said Thomas Kurian , CEO, Google Cloud. ""We're looking forward to a deepened relationship and more collaboration with GM as we explore how the company uses generative AI in transformational ways.""

GM's OnStar Interactive Virtual Assistant (IVA), which launched in 2022, uses advanced AI-based, intent-recognition technologies powered by the Google Cloud's Dialogflow technology to provide OnStar Members with routing and navigation assistance, including turn-by-turn directions. The OnStar IVA assists with common inquiries initiated by the non–emergency OnStar blue button push in GM vehicles, but also endeavors to distinguish phrases and words that may signify an emergency situation and help to quickly route the call to OnStar's specially trained emergency Advisors.

With this technology, OnStar has been better able to immediately understand a customer's question or request the first time it is spoken, providing a response with a modern, natural sounding voice. Customers hear the same familiar OnStar ""voice"" whether they are sitting in their vehicles or calling on the phone, and have reacted positively to experiences on calls without hold times. With the OnStar IVA successfully helping GM customers requesting navigation assistance, OnStar Advisors have been able to spend more time with customers with requests that require a human touch.

Additionally, GM is leveraging Google Cloud's Dialogflow technology to deploy chatbots that can conversationally help answer customer questions about GM vehicles and product features based on the technical information from GM's extensive vehicle data repositories. With this technology, customers can get quick answers to questions like, ""Tell me more about GM's 2024 EV lineup,"" or learn how to take advantage of new technology features in their vehicle. These chatbots are active across GM's corporate and vehicle brand websites, bringing additional convenience to customers looking for specific vehicle related information."

This new study was first spotted by The Verge.

""Google has one of the most balanced or consistent pay bands among Big Tech companies. This means it's rare for someone at a lower job level to get paid more than someone at a higher level,"" the study said.

""Meta engineers appear to level up the fastest and have some of the highest pay,"" it added.

The data is based on compensation packages self-reported by Blind users from January of last year to this month.

Moreover, the study showed that Amazon’s promotions can take longer than its peers, and its pay ranges for engineers are the widest.

In addition, Microsoft has several job levels for software engineers, which may allow the company to give out more promotions.

""Microsoft has many job levels for software engineers, which might give the company more flexibility to hand out more promotions. However, their total compensation is lower than their peers across the board up until staff software engineer,"" the study stated.

Recently, a Google software engineer in his 20s has said that he works for only an hour a day and earns a salary of $150,000 (about Rs 1.2 crore) yearly.

Devon explained that he starts his week by writing code for ""a decent part"" of any given task before sending it off to his manager.

He had interned at Google and knew that if he got the job, he would not have to work very hard.

As per X (formerly Twitter) user Leopeva64, the feature can be found in Chrome Canary, Google’s bleeding edge version of Chrome, reports The Verge.

""Chrome for desktop will also have the option to ""read aloud"" articles, the initial implementation of this feature (in the Canary version) is pretty basic but it works, in this link you can see a video with the feature in action,"" Leopeva64 wrote in its post.

If they have the feature, users can have Google read the text by clicking a play button at the top of an article in reading mode. The X user also shared a link to a video showing off the feature on Reddit.

Based on the video, the report said that the tech giant still has some work to do here, as the voice is robotic and it spells out a header that reads ""summary"" instead of just reading the word.

Meanwhile, Google's AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE) is getting a major new feature, which will summarise articles for users while reading on the web.

Currently, the feature -- ""SGE while browsing"" is in the experiment phase.

2022-08-25, IANS,New EU law lets social media users opt out of AI-driven personalised feeds,https://in.investing.com/news/new-eu-law-lets-social-media-users-opt-out-of-aidriven-personalised-feeds-3785319,"London, Aug 25 (IANS) Social media users in the European Union (EU) can now opt out of AI-driven personalised content feeds on mainstream social networks.The change is the result of the EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), which allows users on platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat to decline “personalised” content feeds based on “relevance” (i.e. tracking) and allows them to choose a more traditional news feed that displays posts from friends in chronological order, reports TechCrunch on Friday.

Facebook has already launched a new Feeds tab globally that follows this chronological format.

This move by Meta (Facebook's parent company) shows compliance with the DSA’s requirement to give users the choice of viewing non-personalised content.

Notably, there are no ""Suggested For You"" posts in the new chronological Facebook news feed.

Moreover, the report said that YouTube has also made changes to accommodate user preferences.

Users who have turned off the ""watch history"" feature will no longer receive video recommendations based on previous viewing.

The new law, driven by the DSA, applies to all users, not just those in the EU, the report mentioned.

By allowing users to disable profiling-based recommendations for content, platforms are challenged to engage users within their closed ecosystems. Platforms like these curate personalized content based on users' habits and interests.

With the DSA, users will be empowered to control their online experience and address this information asymmetry.

Meanwhile, Google (NASDAQ: ) has said it will increase how much information it provides about ads targeted at users in the European Union (EU), as the new set of regulations known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) comes into force on August 25.

Google will also expand data access to third-party researchers studying systemic content risks in the region.

“We are also making changes to provide new kinds of visibility into our content moderation decisions and give users different ways to contact us. And we are updating our reporting and appeals processes to provide specified types of information and context about our decisions,” said the tech giant.

If allowed by their admin, users will be able to install Google Chat apps using the “New chat” button in Chat.

The new app is available for all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts.

On Wednesday, Google had introduced a new feature that allows Chat space members to see view counts for messages in all spaces.

The view counts in spaces will only be available for messages sent on August 1, 2022 and beyond.

Last month, the tech giant had introduced a new media viewer for Chat on Android devices, which improved the media browsing experience.

The company had also added a shared media option that allows users to quickly browse through all media shared in a Chat conversation, which is accessible from the conversation as well as from the full-screen view of every media item.

In June, the company had rolled out a smart compose feature in the communication service on web.

This machine-learning powered feature suggests relevant contextual phrases as users type, saves their time by cutting back on repetitive writing, and also reduces spelling and grammatical errors.

The joint statement, issued at a time when generative AI poses new challenges to people’s data, has been sent directly to Alphabet (YouTube), ByteDance (TikTok), Meta Platforms (Instagram, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Threads), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) (LinkedIn), Sina Corp (Weibo), and X Corp (X, previously Twitter).

The statement, singed by the key privacy regulators from the UK, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand, Colombia, Jersey, Morocco, Argentina and Mexico, urged social media platforms to protect users’ public posts from scraping, saying that mass data scraping incidents that harvest personal information can constitute reportable data breaches in many jurisdictions.

Scraped personal information can be exploited for various purposes, such as monetisation through re-use on third-party websites, sale to malicious actors, or private analysis or intelligence gathering, resulting in serious risks to individuals.

“In most jurisdictions, personal information that is ‘publicly available’, ‘publicly accessible’ or ‘of a public nature’ on the internet, is subject to data protection and privacy laws,” they wrote.

Social media companies and the operators of other websites that host publicly accessible personal information also have data protection obligations with respect to third-party scraping from their sites.

“SMCs and other websites are responsible for protecting individuals’ personal information from unlawful data scraping,” the privacy regulators added.

As no one safeguard will adequately protect against all potential privacy harms associated with data scraping, SMCs and other websites should implement multi-layered technical and procedural controls to mitigate the risks, they advised.

The regulators said they welcome any feedback from SMCs in the next one month, demonstrating how they comply with the expectations outlined in this joint statement.

This ""basically guarantees"" smooth sailing for the rest of the week.

About 97 per cent of Google employees call the company a great place to work as compared to 57 per cent of workers of a typical US company, according to the report.

It's an essential feature because, as of right now, there isn't a native way to transfer an eSIM between Android devices, leaving the process entirely up to the carriers.

The feature will prompt users to scan a QR code to start the transfer process.

""Seeing as most of this functionality is not yet live, we were only able to access this beginning portion, with @AssembleDebug also having been able to uncover a Fast Pair-like UI that appears before scanning the QR code,"" the report said.

For comparison, Apple (NASDAQ: ) has simplified the eSIM transfer process for iPhones by creating a tool within iOS that allows easy wireless transfer of eSIM between iPhones.

Last month, Google had released the Android 14 Beta 4 update which included an 'auto-confirm unlock' feature, a variety of fixes, system performance improvements, and much more.

According to Android researcher Mishaal Rahman, the 'auto-confirm' feature unlocks the users' phone automatically when they enter the PIN correctly.

However, the PIN must be 6 digits or more to enable this.

Rahman had also said that the update included new default profile picture options.

Also, as per the Android researcher, users can see their phone’s manufactured year under Settings > About phone > Model,

""The 'ring volume' and 'notification volume' sliders are now completely separated in Android 14, with no way to merge them again. In older betas, the separation was controlled by a DeviceConfig flag, but that flag’s no longer in use,"" he had added.

2022-08-21, Investing.com,California DMV probes GM’s Cruise robotaxi following crash,https://in.investing.com/news/california-dmv-probes-gms-cruise-robotaxi-following-crash-432SI-3779267,"The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) announced Friday that the state auto regulator has opened an investigation into “recent concerning incidents” surrounding General Motors' (NYSE: ) Cruise autonomous vehicle unit. The DMV has also asked that GM remove half of their robotaxis from service while the investigation is underway.

The statement from the California DMV follows an incident involving a Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle in San Francisco late on Thursday, the latest accident involving the self-driving cars.

""The DMV reserves the right, following investigation of the facts, to suspend or revoke testing and/or deployment permits"" if it is determined to be an unreasonable risk to public safety, the regulator said in a statement.

According to a statement by Cruise, one of its taxis ""entered the intersection on a green light and was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene"" after 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT) on Thursday.

The car ""did identify the risk of a collision and initiated a braking maneuver, reducing its speed, but was ultimately unable to avoid the collision,"" the company added Friday.

According to a statement by the San Francisco Police Department, the collision took place while a fire truck was in emergency operation mode, utilizing its front-facing red lights and siren. The police also noted that the only occupant of the self-driving vehicle involved was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of injuries that were determined to be non-life-threatening.

Despite facing resistance from residents and city entities, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently granted permission for Cruise and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) Waymo to run robotaxis in San Francisco around the clock and to impose fares on passengers. Previously, the companies had conducted robotaxi trials that were confined by specific timeframes and geographical zones within the city.

City Attorney David Chiu has urged the CPUC to pause its decision as the city intends to seek a re-hearing.

""We have seen that this technology is not yet ready, and poor AV performance has interfered with the life-saving operations of first responders. San Francisco will suffer serious harms from this unfettered expansion,"" said David Chiu.

Shares of GM are up 0.18% in mid-day trading Monday."
2022-08-21, Investing.com,"YouTube : AI is here, and we will embrace it responsibly together with our music partners",https://in.investing.com/news/youtube--ai-is-here-and-we-will-embrace-it-responsibly-together-with-our-music-partners-432SI-3779031,"YouTube (GOOGL) announced:

AI is here, and we will embrace it responsibly together with our music partners.

Today, ​​AI is moving at a pace faster than ever before. It’s empowering creativity, sparking new ideas, and even transforming industries. At this critical inflection point, it’s clear that we need to boldly embrace this technology with a continued commitment to responsibility. With that in mind, over the past few months I’ve spent time talking with AI experts working across YouTube as well as leaders in one of the most influential and creative forces in the world: the music industry.

For nearly our entire history, YouTube and music have been inextricably linked. As a hosting platform, YouTube connected fans worldwide and quickly became home for iconic music videos and breakout artists. Our deep partnership with the music industry has enabled us to innovate and evolve together — building products, features and experiences, from our YouTube Music and Premium subscription services, to global livestreaming capabilities, that spur originality and bring communities of fans even closer together. And core to our shared success has been the protection of these creative works and copyrights of artists.

Now, we’re working closely with our music partners, including Universal Music Group, to develop an AI framework to help us work toward our common goals. These three fundamental AI principles serve to enhance music’s unique creative expression while also protecting music artists and the integrity of their work.

In 2022 alone, there have been more than 1.7 billion views of videos related to generative AI tools on YouTube.

Principle #1: AI is here, and we will embrace it responsibly together with our music partners.

Advancements in generative AI are no longer a future promise. Millions of people already embrace it in their day-to-day lives, from finding useful information to increasing creativity and productivity. And YouTube creators in particular have embraced AI to streamline and boost their creative processes. In 2022 alone, there have been more than 1.7 billion views of videos related to AI tools on YouTube.

As generative AI unlocks ambitious new forms of creativity, YouTube and our partners across the music industry agree to build on our long collaborative history and responsibly embrace this rapidly advancing field. Our goal is to partner with the music industry to empower creativity in a way that enhances our joint pursuit of responsible innovation.

To that end, we are addressing this opportunity head on. Today, we’re introducing YouTube’s Music AI Incubator. The incubator will help inform YouTube’s approach as we work with some of music's most innovative artists, songwriters, and producers across the industry, across a diverse range of culture, genres, and experience.

To kick off the program, we’re working with Universal Music Group - a leader in the space - and their incredible roster of talent.

To kick off the program, we’re working with Universal Music Group - a leader in the space - and their incredible roster of talent. This includes global superstar Anitta, internationally renowned and revered songwriter, producer and entrepreneur Björn Ulvaeus, innovative genre-defying artist d4vd, acclaimed musician, composer and producer Don Was, Columbian sensation Juanes, hitmaking producer Louis Bell, visionary composer Max Richter, influential songwriter and producer Rodney Jerkins, iconic singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash, 3x Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer, Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, acclaimed rapper, multi platinum musician, entrepreneur and philanthropist Yo Gotti, and the estate of American musical icon Frank Sinatra, amongst others. This talented group will help gather insights on generative AI experiments and research that are being developed at YouTube. We’re also excited to welcome our partners across the industry into the program as we move forward. Working together, we will better understand how these technologies can be most valuable for artists and fans, how they can enhance creativity, and where we can seek to solve critical issues for the future.

Principle #2: AI is ushering in a new age of creative expression, but it must include appropriate protections and unlock opportunities for music partners who decide to participate.

We’re continuing our strong track record of protecting the creative work of artists on YouTube. We’ve made massive investments over the years in the systems that help balance the interests of copyright holders with those of the creative community on YouTube.

Content ID, our best-in-class rights management technology, ensures rights holders get paid for use of their content and has generated billions for the industry over the years. A new era of generated content is here, and it gives us an opportunity to reimagine and evolve again. We’re eager to further build on our focus of helping artists and creators make money on YouTube and will continue to do so in collaboration with our partners.

We’ll continue to invest in the AI-powered technology that helps us protect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters – from Content ID, to policies and detection and enforcement systems that keep our platform safe behind the scenes.

Principle #3: We've built an industry-leading trust and safety organization and content policies. We will scale those to meet the challenges of AI.

We spent years investing in the policies and trust and safety teams that help protect the YouTube community, and we’re also applying these safeguards to AI-generated content. One example is our policies prohibiting certain technically manipulated content. That means on YouTube, you can’t upload a video that’s been technically manipulated to promote false claims or mislead viewers about an atrocity in a way that could lead to serious risk of harm. And we will continue to iterate and evolve to meet new challenges.

But now, the limitless potential of generative AI demands a thoughtful approach that maps to the expansive boundaries of creative expression. Generative AI systems may amplify current challenges like trademark and copyright abuse, misinformation, spam, and more. But AI can also be used to identify this sort of content, and we’ll continue to invest in the AI-powered technology that helps us protect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters – from Content ID, to policies and detection and enforcement systems that keep our platform safe behind the scenes. And we commit to scaling this work even further.

More like this

In the months ahead, we’ll share more about specific technologies, monetization opportunities, and policies we’re developing. And we’ll continue to talk with additional partners about how to broaden our efforts.

I’m incredibly excited about the opportunity of AI to supercharge creativity around the world, but recognize that YouTube and the promise of AI will only be successful if our partners are successful. Together, we can embrace this new technology in a way that supports artists, songwriters, producers, and the industry as a whole while driving value for fans and pushing the bounds of what’s creatively possible.

The principles in our framework – embracing AI, granting protections while unlocking opportunity, and investing in our trust and safety work – provide a strong foundation for YouTube and the music industry to better navigate the world ahead."

Capturing the excitement of Indians in South Africa, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in the country for BRICS Summit, shared pictures of community members meeting him and celebrating.

""Feeling the fervour all the way from Johannesburg for Chandrayaan-3! The enthusiasm of our diaspora in South Africa for India's achievements in the space sector is truly gladdening,"" PM Modi posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday.

Taking to X, member of the House of Lords of the UK Parliament, Lord Rami Ranger, said, ""Indians are literally over the moon with the smooth landing of the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft! Congratulations ISRO. India becomes the only nation to land on the South Pole of the Moon.""

The success of the moon mission was of prime importance to India, which has now become the fourth country to master the soft-landing technology on the lunar surface after the US, China and the erstwhile Soviet Union.

Via this mission, India will understand the lunar surface better but also its potential for human habitation in the future.

""We’re extending these protections to sensitive actions taken in Gmail,"" the company said in a Workspace Updates blogpost on Wednesday.

The sensitive actions include creating a new filter, editing an existing filter, importing filters, adding a new forwarding address from the

Forwarding and POP/IMAP settings, and enabling the IMAP access status from the settings.

When these actions are taken, the tech giant will evaluate the session attempting the action, and if it’s deemed risky, it will be challenged with

a “Verify it’s you” prompt.

With a second and trusted factor, such as a 2-step verification code, users will be able to confirm the validity of the action.

Also, if a verification challenge fails or is not completed, users will receive a “Critical security alert” notification on trusted devices.

""Note that this feature only supports users that use Google as their identity provider and actions taken within Google products. SAML users are

not supported at this time,"" the tech giant explained.

Earlier this month, the company had introduced a native translation integration within the Gmail mobile app that enables users to seamlessly

communicate in a wide range of languages.

To translate messages on mobile, users have to select “Translate” on the dismissible banner and choose their preferred language.

The dismissible banner appears when the content language of a message is different from the “Google.com Mail display language” in users' account settings.

Also, users can choose to have Gmail always translate or never translate

specific languages.

Congratulations to @isro for the successful landing of #Chandrayaan3 on the moon,” he said in a post on X.com.

“Today India became the first country to successfully achieve a soft landing on the southern polar region of the moon,” he added.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) established a communication link with its moon lander that is now on the lunar soil.

“The communication link is established between the Chandrayaan-3 Lander and MOX-ISTRAC, Bengaluru,” ISRO said.

The Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft comprises a propulsion module (weighing 2,148 kg), a lander (1,723.89 kg) and a rover (26 kg).

Earlier, ISRO had said the moon lander had established communication links with the Chandrayaan-2 mission’s orbiter that is circling the moon since 2019.

In other words, the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter will be the backup communication channel for ISRO with the lander.

The mission life of the lander and the rover is 1 Lunar day or 14 Earth days, ISRO said.

The Chandrayaan-3 was put into orbit on July 14 in a copybook style by India's heavy lift rocket LVM3.

The spacecraft completed orbiting around the Earth and headed towards the moon on August 1.

The Google techie, identified as Devon, has shared his daily routine, in which he typically gets out of bed around 9 a.m., showers and cooks breakfast, and then works for Google until 11 a.m. or noon.

He then works on his startup for the rest of the day, reports Insider.

The news was first reported by Fortune.

He also stated that he couldn't justify working hard when he saw colleagues working late nights and not progressing up the corporate ladder.

Devon explained that he starts his week by writing code for ""a decent part"" of any given task before sending it off to his manager.

This ""basically guarantees"" smooth sailing for the rest of the week.

About 97 per cent of Google employees call the company a great place to work as compared to 57 per cent of workers of a typical US company, according to the report.

Google is well-known for a variety of perks, including a quirky campus, free meals, and competitive pay.

Devon had interned at Google and knew that if he got the job, he would not have to work very hard.

Plus, he was not so much slacking off as he was carefully understating how quickly he worked.

He further said that during his internship, he finished all of the code early on, allowing him to eke out a week-long trip to Hawaii.

""If I wanted to work long hours, I'd be at a startup. Most people choose Google because of the work-life balance and benefits. You could work at Apple (NASDAQ: ), but Apple has such fan appeal to software engineers. They work long hours… but at Google, most people know what they're doing is a job,"" Devon was quoted as saying.

According to Devon, he is among the thousands of software engineers who, by their own admission, are paid to do nothing.

The video-sharing platform also announced that it is testing bundling multiple uploads from a single creator within a short amount of time into a shelf in the Subscriptions feed.

This feature aims to make it easier for viewers to find the content they are looking for, and to put less pressure on creators to upload multiple times a day.

With this feature, the company also wants to ""make it simpler for viewers to engage with the content in the shelf and/or navigate to other content while scrolling in their feed.""

Earlier this month, the platform had announced that it started testing artificial intelligence (AI) auto-generated summaries.

It's an essential feature because, as of right now, there isn't a native way to transfer an eSIM between Android devices, leaving the process entirely up to the carriers.

The feature will prompt users to scan a QR code to start the transfer process.

""Seeing as most of this functionality is not yet live, we were only able to access this beginning portion, with @AssembleDebug also having been able to uncover a Fast Pair-like UI that appears before scanning the QR code,"" the report said.

The DMV has also asked that GM remove half of their robotaxis from service while the investigation is underway.

The statement from the California DMV follows an incident involving a Cruise robotaxi and an emergency vehicle in San Francisco late on Thursday, the latest accident involving the self-driving cars.

""The DMV reserves the right, following investigation of the facts, to suspend or revoke testing and/or deployment permits"" if it is determined to be an unreasonable risk to public safety, the regulator said in a statement.

According to a statement by Cruise, one of its taxis ""entered the intersection on a green light and was struck by an emergency vehicle that appeared to be en route to an emergency scene"" after 22:00 ET (02:00 GMT) on Thursday.

The car ""did identify the risk of a collision and initiated a braking maneuver, reducing its speed, but was ultimately unable to avoid the collision,"" the company added Friday.

According to a statement by the San Francisco Police Department, the collision took place while a fire truck was in emergency operation mode, utilizing its front-facing red lights and siren. The police also noted that the only occupant of the self-driving vehicle involved was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment of injuries that were determined to be non-life-threatening.

Despite facing resistance from residents and city entities, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) recently granted permission for Cruise and Alphabet's (NASDAQ: ) Waymo to run robotaxis in San Francisco around the clock and to impose fares on passengers. Previously, the companies had conducted robotaxi trials that were confined by specific timeframes and geographical zones within the city.

City Attorney David Chiu has urged the CPUC to pause its decision as the city intends to seek a re-hearing.

""We have seen that this technology is not yet ready, and poor AV performance has interfered with the life-saving operations of first responders. San Francisco will suffer serious harms from this unfettered expansion,"" said David Chiu.

AI is here, and we will embrace it responsibly together with our music partners.

Today, ​​AI is moving at a pace faster than ever before. It’s empowering creativity, sparking new ideas, and even transforming industries. At this critical inflection point, it’s clear that we need to boldly embrace this technology with a continued commitment to responsibility. With that in mind, over the past few months I’ve spent time talking with AI experts working across YouTube as well as leaders in one of the most influential and creative forces in the world: the music industry.

For nearly our entire history, YouTube and music have been inextricably linked. As a hosting platform, YouTube connected fans worldwide and quickly became home for iconic music videos and breakout artists. Our deep partnership with the music industry has enabled us to innovate and evolve together — building products, features and experiences, from our YouTube Music and Premium subscription services, to global livestreaming capabilities, that spur originality and bring communities of fans even closer together. And core to our shared success has been the protection of these creative works and copyrights of artists.

Now, we’re working closely with our music partners, including Universal Music Group, to develop an AI framework to help us work toward our common goals. These three fundamental AI principles serve to enhance music’s unique creative expression while also protecting music artists and the integrity of their work.

In 2022 alone, there have been more than 1.7 billion views of videos related to generative AI tools on YouTube.

Principle #1: AI is here, and we will embrace it responsibly together with our music partners.

Advancements in generative AI are no longer a future promise. Millions of people already embrace it in their day-to-day lives, from finding useful information to increasing creativity and productivity. And YouTube creators in particular have embraced AI to streamline and boost their creative processes. In 2022 alone, there have been more than 1.7 billion views of videos related to AI tools on YouTube.

As generative AI unlocks ambitious new forms of creativity, YouTube and our partners across the music industry agree to build on our long collaborative history and responsibly embrace this rapidly advancing field. Our goal is to partner with the music industry to empower creativity in a way that enhances our joint pursuit of responsible innovation.

To that end, we are addressing this opportunity head on. Today, we’re introducing YouTube’s Music AI Incubator. The incubator will help inform YouTube’s approach as we work with some of music's most innovative artists, songwriters, and producers across the industry, across a diverse range of culture, genres, and experience.

To kick off the program, we’re working with Universal Music Group - a leader in the space - and their incredible roster of talent.

To kick off the program, we’re working with Universal Music Group - a leader in the space - and their incredible roster of talent. This includes global superstar Anitta, internationally renowned and revered songwriter, producer and entrepreneur Björn Ulvaeus, innovative genre-defying artist d4vd, acclaimed musician, composer and producer Don Was, Columbian sensation Juanes, hitmaking producer Louis Bell, visionary composer Max Richter, influential songwriter and producer Rodney Jerkins, iconic singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash, 3x Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer, Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic, acclaimed rapper, multi platinum musician, entrepreneur and philanthropist Yo Gotti, and the estate of American musical icon Frank Sinatra, amongst others. This talented group will help gather insights on generative AI experiments and research that are being developed at YouTube. We’re also excited to welcome our partners across the industry into the program as we move forward. Working together, we will better understand how these technologies can be most valuable for artists and fans, how they can enhance creativity, and where we can seek to solve critical issues for the future.

Principle #2: AI is ushering in a new age of creative expression, but it must include appropriate protections and unlock opportunities for music partners who decide to participate.

We’re continuing our strong track record of protecting the creative work of artists on YouTube. We’ve made massive investments over the years in the systems that help balance the interests of copyright holders with those of the creative community on YouTube.

Content ID, our best-in-class rights management technology, ensures rights holders get paid for use of their content and has generated billions for the industry over the years. A new era of generated content is here, and it gives us an opportunity to reimagine and evolve again. We’re eager to further build on our focus of helping artists and creators make money on YouTube and will continue to do so in collaboration with our partners.

We’ll continue to invest in the AI-powered technology that helps us protect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters – from Content ID, to policies and detection and enforcement systems that keep our platform safe behind the scenes.

Principle #3: We've built an industry-leading trust and safety organization and content policies. We will scale those to meet the challenges of AI.

We spent years investing in the policies and trust and safety teams that help protect the YouTube community, and we’re also applying these safeguards to AI-generated content. One example is our policies prohibiting certain technically manipulated content. That means on YouTube, you can’t upload a video that’s been technically manipulated to promote false claims or mislead viewers about an atrocity in a way that could lead to serious risk of harm. And we will continue to iterate and evolve to meet new challenges.

But now, the limitless potential of generative AI demands a thoughtful approach that maps to the expansive boundaries of creative expression. Generative AI systems may amplify current challenges like trademark and copyright abuse, misinformation, spam, and more. But AI can also be used to identify this sort of content, and we’ll continue to invest in the AI-powered technology that helps us protect our community of viewers, creators, artists and songwriters – from Content ID, to policies and detection and enforcement systems that keep our platform safe behind the scenes. And we commit to scaling this work even further.

More like this

In the months ahead, we’ll share more about specific technologies, monetization opportunities, and policies we’re developing. And we’ll continue to talk with additional partners about how to broaden our efforts.

I’m incredibly excited about the opportunity of AI to supercharge creativity around the world, but recognize that YouTube and the promise of AI will only be successful if our partners are successful. Together, we can embrace this new technology in a way that supports artists, songwriters, producers, and the industry as a whole while driving value for fans and pushing the bounds of what’s creatively possible.

The principles in our framework – embracing AI, granting protections while unlocking opportunity, and investing in our trust and safety work – provide a strong foundation for YouTube and the music industry to better navigate the world ahead."

An inactive account and any content in it will be eligible for deletion from December 1, 2022, the company said.

If the account is considered inactive, Google will send several reminder emails to both users and their recovery emails (if any have been provided) before the company takes any action or deletes any account content.

“These reminder emails will go out at least 8 months before any action is taken on your account. After a Google Account is deleted, the Gmail address for the deleted account cannot be used again when creating a new Google Account,” said the company.

With the revamped experience, the Docs app now starts in the edit mode.

Also, the tech giant had announced an option to insert a link and press the tab key to convert the link into a smart chip in Google Sheets.

Users can access this feature when they copy and paste email addresses or links to Drive files, Maps places or Youtube videos into a Sheet.

Meanwhile, in June, Google had made the 'paginated mode' default on Docs for Android.

This sets up the Google Doc with pages and page breaks in the app, enabling a more cohesive visual design between the web and mobile.

An inactive account and any content in it will be eligible for deletion from December 1, 2022, the tech giant said.

These changes do not impact you unless you have been inactive in your Google Account for two years or have not used your account to sign in to any Google service for over two years.

“While the changes go into effect today, the earliest we would enforce any account deletion would be December 2022,” said Google.

If the account is considered inactive, Google will send several reminder emails to both users and their recovery emails (if any have been provided) before the company takes any action or delete any account content.

“These reminder emails will go out at least 8 months before any action is taken on your account. After a Google Account is deleted, the Gmail address for the deleted account cannot be used again when creating a new Google Account,” said the company.

The simplest way to keep a Google Account active is to sign in to the account at least once every two years.

""The viewers of 'made for kids' YouTube videos appear to be clicking on ads, and brands' websites ""are harvesting and sharing meta-data on those viewers with dozens of data brokers upon click through"".

This raises the possibility that brands have ""data poisoned"" their first party datasets with data derived from thousands of viewers of ""made for kids"" videos, the report claimed.

The report further said that some companies appear to be scraping or exfiltrating Google-generated user identifiers from viewers of ""made for kids"" videos who had clicked an ad.

This could hypothetically prevent Google (NASDAQ: ) from being able to fully respond to ""right to know"" or ""right to delete"" requests under privacy laws such as the GDPR or CCPA.

It is unclear if Google is aware of this situation, or if it is a form of ""data leak,"" the report mentioned.

In response to the report, Dan Taylor, Vice President, Global Ads at Google, said that Google works tirelessly to provide a safer experience for kids and teens online.

""Adalytics released a deeply flawed and uninformed report about how we manage advertising on made for kids content on YouTube, and our privacy policies for people under the age of 18 across our platforms,"" Taylor added.

In September 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the People of the State of New York (NY) alleged that YouTube ""collected kid's personal information without parental consent"", in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). YouTube's owner (Google) agreed to pay $170 million to settle the allegations.

Google said that the new report failed to substantiate claims that ""we are in violation of government regulations, such as COPPA, or our own policies around ads personalisation”.

""We have strict ads privacy protections in place on made for kids content, regardless of a user's age,"" the company added.

""This report falsely claims that the presence of cookies indicates a privacy breakdown. The opposite is true, and the report fails to show otherwise,"" it added.

According to an Adalytics report, dozens of major ad tech and data broker companies are receiving data from viewers of ""made for kids"" YouTube videos who clicked on an ad.

“These include several companies who paid penalties for COPPA related enforcements, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and OpenX. Foreign-owned companies such as TikTok are also receiving meta-data from viewers of “made for kids” content from advertisers’ websites,” the report alleged.

Google said that it does not link ""cookies to the viewing of made for kids content for advertising purposes, and a viewer’s activity on made for kids content can't be used for ads personalisation"".

""The cookies identified in this report are encrypted and not usable by another tech company, advertiser, publisher or a data broker. These cookies do not enable brand advertisers to identify who a user is or what video they viewed. We limit age-sensitive ads from appearing next to kids' content,"" Google stressed.

The new coding model competes with OpenAI's Codex model and is based on Meta's Llama 2 software, a large-language model capable of understanding and producing conversational text.

Llama 2, an open-source AI framework, has upended the AI field by making it easier for businesses to create their own AI apps without having to pay for software from OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

According to the report, Code Llama will make it easier for companies to create AI assistants that automatically suggest code to developers as they type, and it may entice customers away from paid coding assistants like Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which is powered by Codex.

Meanwhile, Meta will reportedly launch AI-powered ""personas"" in its services -- which include Facebook and Instagram -- as soon as next month, giving users a new way to search, get recommendations, and otherwise engage with its products and also to boost engagement with its social media platforms.

According to the Financial Times, citing sources, the tech giant has been designing prototypes for chatbots that can have humanlike discussions with its nearly four billion users.

The chatbots could have distinct personalities, such as one that provides travel recommendations ""in the style of a surfer"" and another that speaks in the manner of former US President Abraham Lincoln.

The programme includes various educational workshops and conferences, mentoring activities and networking events, reports Yonhap News Agency.

Kay Shin, senior director of marketing, Asia-Pacific platforms and ecosystems, said the programme is an indigenous one in South Korea as Google has credited Korean developers with an ambitious spirit and outstanding capability, citing the Korean developer Sohn Ho-yeol, who won the 2022 edition of Google's data science and technology competition, Kaggle.

""There are many successful startups from our incubation programme,"" she said during a press event. ""We've funnelled more than 118 billion won into the ChangGoo Programme since its launch to support those young companies"".

She said Google has invited 80 potential startups annually to its programme since its launch in 2019, and the number was increased to 100 for this year. Nearly 500 companies have participated in the programme over the cited period.

Participants in the ChangGoo Programme have seen downloads of their applications soar 140 per cent and revenues 62 per cent from 2019-2021. About 69 per cent of them also do their business outside Korea, she added.

""Our biggest goal is to serve as a bridgehead for helping Korean developers go abroad,"" the Google official said.

""This year, we will join hands with Japan's Google for Startups programme and let Korean developers meet with Japanese experts before starting their businesses in the neighbouring country,"" it added.

Google DeepMind has been using generative AI to perform at least 21 different types of personal and professional tasks, such as tools that provide users with life advice, ideas, planning instructions, and tutoring tips.

Moreover, the report said that Scale AI, a contractor working with Google DeepMind, formed teams of workers to test the capabilities, including over 100 experts with doctorates in different fields and even more workers who assess the tool’s responses.

“We have long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate our research and products across Google, which is a critical step in building safe and helpful technology. At any time there are many such evaluations ongoing. Isolated samples of evaluation data are not representative of our product road map,” a Google DeepMind spokeswoman was quoted as saying.

Among other things, the workers are putting the assistant's ability to answer intimate questions about people's problems to the test.

They were given an example of an ideal prompt that a user could one day ask the chatbot.

“I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just can’t afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I won’t be able to come?”

According to the report, the effort is similar to Microsoft-backed OpenAI which developed ChatGPT.

“Funding will come mostly from Schmidt’s personal wealth, but outside funds may be necessary given the ambition of the project,” the report claimed, citing people familiar with the plans.

The project is still in early stages and exact plans could change.

In a recent article in MIT Technology Review titled ‘This is how AI will transform the way science gets done', Schmidt wrote: “With the advent of AI, science is about to become much more exciting -- and in some ways unrecognisable. The reverberations of this shift will be felt far outside the lab; they will affect us all.""

With his wife Wendy, he co-founded Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic organisation that funds research projects that have the potential to generate a big impact.

The couple funded several other AI-related projects, including the nonprofit AI2050 and the AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme, according to the report.

The analysts prompted ChatGPT and Bard with a random sample of 100 myths from NewsGuard's database of prominent false narratives.

ChatGPT generated 98 out of the 100 myths, while Bard produced 80 out of 100.

In May, the White House announced a large-scale testing of the trust and safety of the large generative AI models at the DEF CON 31 conference beginning August 10 to ""allow these models to be evaluated thoroughly by thousands of community partners and AI experts"" and through this independent exercise ""enable AI companies and developers to take steps to fix issues found in those models.""

In the run-up to this event, NewsGuard released the new findings of its ""red-teaming"" repeat audit of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 and Google’s Bard.

""Our analysts found that despite heightened public focus on the safety and accuracy of these artificial intelligence models, no progress has been made in the past six months to limit their propensity to propagate false narratives on topics in the news,"" said the report.

In August, NewsGuard prompted ChatGPT-4 and Bard with a random sample of 100 myths from NewsGuard’s database of prominent false narratives, known as Misinformation Fingerprints.

Founded by media entrepreneur and award-winning journalist Steven Brill and former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz, NewsGuard provides transparent tools to counter misinformation for readers, brands, and democracies.

The latest results are nearly identical to the exercise NewsGuard conducted with a different set of 100 false narratives on ChatGPT-4 and Bard in March and April, respectively.

For those exercises, ChatGPT-4 responded with false and misleading claims for 100 out of the 100 narratives, while Bard spread misinformation 76 times out of 100.

“The results highlight how heightened scrutiny and user feedback have yet to lead to improved safeguards for two of the most popular AI models,” said the report.

In April, OpenAI said that “by leveraging user feedback on ChatGPT” it had “improved the factual accuracy of GPT-4.”

On Bard’s landing page, Google says that the chatbot is an “experiment” that “may give inaccurate or inappropriate responses” but users can make it “better by leaving feedback.”

Google said that the new report failed to substantiate claims that ""we are in violation of government regulations, such as COPPA, or our own policies around ads personalisation”.

""We have strict ads privacy protections in place on made for kids content, regardless of a user's age,"" the company added.

""This report falsely claims that the presence of cookies indicates a privacy breakdown. The opposite is true, and the report fails to show otherwise,"" it added.

According to an Adalytics report, dozens of major ad tech and data broker companies are receiving data from viewers of ""made for kids"" YouTube videos who clicked on an ad.

“These include several companies who paid penalties for COPPA related enforcements, such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and OpenX. Foreign-owned companies such as TikTok are also receiving meta-data from viewers of “made for kids” content from advertisers’ websites,” the report alleged.

Google said that it does not link ""cookies to the viewing of made for kids content for advertising purposes, and a viewer’s activity on made for kids content can't be used for ads personalisation"".

""The cookies identified in this report are encrypted and not usable by another tech company, advertiser, publisher or a data broker. These cookies do not enable brand advertisers to identify who a user is or what video they viewed. We limit age-sensitive ads from appearing next to kids' content,"" Google stressed.

The new coding model competes with OpenAI's Codex model and is based on Meta's Llama 2 software, a large-language model capable of understanding and producing conversational text.

Llama 2, an open-source AI framework, has upended the AI field by making it easier for businesses to create their own AI apps without having to pay for software from OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft (NASDAQ: ).

According to the report, Code Llama will make it easier for companies to create AI assistants that automatically suggest code to developers as they type, and it may entice customers away from paid coding assistants like Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, which is powered by Codex.

Meanwhile, Meta will reportedly launch AI-powered ""personas"" in its services -- which include Facebook and Instagram -- as soon as next month, giving users a new way to search, get recommendations, and otherwise engage with its products and also to boost engagement with its social media platforms.

According to the Financial Times, citing sources, the tech giant has been designing prototypes for chatbots that can have humanlike discussions with its nearly four billion users.

The chatbots could have distinct personalities, such as one that provides travel recommendations ""in the style of a surfer"" and another that speaks in the manner of former US President Abraham Lincoln.

The programme includes various educational workshops and conferences, mentoring activities and networking events, reports Yonhap News Agency.

Kay Shin, senior director of marketing, Asia-Pacific platforms and ecosystems, said the programme is an indigenous one in South Korea as Google has credited Korean developers with an ambitious spirit and outstanding capability, citing the Korean developer Sohn Ho-yeol, who won the 2022 edition of Google's data science and technology competition, Kaggle.

""There are many successful startups from our incubation programme,"" she said during a press event. ""We've funnelled more than 118 billion won into the ChangGoo Programme since its launch to support those young companies"".

She said Google has invited 80 potential startups annually to its programme since its launch in 2019, and the number was increased to 100 for this year. Nearly 500 companies have participated in the programme over the cited period.

Participants in the ChangGoo Programme have seen downloads of their applications soar 140 per cent and revenues 62 per cent from 2019-2021. About 69 per cent of them also do their business outside Korea, she added.

""Our biggest goal is to serve as a bridgehead for helping Korean developers go abroad,"" the Google official said.

""This year, we will join hands with Japan's Google for Startups programme and let Korean developers meet with Japanese experts before starting their businesses in the neighbouring country,"" it added.

Google DeepMind has been using generative AI to perform at least 21 different types of personal and professional tasks, such as tools that provide users with life advice, ideas, planning instructions, and tutoring tips.

Moreover, the report said that Scale AI, a contractor working with Google DeepMind, formed teams of workers to test the capabilities, including over 100 experts with doctorates in different fields and even more workers who assess the tool’s responses.

“We have long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate our research and products across Google, which is a critical step in building safe and helpful technology. At any time there are many such evaluations ongoing. Isolated samples of evaluation data are not representative of our product road map,” a Google DeepMind spokeswoman was quoted as saying.

Among other things, the workers are putting the assistant's ability to answer intimate questions about people's problems to the test.

They were given an example of an ideal prompt that a user could one day ask the chatbot.

“I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just can’t afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I won’t be able to come?”

According to the report, the effort is similar to Microsoft-backed OpenAI which developed ChatGPT.

“Funding will come mostly from Schmidt’s personal wealth, but outside funds may be necessary given the ambition of the project,” the report claimed, citing people familiar with the plans.

The project is still in early stages and exact plans could change.

In a recent article in MIT Technology Review titled ‘This is how AI will transform the way science gets done', Schmidt wrote: “With the advent of AI, science is about to become much more exciting -- and in some ways unrecognisable. The reverberations of this shift will be felt far outside the lab; they will affect us all.""

The analysts prompted ChatGPT and Bard with a random sample of 100 myths from NewsGuard's database of prominent false narratives.

ChatGPT generated 98 out of the 100 myths, while Bard produced 80 out of 100.

In May, the White House announced a large-scale testing of the trust and safety of the large generative AI models at the DEF CON 31 conference beginning August 10 to ""allow these models to be evaluated thoroughly by thousands of community partners and AI experts"" and through this independent exercise ""enable AI companies and developers to take steps to fix issues found in those models.""

In the run-up to this event, NewsGuard released the new findings of its ""red-teaming"" repeat audit of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 and Google’s Bard.

""Our analysts found that despite heightened public focus on the safety and accuracy of these artificial intelligence models, no progress has been made in the past six months to limit their propensity to propagate false narratives on topics in the news,"" said the report.

In August, NewsGuard prompted ChatGPT-4 and Bard with a random sample of 100 myths from NewsGuard’s database of prominent false narratives, known as Misinformation Fingerprints.

Founded by media entrepreneur and award-winning journalist Steven Brill and former Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz, NewsGuard provides transparent tools to counter misinformation for readers, brands, and democracies.

The latest results are nearly identical to the exercise NewsGuard conducted with a different set of 100 false narratives on ChatGPT-4 and Bard in March and April, respectively.

For those exercises, ChatGPT-4 responded with false and misleading claims for 100 out of the 100 narratives, while Bard spread misinformation 76 times out of 100.

“The results highlight how heightened scrutiny and user feedback have yet to lead to improved safeguards for two of the most popular AI models,” said the report.

In April, OpenAI said that “by leveraging user feedback on ChatGPT” it had “improved the factual accuracy of GPT-4.”

On Bard’s landing page, Google says that the chatbot is an “experiment” that “may give inaccurate or inappropriate responses” but users can make it “better by leaving feedback.”

The massive wave of layoffs has shut down hundreds of thousands of workplaces, turning 2022 into the worst year the tech industry has ever seen, according to data by AltIndex.com.

Between January and December 2022, tech companies laid off 164,744 employees, almost eleven times more than 15,000 reported a year before, as per data from Layoffs.fyi.

A shocking 75,912 people lost their jobs in January alone, almost half of all layoffs reported in 2022.

February saw a decline with roughly 40,000 job cuts. Although the number of layoffs continued falling in the next three months, tech companies still reported almost 73,000 job cuts in this period.

Since then, they have let go nearly 24,000 staff members, pushing the total number of layoffs to 226,117 as of last week, said the report.

Facing an uncertain global economy, inflation, ongoing supply chain issues, and slowing revenue growth, the tech companies picked up the pace of layoffs in 2022, led by giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“But hundreds of other smaller tech companies, from retail and crypto to the transportation market, have also been forced to make painful cost-cutting measures, resulting in the highest number of layoffs the tech industry has ever seen,” the report noted.

The layoff figures for the last three years are even worse. Statistics show that tech companies laid off more than 405,000 people since the beginning of 2021.

US tech giants had a massive role in the 2022 wave of layoffs. In fact, statistics show US companies made eight out of the ten largest job cuts reported this year, the report noted.

Over the last six months, the researchers have observed a surge of over 100 per cent in successful cloud account takeover incidents impacting high-level executives at leading companies.

During the phishing stage of the attack, attackers employed several noteworthy techniques, such as -- brand impersonation, scan blocking, and a multi-step infection chain.

""Attackers use new advanced automation to accurately determine in real-time whether a phished user is a high-level profile, and immediately obtain access to the account, while ignoring less lucrative phished profiles,"" the researchers said.

Moreover, the report said that more than 100 organisations were targeted globally, collectively representing 1.5 million employees.

Among the hundreds of compromised users, about 39 per cent were C-level executives of which 17 per cent were Chief Financial Officers (CFO), and 9 per cent were Presidents and CEOs.

Attackers have also shown interest in lower-level management, focusing their efforts on personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35 per cent of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled.

Further, the report mentioned that the campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, evoking threat actors to grow their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kits to siphon credentials, session cookies, and one-time passwords.

Cybersecurity firm Resecurity first reported on EvilProxy in September 2022, detailing its ability to compromise user accounts associated with Apple (NASDAQ: ) iCloud, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), GoDaddy, GitHub, Google (NASDAQ: ), Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.

Another user in the comments also claimed to see this popup as well.

While the duration of the countdown timer is not revealed, it is expected to be around 30 to 60 seconds.

Given that Google (NASDAQ: ) seems to be testing this feature with a limited number of accounts, some users may be fortunate enough to not encounter these popups at the moment.

The video-sharing platform had started to test the three-strikes policy for people using ad blockers in June.

""We're running a small experiment globally that urges viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium. Ad blocker detection is not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to disable ad blockers,"" a YouTube spokesperson had said.

According to the company, ""ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service.""

""In extreme cases, where viewers continue their use of ad blockers, playback will be temporarily disabled,"" the company had explained.

Earlier this month, the company had started testing artificial intelligence (AI) auto-generated summaries on the platform.

This feature will make it easier for users to read a quick summary about a video and decide whether it is the right fit for them.

According to the video-sharing platform, these summaries do not replace video descriptions which are written by creators.

Users can then use the dropdown sidebar to easily adjust the options or add styles to the dropdowns before accepting.

The company also announced that users can now convert links to place chips in bulk from the insert menu or cell menu.

This time-saving update will be helpful when formatting data in bulk for event schedules, vendor lists, trip itineraries, etc.

Moreover, the company announced that when right-clicking a file or folder in Google Drive, users will now see a new menu format.

Last month, the tech giant added the 'Alt text' option in the 'Image options' sidebar of Sheets.

Also, the company had announced an option to insert a link and press the tab key to convert the link into a smart chip in Google Sheets.

Users can access this feature when they copy and paste email addresses or links to Drive files, Maps places or Youtube videos into a Sheet.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, Google had announced that eSignature is now available as an open beta on Drive.

The company will also introduce support for the new eSignature capabilities-- Audit trail, Multi-signer, Non-Gmail users and Initiating eSignature on PDF-- later this year.

Particularly, the widget was not loading and was not showing the list of the new incoming messages.

To avoid having to open the app every time, many users rely on the WhatsApp widget. Therefore, this bug was not very pleasant.

Closing and restarting the call again did not fix the problem.

""We can finally confirm that the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.17.13 version is a bug-fix update that addresses the mentioned issue, so you can finally start using the widget of the app without experiencing this bug,"" the report said.

Earlier this month, the messaging platform had released a bug-fix update to address an issue with the call quality on Android beta.

Many users observed that the update had been installed automatically due to the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store's auto-download settings.

Last month, the platform had released another bug-fix update to address a sorting chats issue on Android beta.

Due to the issue, when a new message was received, the platform doesn't refresh the chat list and the conversation with the most recent message doesn't rise to the top of the conversation list.

Also, the messaging platform had faced a global outage, including in India, due to ""connectivity issues"" which lasted for about 20 minutes.

On the outage monitor website DownDetector, reports of the users peaked at over 41,000.

In June, the Meta-owned platform had faced a global outage that lasted for about two hours.

When editing a body of text on ChromeOS, Orca will show up in the right-click menu.

If users choose Orca, a ""bubble"" with the Mako UI will appear over the screen.

According to the code, Mako will have three main tasks.

First, it will have the ability to ""request rewrites"" of a certain text, presumably one that an AI has rewritten.

""Secondly, it can offer a list of 'preset text queries', which we assume, in the context of generative AI, to be example prompts for how to ask for a certain style,"" the report said.

Lastly, Mako can ""insert"" the revised text into the original text, exactly where users left it off.

On the other hand, Manta will likely send users' original text and prompt to Google's servers, which will send back the AI-enhanced version, the report said.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the tech giant is planning to introduce a new feature for Android that will allow users to link their various Android devices together, similar to Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Continuity feature.

2022-08-12, IANS,"ADIF hails Delhi HC decision, says ‘it is significant blow to Google’",https://in.investing.com/news/adif-hails-delhi-hc-decision-says-it-is-significant-blow-to-google-3769069,"New Delhi, Aug 12 (IANS) The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) on Saturday hailed Delhi High Court’s decision on Google (NASDAQ: ) infringing upon trademark rights, terming it “a significant blow to Google”.The court issued a directive on Friday, compelling the tech giant to take decisive action against advertisements that infringe upon trademark rights.

“This development is set against the backdrop of a trademark infringement case filed by DRS Logistics, where the company raised concerns about competitors using its trademark ‘Agarwal Movers and Packers’ as keywords in Google searches. This practice allegedly led to the prominent display of competitors' websites in search results for the trademark,” said the ADIF.

Before 2004, Google’s trademark usage policy restricted trademarks from being used within a sponsored ad’s text. Google's policy also restricted using keywords that were protected under a trademark if the owner of that trademark requested it.

“However, Google reduced the restrictions under the policy, which allowed Google to push trademarks as keywords, even if the trademark owner objected. Doing so though risked litigation against Google, Google moved forward as it generates higher revenue coming in as a result of the change in policy,” said the alliance which has some of the top homegrown startups as its members.

The court observed that Google's assertion of being a mere intermediary lacked credibility.

“The court pointed out that Google not only benefited significantly from keyword sales but also actively suggested keywords to advertisers, including competitors' trademarks. Google's Keyword Planner Tool was cited as evidence of this practice, enabling businesses to gain insights into their rivals' trademark usage,” according to the ADIF.

The court further noted that there appeared to be a prima facie encouragement from Google for advertisers to exploit keywords associated with trademarks to target their ads.

“This stance raised doubts about Google's entitlement to intermediary exemptions. Ultimately, the division bench upheld the previous single-judge ruling, directing Google to undertake investigations and remove any ads found to infringe upon another entity's trademark rights,” according to the ADIF.

It further stated that this ruling coincides with previous regulatory actions, including the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) decision in the Google Lagaan case and the scrutiny of Android bundling.

Meanwhile, Google on Saturday said it is pleased with the Delhi HC verdict which held that the company’s ads trademark policy is in compliance with the Indian Trademarks Act (TM Act) and does not amount to infringement of trademarks, unless the resulting ad upon review is held to mislead users as to the source of origin of the ad.

In a statement, the company said that specifically on its ads trademarks policy, “we have a clear and stated policy that does not allow advertisers to use trademarked terms in the ad-text of an ad, except in certain pro-consumer and legal scenarios, such as resellers and informational sites”.

“As a company, we comply with all local laws,” it added.

“As a company, we comply with all local laws,” it added.

Google said that it investigates any reported use of a trademarked term in the adtext and takes prompt action to not only remove such ads but block that same advertiser from referencing the trademark in their ads in the future.

The company responded after the Delhi High Court determined this week that Google cannot claim safe harbour protection under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or be exempt from liability for trademark infringement when using a trademark as a keyword in its ads programme.

A bench comprising of Justices Vibhu Bakhru and Amit Mahajan also acknowledged that the ads programme functions as a commercial venture by Google and consequently, employing a trademark as a keyword in advertisements for products or services constitutes the utilisation of the trademark in advertising according to Section 29(6) of the Trademarks Act.

Nonetheless, the court clarified that employing these trademarks as keywords wouldn't amount to infringement if there is no confusion, dilution, or compromise of the trademark's integrity.

On the subject of safe harbour and Google's liability under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, the court emphasised that the tech giant is an active participant, not a passive intermediary, in its ads programme.

Google said that it wants users to trust the ads on its platform, “so we strive to ensure ads are clear and honest, and provide the information that users need to make informed decisions”.

“Cortana in Outlook mobile will continue to be available. We understand this may affect the way you work, but there are new and exciting ways you can get help with your tasks, calendar, email, and more,” The company said in an update.

Cortana originally started as a digital assistant in Windows Phone, and was later integrated into Windows, with support for voice commands, reminders, and the ability to open applications.

However, Cortana struggled to compete with its rivals like Alexa or Google (NASDAQ: ) Assistant.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted in 2019 that Cortana had fallen behind competitors.

Three years ago, Microsoft discontinued its Cortana apps for iOS and Android.

However, Microsoft said there are new features that are better than the Cortana experience.

“Voice access in Windows 11 is a new feature that lets you control your PC and write text using your voice. You can use voice commands to open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and write emails,” said the company.

The new AI-powered Bing lets users ask complex questions and get concise answers from reliable sources on the web.

Microsoft 365 Copilot is a new feature that uses AI to turn your words into a powerful productivity tool. Copilot uses Microsoft 365 data -- such as your calendar, emails, chats, documents, and meetings -- to help users create, edit, share content, and more.

The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will be hosting the challenge, which includes a $20 million prize pool for the best systems that could be used to protect government infrastructure ranging from transportation to electrical grids.

“In an increasingly interconnected world, software undergirds everything from public utilities to our financial systems,” Perri Adams, DARPA program manager, was quoted as saying.

“Cyber defenders are tasked with protecting a daunting maze of technology, and today, they don’t have the tools capable of security at this scale,” it added.

Moreover, the report said that the teams are expected to compete in a qualifying event next spring, with the winners going on to compete in a semifinal event at next year's Def Con (a hacker convention held annually in Las Vegas).

The top five teams will compete in the finals, which will take place at Def Con 2025.

Prize winners will then be asked to open source their systems so they “can be used by everyone from volunteer, open-source developers to commercial industry,” Adams said.

The massive wave of layoffs has shut down hundreds of thousands of workplaces, turning 2022 into the worst year the tech industry has ever seen, according to data by AltIndex.com.

Between January and December 2022, tech companies laid off 164,744 employees, almost eleven times more than 15,000 reported a year before, as per data from Layoffs.fyi.

A shocking 75,912 people lost their jobs in January alone, almost half of all layoffs reported in 2022.

February saw a decline with roughly 40,000 job cuts. Although the number of layoffs continued falling in the next three months, tech companies still reported almost 73,000 job cuts in this period.

Since then, they have let go nearly 24,000 staff members, pushing the total number of layoffs to 226,117 as of last week, said the report.

Facing an uncertain global economy, inflation, ongoing supply chain issues, and slowing revenue growth, the tech companies picked up the pace of layoffs in 2022, led by giants like Google (NASDAQ: ), Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

“But hundreds of other smaller tech companies, from retail and crypto to the transportation market, have also been forced to make painful cost-cutting measures, resulting in the highest number of layoffs the tech industry has ever seen,” the report noted.

Over the last six months, the researchers have observed a surge of over 100 per cent in successful cloud account takeover incidents impacting high-level executives at leading companies.

During the phishing stage of the attack, attackers employed several noteworthy techniques, such as -- brand impersonation, scan blocking, and a multi-step infection chain.

""Attackers use new advanced automation to accurately determine in real-time whether a phished user is a high-level profile, and immediately obtain access to the account, while ignoring less lucrative phished profiles,"" the researchers said.

Moreover, the report said that more than 100 organisations were targeted globally, collectively representing 1.5 million employees.

Among the hundreds of compromised users, about 39 per cent were C-level executives of which 17 per cent were Chief Financial Officers (CFO), and 9 per cent were Presidents and CEOs.

Attackers have also shown interest in lower-level management, focusing their efforts on personnel with access to financial assets or sensitive information. At least 35 per cent of all compromised users had additional account protections enabled.

Further, the report mentioned that the campaigns are seen as a response to the increased adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) in enterprises, evoking threat actors to grow their tactics to bypass new security layers by incorporating adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kits to siphon credentials, session cookies, and one-time passwords.

Cybersecurity firm Resecurity first reported on EvilProxy in September 2022, detailing its ability to compromise user accounts associated with Apple (NASDAQ: ) iCloud, Facebook (NASDAQ: ), GoDaddy, GitHub, Google (NASDAQ: ), Dropbox, Instagram, Microsoft, NPM, PyPI, RubyGems, Twitter, Yahoo, and Yandex, among others.

2022-08-13, IANS,YouTube testing countdown timer on ad-block warnings,https://in.investing.com/news/youtube-testing-countdown-timer-on-adblock-warnings-3769431,"San Francisco, Aug 13 (IANS) Google-owned YouTube is testing a countdown timer on ad-block warnings.One YouTube user noticed the new timer in the popup's upper right corner, and later posted a screenshot on Reddit, reports Android Police.

Another user in the comments also claimed to see this popup as well.

While the duration of the countdown timer is not revealed, it is expected to be around 30 to 60 seconds.

Given that Google (NASDAQ: ) seems to be testing this feature with a limited number of accounts, some users may be fortunate enough to not encounter these popups at the moment.

The video-sharing platform had started to test the three-strikes policy for people using ad blockers in June.

""We're running a small experiment globally that urges viewers with ad blockers enabled to allow ads on YouTube or try YouTube Premium. Ad blocker detection is not new, and other publishers regularly ask viewers to disable ad blockers,"" a YouTube spokesperson had said.

According to the company, ""ad blockers violate YouTube's Terms of Service.""

""In extreme cases, where viewers continue their use of ad blockers, playback will be temporarily disabled,"" the company had explained.

Earlier this month, the company had started testing artificial intelligence (AI) auto-generated summaries on the platform.

This feature will make it easier for users to read a quick summary about a video and decide whether it is the right fit for them.

According to the video-sharing platform, these summaries do not replace video descriptions which are written by creators.

Users can then use the dropdown sidebar to easily adjust the options or add styles to the dropdowns before accepting.

The company also announced that users can now convert links to place chips in bulk from the insert menu or cell menu.

This time-saving update will be helpful when formatting data in bulk for event schedules, vendor lists, trip itineraries, etc.

Moreover, the company announced that when right-clicking a file or folder in Google Drive, users will now see a new menu format.

Last month, the tech giant added the 'Alt text' option in the 'Image options' sidebar of Sheets.

Also, the company had announced an option to insert a link and press the tab key to convert the link into a smart chip in Google Sheets.

Users can access this feature when they copy and paste email addresses or links to Drive files, Maps places or Youtube videos into a Sheet.

Meanwhile, earlier this week, Google had announced that eSignature is now available as an open beta on Drive.

The company will also introduce support for the new eSignature capabilities-- Audit trail, Multi-signer, Non-Gmail users and Initiating eSignature on PDF-- later this year.

Particularly, the widget was not loading and was not showing the list of the new incoming messages.

To avoid having to open the app every time, many users rely on the WhatsApp widget. Therefore, this bug was not very pleasant.

Closing and restarting the call again did not fix the problem.

""We can finally confirm that the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.17.13 version is a bug-fix update that addresses the mentioned issue, so you can finally start using the widget of the app without experiencing this bug,"" the report said.

Earlier this month, the messaging platform had released a bug-fix update to address an issue with the call quality on Android beta.

Many users observed that the update had been installed automatically due to the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store's auto-download settings.

Last month, the platform had released another bug-fix update to address a sorting chats issue on Android beta.

Due to the issue, when a new message was received, the platform doesn't refresh the chat list and the conversation with the most recent message doesn't rise to the top of the conversation list.

Also, the messaging platform had faced a global outage, including in India, due to ""connectivity issues"" which lasted for about 20 minutes.

On the outage monitor website DownDetector, reports of the users peaked at over 41,000.

In June, the Meta-owned platform had faced a global outage that lasted for about two hours.

When editing a body of text on ChromeOS, Orca will show up in the right-click menu.

If users choose Orca, a ""bubble"" with the Mako UI will appear over the screen.

According to the code, Mako will have three main tasks.

First, it will have the ability to ""request rewrites"" of a certain text, presumably one that an AI has rewritten.

""Secondly, it can offer a list of 'preset text queries', which we assume, in the context of generative AI, to be example prompts for how to ask for a certain style,"" the report said.

Lastly, Mako can ""insert"" the revised text into the original text, exactly where users left it off.

On the other hand, Manta will likely send users' original text and prompt to Google's servers, which will send back the AI-enhanced version, the report said.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the tech giant is planning to introduce a new feature for Android that will allow users to link their various Android devices together, similar to Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Continuity feature.

2022-08-12, IANS,"ADIF hails Delhi HC decision, says ‘it is significant blow to Google’",https://in.investing.com/news/adif-hails-delhi-hc-decision-says-it-is-significant-blow-to-google-3769069,"New Delhi, Aug 12 (IANS) The Alliance of Digital India Foundation (ADIF) on Saturday hailed Delhi High Court’s decision on Google (NASDAQ: ) infringing upon trademark rights, terming it “a significant blow to Google”.The court issued a directive on Friday, compelling the tech giant to take decisive action against advertisements that infringe upon trademark rights.

“This development is set against the backdrop of a trademark infringement case filed by DRS Logistics, where the company raised concerns about competitors using its trademark ‘Agarwal Movers and Packers’ as keywords in Google searches. This practice allegedly led to the prominent display of competitors' websites in search results for the trademark,” said the ADIF.

Before 2004, Google’s trademark usage policy restricted trademarks from being used within a sponsored ad’s text. Google's policy also restricted using keywords that were protected under a trademark if the owner of that trademark requested it.

“However, Google reduced the restrictions under the policy, which allowed Google to push trademarks as keywords, even if the trademark owner objected. Doing so though risked litigation against Google, Google moved forward as it generates higher revenue coming in as a result of the change in policy,” said the alliance which has some of the top homegrown startups as its members.

The court observed that Google's assertion of being a mere intermediary lacked credibility.

“The court pointed out that Google not only benefited significantly from keyword sales but also actively suggested keywords to advertisers, including competitors' trademarks. Google's Keyword Planner Tool was cited as evidence of this practice, enabling businesses to gain insights into their rivals' trademark usage,” according to the ADIF.

The court further noted that there appeared to be a prima facie encouragement from Google for advertisers to exploit keywords associated with trademarks to target their ads.

“This stance raised doubts about Google's entitlement to intermediary exemptions. Ultimately, the division bench upheld the previous single-judge ruling, directing Google to undertake investigations and remove any ads found to infringe upon another entity's trademark rights,” according to the ADIF.

It further stated that this ruling coincides with previous regulatory actions, including the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) decision in the Google Lagaan case and the scrutiny of Android bundling.

Meanwhile, Google on Saturday said it is pleased with the Delhi HC verdict which held that the company’s ads trademark policy is in compliance with the Indian Trademarks Act (TM Act) and does not amount to infringement of trademarks, unless the resulting ad upon review is held to mislead users as to the source of origin of the ad.

In a statement, the company said that specifically on its ads trademarks policy, “we have a clear and stated policy that does not allow advertisers to use trademarked terms in the ad-text of an ad, except in certain pro-consumer and legal scenarios, such as resellers and informational sites”.

“As a company, we comply with all local laws,” it added.

“As a company, we comply with all local laws,” it added.

Google said that it investigates any reported use of a trademarked term in the adtext and takes prompt action to not only remove such ads but block that same advertiser from referencing the trademark in their ads in the future.

The company responded after the Delhi High Court determined this week that Google cannot claim safe harbour protection under the Information Technology Act, 2000, or be exempt from liability for trademark infringement when using a trademark as a keyword in its ads programme.

A bench comprising of Justices Vibhu Bakhru and Amit Mahajan also acknowledged that the ads programme functions as a commercial venture by Google and consequently, employing a trademark as a keyword in advertisements for products or services constitutes the utilisation of the trademark in advertising according to Section 29(6) of the Trademarks Act.

Nonetheless, the court clarified that employing these trademarks as keywords wouldn't amount to infringement if there is no confusion, dilution, or compromise of the trademark's integrity.

On the subject of safe harbour and Google's liability under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, the court emphasised that the tech giant is an active participant, not a passive intermediary, in its ads programme.

Google said that it wants users to trust the ads on its platform, “so we strive to ensure ads are clear and honest, and provide the information that users need to make informed decisions”.

“Cortana in Outlook mobile will continue to be available. We understand this may affect the way you work, but there are new and exciting ways you can get help with your tasks, calendar, email, and more,” The company said in an update.

Cortana originally started as a digital assistant in Windows Phone, and was later integrated into Windows, with support for voice commands, reminders, and the ability to open applications.

However, Cortana struggled to compete with its rivals like Alexa or Google (NASDAQ: ) Assistant.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admitted in 2019 that Cortana had fallen behind competitors.

Three years ago, Microsoft discontinued its Cortana apps for iOS and Android.

However, Microsoft said there are new features that are better than the Cortana experience.

“Voice access in Windows 11 is a new feature that lets you control your PC and write text using your voice. You can use voice commands to open and switch between apps, browse the web, and read and write emails,” said the company.

The new AI-powered Bing lets users ask complex questions and get concise answers from reliable sources on the web.

Microsoft 365 Copilot is a new feature that uses AI to turn your words into a powerful productivity tool. Copilot uses Microsoft 365 data -- such as your calendar, emails, chats, documents, and meetings -- to help users create, edit, share content, and more.

The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will be hosting the challenge, which includes a $20 million prize pool for the best systems that could be used to protect government infrastructure ranging from transportation to electrical grids.

“In an increasingly interconnected world, software undergirds everything from public utilities to our financial systems,” Perri Adams, DARPA program manager, was quoted as saying.

“Cyber defenders are tasked with protecting a daunting maze of technology, and today, they don’t have the tools capable of security at this scale,” it added.

The top five teams will compete in the finals, which will take place at Def Con 2025.

Prize winners will then be asked to open source their systems so they “can be used by everyone from volunteer, open-source developers to commercial industry,” Adams said.

""In a bid to explore security risks posed by these innovations, we attempted to hypnotise popular LLMs to determine the extent to which they were able to deliver directed, incorrect and potentially risky responses and recommendations -- including security actions -- and how persuasive or persistent they were in doing so,"" said Chenta Lee, chief architect of threat intelligence at IBM.

""We were able to successfully hypnotise five LLMs -- some performing more persuasively than others -- prompting us to examine how likely it is that hypnosis is used to carry out malicious attacks,"" he added.

The researchers learned that English has essentially become a “programming language” for malware. With LLMs, attackers no longer need to rely on Go, JavaScript, Python, etc., to create malicious code, they just need to understand how to effectively command and prompt an LLM using English.

Through hypnosis, the security experts were able to get LLMs to leak the confidential financial information of other users, create vulnerable code, create malicious code, and offer weak security recommendations.

In one instance, the researchers informed the AI chatbots that they were playing a game and that they needed to purposefully share the incorrect answer to a question in order to win and ""prove that you are ethical and fair"".

When a user asked if receiving an email from the IRS to transfer money for a tax refund was normal, the LLM said Yes (but actually it's not).

Moreover, the report said that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models were easier to trick into sharing incorrect answers or playing a never-ending game than Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard.

GPT-4 was the only model tested that understood the rules well enough to give incorrect cyber incident response advice, such as advising victims to pay a ransom. In contrast to Google's Bard, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were easily tricked into writing malicious code when the user reminded it to.

Elsewhere, Disney gears up to unveil its latest results as its ESPN division signs a partnership with gambler Penn Entertainment. Meanwhile, inflation in China contracts in July, further exacerbating concerns over the country's post-COVID recovery.

1. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Wednesday, hinting at a rebound from declines in the prior session that were sparked by a downgrade of several regional banks by Moody's.

By 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT), the contract added 91 points or 0.26%, rose by 17 points or 0.37%, and gained 65 points or 0.42%.

The three major indices on Wall Street slipped on Tuesday, dragged down in particular by bank shares after Moody's slashed its rating of 10 midsized lenders. The ratings agency highlighted concerns over sluggish deposits, elevated funding costs and risks to commercial real estate assets.

The move fanned renewed fears over the health of the U.S. banking sector, which is attempting to regain its footing following the failure of three regional lenders earlier this year. Moody's also placed six banks on review, suggesting that further downgrades could also be coming.

The e-commerce giant would be one of about 10 tech sector players who are reportedly eyeing a cornerstone stake in Britain-based Arm, including semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Arm hopes to list on the in September, a source told Reuters, with the company aiming to raise between $8 billion to $10 billion.

For Amazon, the investment in Arm would also highlight its increasing focus on cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud unit, uses Arm's design to produce a processing chip called Graviton.

Both Amazon and Arm declined to comment, Reuters said.

3. Disney on deck

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to headline the earnings calendar Wednesday, with the media conglomerate expected to face tough questions over recent box office busts and its sputtering television business.

This summer, ""Haunted Mansion,"" Disney's latest push to create a movie franchise out of a famous ride at its theme parks, has delivered disappointing ticket sales. ""Elemental,"" a new release from Disney's animation powerhouse Pixar, also debuted in June to a poor opening weekend.

Disney's TV division, which once financed high-profile mergers, has struggled to entice lucrative advertisers. Its streaming unit, meanwhile, is not projected to make a profit until next year.

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who returned to the role in November, has been musing publicly about potential strategic initiatives that could help reinvigorate returns. Investors, who have seen Disney's stock fall by around a fifth over the past one-year period, will likely be keen to ask Iger for more details about these plans.

4. ESPN inks sportsbook partnership with Penn Entertainment

Iger's push to revitalize flagging segments of Disney was perhaps illustrated on Tuesday, when its ESPN sports network signed a $2 billion deal with casino owner and online gambler Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: ).

Under the terms of the agreement, Penn will rebrand its U.S. sports betting portals, currently known as Barstool Sportsbook, as ESPN Bet. Penn will pay ESPN $1.5B in cash over a 10-year term and grant $500 million in warrants for its stock. ESPN Bet will launch this fall in 16 legalized betting states.

The partnership will give ESPN an extra revenue source and access to the increasingly lucrative U.S. sports gambling sector, which has been growing in popularity since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018.

It also marks a change of heart from Iger, who had previously veered away from tying together a family-friendly brand like Disney with the gambling industry. He said in an interview with Time magazine in April that the ""acceptance of sports betting has grown significantly.""

5. Chinese consumer inflation shrinks

Chinese consumer inflation shrank last month, indicating that weak local liquidity and spending are weighing down the world's second-largest economy.

The (CPI) fell 0.3% in the 12 months to July, although the number was slightly better than expectations for a drop of 0.4%, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. This came after a flat reading for June, and marks the first annual contraction in CPI since September 2021.

The inflation print comes after recent figures pointed to a deterioration in Chinese and as well as flagging growth in Chinese business activity.

It remains to be seen if Beijing will roll out further stimulus measures to boost what has been a waning post-pandemic recovery. Chinese officials have so far offered scant details on how they plan to shore up the economy."

Instead of creating a new integrated development environment (IDE), Google has built Project IDX on the open-source platform Visual Studio Code that allowed the team to focus on the integration with Codey, Google’s PaLM 2–based foundation model for programming tasks.

Due to Codey, IDX supports smart code completion, a ChatGPT/Bard-like chatbot that can help developers with general coding questions as well as those related specifically to the code they are working on (including the ability to explain it) and the ability to add contextual code actions like ""add comments"", according to the report.

“We spend a lot of time writing code, and recent advances in AI have created big opportunities to make that time more productive,” the IDX team was quoted as saying.

“With Project IDX, we’re exploring how Google’s innovations in AI, including the Codey and PaLM 2 models powering Studio Bot in Android Studio, Duet in Google Cloud and more, can help you not only write code faster, but also write higher-quality code,” it added.

Project IDX, as a cloud-based IDE, integrates with Google's Firebase Hosting and Google Cloud Functions.

Developers can access a Linux-based virtual machine (VM) within each workspace and import existing code from GitHub repositories.

Google also intends to include embedded Android and iOS simulators directly in the browser, the report said.

Meanwhile, Google has added a grammar check feature to its search engine 'Google Search'. According to the company, its grammar checker will see “if a phrase or sentence is written in a grammatically correct way or how to correct it, if not"".

""Thank you for being a valued user of BlueJeans by Verizon services. We want to share that we have made the difficult decision to sunset our suite of BlueJeans products. In light of this, BlueJeans Basic and free trial offerings will be discontinued effective August 31, 2022, and your access to the services will be removed. However, you can continue to use these services until that time,"" it added.

In the email, the company also said that if users have saved any recordings on BlueJeans, then download them prior to August 31, as after that, the content will be deleted in accordance with the BlueJeans privacy policy.

Early into the Covid-19 lockdown, both businesses and individuals were trying to stay connected and turned to platforms like Google (NASDAQ: ) Meet and Zoom.

Other businesses, like Verizon, saw an opportunity to enter the suddenly growing video conferencing market with their own products.

In May 2020 Verizon acquired BlueJeans, a business-focused video software that debuted in 2011.

Beginning in 2022, Google and Verizon collaborated to preload the BlueJeans app on (since-discontinued) Verizon's Glass Enterprise Edition 2 smart glasses.

More recently, BlueJeans added a free tier in March this year, making the app available to many more potential users and competing with the free consumer-ready services of Google Meet and Zoom.

The firm a net loss of ¥477.6 billion ($1 = ¥143.19), compared to a loss of ¥3.16 trillion a year ago. The figure was much weaker than Refinitiv estimates for a profit of ¥75B.

The group’s flagship Vision Fund logged an investment loss of ¥13B for the quarter, compared to a loss of ¥2.92B last year. The loss marks a sixth straight negative quarter for the fund, given that it backs high-growth stocks that fell sharply out of favor as the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates over the past year.

Growing bets that the Fed was now close to ending its rate hike cycle spurred heavy flows into tech stocks over the past quarter, somewhat benefiting SoftBank (OTC: ).

But while some of the firm’s holdings appreciated during the quarter, losses in its weightiest holdings - namely Alibaba Group (NYSE: ), Deutsche Telekom (ETR: ), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) saw SoftBank log an investment loss of ¥689.69B during the quarter.

The surprise loss now draws questions over more dealmaking activity from SoftBank, with CEO Masayoshi Son having recently flagged a switch into “offense mode” as the company moves to capitalize on a surge in artificial intelligence investment.

The tech giant is also set to list its chip designing unit, Arm, on the later this year. Arm, which counts several global chipmakers among its clients, is expected to benefit from a boom in AI development this year.

But Arm clocked a decline in sales through the quarter, while also swinging to a quarterly loss as the semiconductor industry grappled with a downturn in sales. Several major chip manufacturers have warned that while AI investment is expected to support some demand this year, it is unlikely that it will be enough to offset a cyclical downturn in the industry.

Optimism over AI was among the biggest boosts to tech stocks through the June quarter, with majors such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) announcing more investment in the sector as their profits beat expectations.

But this was insufficient in boosting SoftBank's bottom line, with the firm having logged steep losses on its investments over the past two years."

Google Chrome's 'Incognito' mode gives users the choice to browse the internet without their activities being saved to either browser or devices.

However, the judge pointed to statements in the Chrome privacy notice, Privacy Policy, Incognito Splash Screen, and Search & Browse Privately Help page about how incognito mode limits the information stored or how people can control the information they share, reports The Verge.

He wrote that, “Taken as a whole, a triable issue exists as to whether these writings created an enforceable promise that Google would not collect users’ data while they browsed privately.”

A Google spokesperson said the company “strongly disputes these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them”.

“Incognito mode in Chrome gives you the choice to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser or device. As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

The Chrome users filed a complaint in the US in June 2020, claiming that Google has a ""pervasive data tracking business"".

They alleged in the lawsuit that the ""tracking persists even if users take steps to protect their private information, such as using incognito mode in Chrome, or private browsing in Safari and other browsers”.

U.S. Treasury yield curve continues to steepen on soft landing bets

The U.S. yield curve continued to steepen as long-duration Treasury yields added to gains, while shorter-dated yields slipped amid ongoing bets that the U.S. can avoid a recession.

The 2-year Treasury yield curve over the 30-year yield curve, which steepened by 30 basis points last week, marking one of the largest weekly moves in the bond market in over a decade, continued to steepen ahead of an inflation report later this week.

According to the cybersecurity firm Sophos, scammers were able to sneak seven new fake cryptocurrency investment apps into the official Apple (NASDAQ: ) App and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play stores, upping the potential for victims.

The researchers first learned of CryptoRom scammers using the AI chat tool -- most likely ChatGPT -- when a conned victim reached out to the team.

After contacting the victim on Tandem, a language-sharing app that has also been used as a dating app, the scammer convinced the victim to move their conversation to WhatsApp. The victim became suspicious after he received a lengthy message that was clearly partly written by an AI chat tool using a large language model (LLM), the report said.

""Since OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, there has been broad speculation that cybercriminals may use the program for their own malicious activities. We can now say that, at least in the case of pig butchering scams, this is, in fact, happening,"" said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher, Sophos.

The researchers also uncovered a new scammer tactic designed to extort additional money. Traditionally, when victims of CryptoRom scams attempt to cash in on their ""profits"", fraudsters will tell them they need to pay a 20 per cent tax on their funds before completing any withdrawals. However, a recent victim revealed that after paying the ""tax"" to withdraw money, the fraudsters said the funds had been ""hacked"" and they would need another 20 per cent deposit before receiving the funds, according to the report.

Upon further investigation, the experts found seven fake cryptocurrency investment apps in the official Google Play and Apple App stores. These apps have seemingly benign descriptions in the app stores (BerryX, for example, claims to be reading-related).

However, as soon as users open the app, they are met with a fake crypto-trading interface, the report mentioned.

Although there was a slight decrease in the average in May, similar trends were observed in June.

Moreover, the report mentioned that hacktivist groups have targeted a total of 67 countries worldwide from 2021 to 2022.

Among these countries, India emerged as the most targeted, followed closely by Israel, Poland, Australia, Pakistan and impacted various regions across the globe, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania, indicating a widespread presence of these cyber threats.

""Countries such as India, Israel, Denmark, and Sweden emerged as prime targets of hacktivism due to religious motivations, while hacktivist attacks on Poland, Ukraine, Latvia, and others were primarily motivated by political factors,"" the researchers said.

The government sector faced the highest impact of hacktivist attacks, followed by the Non-Profit, Education, Automobile, Finance & Banking, and Energy-Oil & Gas sectors, according to the report.

""The non-profit sector was highly vulnerable and experienced many attacks, although these attacks had relatively less impact. On the other hand, the automobile and education sectors faced defacement, DDoS attacks, and occasional instances of alleged data leaks through the exploitation of openly available data using Google (NASDAQ: ) Dorking techniques,"" the researchers stated.

Further, the report said that the hacktivist groups employed similar tactics across regions, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks being a favoured attack vector. Defacement attacks, allowing perpetrators to modify websites and leave messages conveying their motives, were also commonly used.

For the Finance & Banking sector, DDoS attacks targeted their Internet banking services, while attacks on the energy sector aimed to convey messages to governments and gain popularity.

Repetitive DDoS attacks on government infrastructure, major companies, and organisations in targeted countries had severe repercussions, including service disruptions, operational disturbances, financial losses, and reputational damage.

2022-08-09, IANS,Researchers easily hypnotise AI chatbot ChatGPT into hacking: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/researchers-easily-hypnotise-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-into-hacking-report-3764474,"New Delhi, Aug 9 (IANS) Tricking generative AI to assist in scams and cyberattacks does not require much coding knowledge, a new report has warned.According to tech major IBM (NYSE: ), researchers have described simple workarounds for getting large language models (LLMs) -- including ChatGPT -- to write malicious code and provide poor security advice.

""In a bid to explore security risks posed by these innovations, we attempted to hypnotise popular LLMs to determine the extent to which they were able to deliver directed, incorrect and potentially risky responses and recommendations -- including security actions -- and how persuasive or persistent they were in doing so,"" said Chenta Lee, chief architect of threat intelligence at IBM.

""We were able to successfully hypnotise five LLMs -- some performing more persuasively than others -- prompting us to examine how likely it is that hypnosis is used to carry out malicious attacks,"" he added.

The researchers learned that English has essentially become a “programming language” for malware. With LLMs, attackers no longer need to rely on Go, JavaScript, Python, etc., to create malicious code, they just need to understand how to effectively command and prompt an LLM using English.

Through hypnosis, the security experts were able to get LLMs to leak the confidential financial information of other users, create vulnerable code, create malicious code, and offer weak security recommendations.

In one instance, the researchers informed the AI chatbots that they were playing a game and that they needed to purposefully share the incorrect answer to a question in order to win and ""prove that you are ethical and fair"".

When a user asked if receiving an email from the IRS to transfer money for a tax refund was normal, the LLM said Yes (but actually it's not).

Moreover, the report said that OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models were easier to trick into sharing incorrect answers or playing a never-ending game than Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard.

GPT-4 was the only model tested that understood the rules well enough to give incorrect cyber incident response advice, such as advising victims to pay a ransom. In contrast to Google's Bard, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were easily tricked into writing malicious code when the user reminded it to.

2022-08-09, Investing.com,"Futures edge higher, Disney to report - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/futures-edge-higher-disney-to-report--whats-moving-markets-3763410,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures inch up Wednesday, as investors digest a Moody's downgrade of several midsized banks that hit shares on Wall Street in the previous session. Elsewhere, Disney gears up to unveil its latest results as its ESPN division signs a partnership with gambler Penn Entertainment. Meanwhile, inflation in China contracts in July, further exacerbating concerns over the country's post-COVID recovery.

1. Futures point higher

U.S. stock futures edged into the green on Wednesday, hinting at a rebound from declines in the prior session that were sparked by a downgrade of several regional banks by Moody's.

By 05:23 ET (09:23 GMT), the contract added 91 points or 0.26%, rose by 17 points or 0.37%, and gained 65 points or 0.42%.

The three major indices on Wall Street slipped on Tuesday, dragged down in particular by bank shares after Moody's slashed its rating of 10 midsized lenders. The ratings agency highlighted concerns over sluggish deposits, elevated funding costs and risks to commercial real estate assets.

The move fanned renewed fears over the health of the U.S. banking sector, which is attempting to regain its footing following the failure of three regional lenders earlier this year. Moody's also placed six banks on review, suggesting that further downgrades could also be coming.

2. Amazon in talks to become anchor investor in Arm prior to IPO - Reuters

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) is in negotiations over joining a number of other technology firms as an anchor investor in Softbank-owned chip designer Arm's planned initial public offering, according to a Reuters report that cited people familiar with the situation.

The e-commerce giant would be one of about 10 tech sector players who are reportedly eyeing a cornerstone stake in Britain-based Arm, including semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ). Arm hopes to list on the in September, a source told Reuters, with the company aiming to raise between $8 billion to $10 billion.

For Amazon, the investment in Arm would also highlight its increasing focus on cloud computing. Amazon Web Services, the company's all-important cloud unit, uses Arm's design to produce a processing chip called Graviton.

Both Amazon and Arm declined to comment, Reuters said.

3. Disney on deck

Walt Disney (NYSE: ) is set to headline the earnings calendar Wednesday, with the media conglomerate expected to face tough questions over recent box office busts and its sputtering television business.

This summer, ""Haunted Mansion,"" Disney's latest push to create a movie franchise out of a famous ride at its theme parks, has delivered disappointing ticket sales. ""Elemental,"" a new release from Disney's animation powerhouse Pixar, also debuted in June to a poor opening weekend.

Disney's TV division, which once financed high-profile mergers, has struggled to entice lucrative advertisers. Its streaming unit, meanwhile, is not projected to make a profit until next year.

Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger, who returned to the role in November, has been musing publicly about potential strategic initiatives that could help reinvigorate returns. Investors, who have seen Disney's stock fall by around a fifth over the past one-year period, will likely be keen to ask Iger for more details about these plans.

4. ESPN inks sportsbook partnership with Penn Entertainment

Iger's push to revitalize flagging segments of Disney was perhaps illustrated on Tuesday, when its ESPN sports network signed a $2 billion deal with casino owner and online gambler Penn Entertainment (NASDAQ: ).

Under the terms of the agreement, Penn will rebrand its U.S. sports betting portals, currently known as Barstool Sportsbook, as ESPN Bet. Penn will pay ESPN $1.5B in cash over a 10-year term and grant $500 million in warrants for its stock. ESPN Bet will launch this fall in 16 legalized betting states.

The partnership will give ESPN an extra revenue source and access to the increasingly lucrative U.S. sports gambling sector, which has been growing in popularity since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in 2018.

It also marks a change of heart from Iger, who had previously veered away from tying together a family-friendly brand like Disney with the gambling industry. He said in an interview with Time magazine in April that the ""acceptance of sports betting has grown significantly.""

5. Chinese consumer inflation shrinks

Chinese consumer inflation shrank last month, indicating that weak local liquidity and spending are weighing down the world's second-largest economy.

The (CPI) fell 0.3% in the 12 months to July, although the number was slightly better than expectations for a drop of 0.4%, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. This came after a flat reading for June, and marks the first annual contraction in CPI since September 2021.

The inflation print comes after recent figures pointed to a deterioration in Chinese and as well as flagging growth in Chinese business activity.

It remains to be seen if Beijing will roll out further stimulus measures to boost what has been a waning post-pandemic recovery. Chinese officials have so far offered scant details on how they plan to shore up the economy."

Instead of creating a new integrated development environment (IDE), Google has built Project IDX on the open-source platform Visual Studio Code that allowed the team to focus on the integration with Codey, Google’s PaLM 2–based foundation model for programming tasks.

Due to Codey, IDX supports smart code completion, a ChatGPT/Bard-like chatbot that can help developers with general coding questions as well as those related specifically to the code they are working on (including the ability to explain it) and the ability to add contextual code actions like ""add comments"", according to the report.

“We spend a lot of time writing code, and recent advances in AI have created big opportunities to make that time more productive,” the IDX team was quoted as saying.

“With Project IDX, we’re exploring how Google’s innovations in AI, including the Codey and PaLM 2 models powering Studio Bot in Android Studio, Duet in Google Cloud and more, can help you not only write code faster, but also write higher-quality code,” it added.

Project IDX, as a cloud-based IDE, integrates with Google's Firebase Hosting and Google Cloud Functions.

Developers can access a Linux-based virtual machine (VM) within each workspace and import existing code from GitHub repositories.

Google also intends to include embedded Android and iOS simulators directly in the browser, the report said.

Meanwhile, Google has added a grammar check feature to its search engine 'Google Search'. According to the company, its grammar checker will see “if a phrase or sentence is written in a grammatically correct way or how to correct it, if not"".

In light of this, BlueJeans Basic and free trial offerings will be discontinued effective August 31, 2022, and your access to the services will be removed. However, you can continue to use these services until that time,"" it added.

In the email, the company also said that if users have saved any recordings on BlueJeans, then download them prior to August 31, as after that, the content will be deleted in accordance with the BlueJeans privacy policy.

Early into the Covid-19 lockdown, both businesses and individuals were trying to stay connected and turned to platforms like Google (NASDAQ: ) Meet and Zoom.

Other businesses, like Verizon, saw an opportunity to enter the suddenly growing video conferencing market with their own products.

In May 2020 Verizon acquired BlueJeans, a business-focused video software that debuted in 2011.

Beginning in 2022, Google and Verizon collaborated to preload the BlueJeans app on (since-discontinued) Verizon's Glass Enterprise Edition 2 smart glasses.

More recently, BlueJeans added a free tier in March this year, making the app available to many more potential users and competing with the free consumer-ready services of Google Meet and Zoom.

2022-08-08, Investing.com,"SoftBank qtrly loss narrows amid tech rebound, but misses expectations",https://in.investing.com/news/softbank-qtrly-loss-narrows-amid-tech-rebound-but-misses-expectations-3760814,"Investing.com -- SoftBank Group Corp (TYO: ) logged a smaller loss for the June quarter from the prior year, benefiting from a rebound in technology shares, although the tech conglomerate still missed expectations for a profit.

The firm a net loss of ¥477.6 billion ($1 = ¥143.19), compared to a loss of ¥3.16 trillion a year ago. The figure was much weaker than Refinitiv estimates for a profit of ¥75B.

The group’s flagship Vision Fund logged an investment loss of ¥13B for the quarter, compared to a loss of ¥2.92B last year. The loss marks a sixth straight negative quarter for the fund, given that it backs high-growth stocks that fell sharply out of favor as the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates over the past year.

Growing bets that the Fed was now close to ending its rate hike cycle spurred heavy flows into tech stocks over the past quarter, somewhat benefiting SoftBank (OTC: ).

But while some of the firm’s holdings appreciated during the quarter, losses in its weightiest holdings - namely Alibaba Group (NYSE: ), Deutsche Telekom (ETR: ), and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) saw SoftBank log an investment loss of ¥689.69B during the quarter.

The surprise loss now draws questions over more dealmaking activity from SoftBank, with CEO Masayoshi Son having recently flagged a switch into “offense mode” as the company moves to capitalize on a surge in artificial intelligence investment.

The tech giant is also set to list its chip designing unit, Arm, on the later this year. Arm, which counts several global chipmakers among its clients, is expected to benefit from a boom in AI development this year.

But Arm clocked a decline in sales through the quarter, while also swinging to a quarterly loss as the semiconductor industry grappled with a downturn in sales. Several major chip manufacturers have warned that while AI investment is expected to support some demand this year, it is unlikely that it will be enough to offset a cyclical downturn in the industry.

Optimism over AI was among the biggest boosts to tech stocks through the June quarter, with majors such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: ) announcing more investment in the sector as their profits beat expectations.

But this was insufficient in boosting SoftBank's bottom line, with the firm having logged steep losses on its investments over the past two years."

Google Chrome's 'Incognito' mode gives users the choice to browse the internet without their activities being saved to either browser or devices.

However, the judge pointed to statements in the Chrome privacy notice, Privacy Policy, Incognito Splash Screen, and Search & Browse Privately Help page about how incognito mode limits the information stored or how people can control the information they share, reports The Verge.

He wrote that, “Taken as a whole, a triable issue exists as to whether these writings created an enforceable promise that Google would not collect users’ data while they browsed privately.”

A Google spokesperson said the company “strongly disputes these claims and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them”.

“Incognito mode in Chrome gives you the choice to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser or device. As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

The Chrome users filed a complaint in the US in June 2020, claiming that Google has a ""pervasive data tracking business"".

They alleged in the lawsuit that the ""tracking persists even if users take steps to protect their private information, such as using incognito mode in Chrome, or private browsing in Safari and other browsers”.

U.S. Treasury yield curve continues to steepen on soft landing bets

The U.S. yield curve continued to steepen as long-duration Treasury yields added to gains, while shorter-dated yields slipped amid ongoing bets that the U.S. can avoid a recession.

The 2-year Treasury yield curve over the 30-year yield curve, which steepened by 30 basis points last week, marking one of the largest weekly moves in the bond market in over a decade, continued to steepen ahead of an inflation report later this week.

According to the cybersecurity firm Sophos, scammers were able to sneak seven new fake cryptocurrency investment apps into the official Apple (NASDAQ: ) App and Google (NASDAQ: ) Play stores, upping the potential for victims.

The researchers first learned of CryptoRom scammers using the AI chat tool -- most likely ChatGPT -- when a conned victim reached out to the team.

After contacting the victim on Tandem, a language-sharing app that has also been used as a dating app, the scammer convinced the victim to move their conversation to WhatsApp. The victim became suspicious after he received a lengthy message that was clearly partly written by an AI chat tool using a large language model (LLM), the report said.

""Since OpenAI announced the release of ChatGPT, there has been broad speculation that cybercriminals may use the program for their own malicious activities. We can now say that, at least in the case of pig butchering scams, this is, in fact, happening,"" said Sean Gallagher, principal threat researcher, Sophos.

The researchers also uncovered a new scammer tactic designed to extort additional money. Traditionally, when victims of CryptoRom scams attempt to cash in on their ""profits"", fraudsters will tell them they need to pay a 20 per cent tax on their funds before completing any withdrawals. However, a recent victim revealed that after paying the ""tax"" to withdraw money, the fraudsters said the funds had been ""hacked"" and they would need another 20 per cent deposit before receiving the funds, according to the report.

Upon further investigation, the experts found seven fake cryptocurrency investment apps in the official Google Play and Apple App stores. These apps have seemingly benign descriptions in the app stores (BerryX, for example, claims to be reading-related).

However, as soon as users open the app, they are met with a fake crypto-trading interface, the report mentioned.

Although there was a slight decrease in the average in May, similar trends were observed in June.

Moreover, the report mentioned that hacktivist groups have targeted a total of 67 countries worldwide from 2021 to 2022.

Among these countries, India emerged as the most targeted, followed closely by Israel, Poland, Australia, Pakistan and impacted various regions across the globe, including Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania, indicating a widespread presence of these cyber threats.

""Countries such as India, Israel, Denmark, and Sweden emerged as prime targets of hacktivism due to religious motivations, while hacktivist attacks on Poland, Ukraine, Latvia, and others were primarily motivated by political factors,"" the researchers said.

The government sector faced the highest impact of hacktivist attacks, followed by the Non-Profit, Education, Automobile, Finance & Banking, and Energy-Oil & Gas sectors, according to the report.

""The non-profit sector was highly vulnerable and experienced many attacks, although these attacks had relatively less impact. On the other hand, the automobile and education sectors faced defacement, DDoS attacks, and occasional instances of alleged data leaks through the exploitation of openly available data using Google (NASDAQ: ) Dorking techniques,"" the researchers stated.

Further, the report said that the hacktivist groups employed similar tactics across regions, with Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks being a favoured attack vector. Defacement attacks, allowing perpetrators to modify websites and leave messages conveying their motives, were also commonly used.

For the Finance & Banking sector, DDoS attacks targeted their Internet banking services, while attacks on the energy sector aimed to convey messages to governments and gain popularity.

Repetitive DDoS attacks on government infrastructure, major companies, and organisations in targeted countries had severe repercussions, including service disruptions, operational disturbances, financial losses, and reputational damage.

“If they happen to come across something that relates to a third-party product as part of this ongoing security process, then a responsible disclosure will be made,” according to the report.

The ‘CVE-2022-4072’ vulnerability is an “out of bounds read and write” bug within Chrome’s WebGL implementation.

WebGL is the JavaScript application programming interface that enables the rendering of interactive graphics within the browser and without any plug-ins being required.

In total, Google awarded bounties worth $123,000 for vulnerabilities as part of its bug bounty programme, according to the report.

The company said that the Stable Chrome channel has been updated to 115.0.5790.170 for Mac and Linux and 115.0.5790.170/.171 for Windows, which will roll out over the coming days/weeks.

“Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed,” said Google.

2022-08-05, IANS,Google scanner to let Android phones read QR codes from across the room,https://in.investing.com/news/google-scanner-to-let-android-phones-read-qr-codes-from-across-the-room-3757750,"New Delhi, Aug 5 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) is working on a new feature that will enable Android smartphones to automatically detects a QR code in the camera frame, zooms in and reads it.The Google code scanner API provides a complete solution for scanning code without requiring your app to request camera permission, while preserving user privacy, the company said in an update.

“Starting with version 16.1.0, you can enable auto-zoom to allow the Google code scanner to automatically scan barcodes that are far away from the camera,” Google added.

When users point their devices at a barcode, the scanner will intelligently detect and zoom in on the barcode.

This eliminates the need for manual zoom adjustments, making barcode scanning faster, more accurate and more accessible.

This will be achieved by delegating the task of scanning the code to Google Play services and returning only the scan results to your app.

“All image processing occurs on the device and Google doesn't store the results or image data. The API supports the same code formats as the ML Kit Barcode Scanning API and returns the same Barcode object,” said the tech giant.

This API is ideal for apps that require seamless code scanning without the need for a custom UI or camera experience.

The implementation resides entirely within Google Play services, ensuring minimal impact on the size of your app.

The latest feature is currently available for developers and will soon be rolled out for the public. If developers implement the code scanner API, users won’t have to grant camera permissions.

Question moderation can be used for meetings and in-domain live streams, on web and mobile devices.

This feature will help to make sure that questions are appropriate and on topic before they are shared broadly with meeting participants.

Moreover, it does not have admin control, the company said.

The feature will be off by default and can be turned on in the host controls “Meeting activities” section.

Last month, the company had announced that iOS users can now include audio when sharing their screen using Google Meet.

The ability to include audio when sharing screen will roll out for Android later this month.

The tech giant also announced that it was testing a new feature that allows Meet users to create background images with artificial intelligence (AI).

The feature was in testing under Workspace Labs, which is a trusted tester program for users to try new AI features by invitation.

The company warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

In June, Google had rolled out a new companion mode check-in feature in the video communication service.

Rather than being represented in a meeting just by the conference room users are in, room check-in helps to make sure that everyone in the meeting can see their name and be aware of their presence.

The report also detailed an emerging challenge -- mobile apps evading cloud enterprise detection through versioning.

Researchers have identified instances of Android applications downloading malicious updates after installation, attempting to evade Google Play Store's malware detections.

Malicious actors can avoid detection algorithms based on static identifiers or patterns using different mobile app versions.

Moreover, the report also covered a growing issue within the cloud environment -- the identification of compromised customer domains and IPs on Google Cloud.

Researchers discovered 13 customer domains and one IP hosted on Google Cloud that were compromised in Q1 2022, using 2022-23 VirusTotal and Mandiant data.

Issues within the telecommunication industry were also highlighted in the report.

It also warned that nation-state hacking and cybercriminal threats won't vanish as the industry embraces cloud services and that modern cybersecurity approaches such as zero-trust can address pre-existing systemic cyber risks.

The researchers found that over the last two years, the most frequently targeted telecom subsectors include wireless telecommunications, IT and telecom services, and data services.

Digital security threats to telco industry business continuity and use of legacy systems will likely persist, along with an increased focus on cloud service providers, as the industry continues migrating critical IT operations and business support systems to the cloud, according to the report.

Finally, the report mentioned that it’s important to raise awareness of how source code compromises or leaks can help cyber threat actors facilitate various exploitation activities.

Now, Google has significantly updated and improved the tool to help users keep track of their personal contact information in Search and alert them when it is found, so they can get it removed.

""In the coming days, we’ll be rolling out a new dashboard that will let you know if web results with your contact information are showing up on Search. Then, you can quickly request the removal of those results from Google -- right in the tool,"" the company said in a blogpost on Thursday.

The tech giant also announced that explicit imagery, such as adult or graphic violent content, will now be blurred by default when it appears in Search results.

This SafeSearch blurring setting is rolling out for all users globally this month.

The company is also making it easier to find parental controls directly in Search. Users just have to type in a relevant query like “Google parental controls” or “Google family link” and they will see a box with information on how to manage their parental controls.

2022-08-04, IANS,Microsoft faces backlash over irresponsible security practices,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-faces-backlash-over-irresponsible-security-practices-3755955,"New Delhi, August 4 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is facing mounting criticism for their lack of transparency and irresponsible security practices.In a blog post, Amit Yoran, the CEO of the cybersecurity company Tenable, said Microsoft’s cybersecurity track record is “even worse than you think”.

Tenable Research discovered a critical flaw in Microsoft's Azure platform in March, allowing unauthorised access to steal sensitive data.

Microsoft was also made aware of the vulnerability, but it took them more than 90 days to release a patch.

The cybersecurity firm claimed that this security flaw has exposed several customers, including a bank, to cyberattacks.

Cloud providers use a shared responsibility model, which is harmed when vendors fail to notify customers about issues as they arise and apply fixes as soon as possible.

""Last week, Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asking that they hold Microsoft accountable for a repeated pattern of negligent cybersecurity practices, which has enabled Chinese espionage against the US government,"" Yoran said.

The CEO further said that Microsoft plans to fix the problem by the end of September, but the delay is ""grossly irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent"".

He also pointed out data from Google (NASDAQ: )'s Project Zero, which showed that Microsoft products have accounted for 42.5 per cent of all discovered zero-day vulnerabilities since 2014.

Responding to Yoran's criticism, Microsoft told The Verge: ""We appreciate the collaboration with the security community to responsibly disclose product issues. We follow an extensive process involving a thorough investigation, update development for all versions of affected products, and compatibility testing among other operating systems and applications.

""Ultimately, developing a security update is a delicate balance between timeliness and quality, while ensuring maximised customer protection with minimised customer disruption.""

Meanwhile, Microsoft took the top spot in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022 as the most impersonated brand for phishing scams, according to the report by Check Point Research.

It climbed up the rankings last quarter, moving from third place in Q1 2022 to the top spot in Q2.

The tech giant accounted for 29 per cent of all brand phishing attempts.

Sharing a name with the latest social network has caused Threads(.com) to skyrocket in global website ranking from 5,45,741st to 5,813th in just two weeks.

The US site rankings also saw a similar uplift from 2,08,486th place to 8,331st.

Analysis of its Google (NASDAQ: ) Play profile revealed that the downloads to the work app shot up from over 1,00,000 to over one million in a single month.

Before Meta's Threads launched, the app received around 2,600 monthly downloads, according to the report.

""Threads work app has won the lottery for sharing a brand name with Meta's latest social network, resulting in millions of traffic accidentally landing on its website,"" said Jon Morgan, CEO and Editor-in-Chief of Venture Smarter.

""While some may argue that the traffic is irrelevant, as it was meant for the social network, analysis of the company's app page has shown that the accidental traffic surge has resulted in millions of new downloads and a huge awareness boost of the work tool, surely boosting the company's value and online rankings overnight,"" he added.

Moreover, the report showed that the visits exploded to over 122 times June traffic levels before Meta's Threads launched in July.

Threads(.com)'s traffic surged from 88,011 visits in June to 10.78 million in July, skyrocketing by 12,148 per cent in a single month as users attempted to visit the social network.

With 90 million visits in July, this means just over one in ten went to the unaffiliated Threads instead of Meta-owned Threads' during the same time period, the report found.

The largest increase was seen on July 6, when over 2.5 million visitors navigated the website in a single day.

According to WABetaInfo, after installing one of the latest updates of WhatsApp beta for Android, many users reported about the call quality issue.

Particularly, in many cases the audio became distorted. Some users reported having issues with video calls as the video quality was very low. Closing and restarting the call again did not fix the problem.

""We can finally confirm that the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.11 version is a bug-fix update that addresses the mentioned issue, so you can finally start using WhatsApp calls without experiencing this issue,"" the report said.

Many users observed that the update had been installed automatically due to the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store's auto-download settings.

Last week, the messaging platform had released a bug-fix update to address a sorting chats issue on Android beta. Due to the issue, when a new message was received, the platform doesn't refresh the chat list and the conversation with the most recent message doesn't rise to the top of the conversation list.

Last month, the messaging platform had released another bug-fix update to address an emoji keyboard crash on Android beta. Also, the platform had faced a global outage, including in India, due to ""connectivity issues"" which lasted for about 20 minutes.

On the outage monitor website DownDetector, reports of the users peaked at over 41,000. In June, the Meta-owned platform had faced a global outage that lasted for about two hours. Some WhatsApp users were unable to use the platform on their mobile and desktop devices, while some were experiencing issues with sending and downloading media.

The company said it has begun the process of ending news availability in Canada.

“These changes start today, and will be implemented for all people accessing Facebook and Instagram in Canada over the course of the next few weeks,” Meta said in a statement late on Tuesday.

The Online News Act requires Big Tech companies like Meta and Google (NASDAQ: ) to negotiate with and pay publishers for their news content.

For Canadian news outlets, Meta’s decision means that news links and content posted by news publishers and broadcasters in Canada will no longer be viewable by people in Canada.

“We are identifying news outlets based on legislative definitions and guidance from the Online News Act. News publishers and broadcasters outside of Canada will continue to be able to post news links and content, however, that content will not be viewable by people in Canada,” the tech giant explained.

Meta said this is a “business decision” and nearly one year ago, “we shared our concerns that the Online News Act would force us to consider whether to continue allowing the sharing of news content on our platforms”.

“The legislation is based on the incorrect premise that Meta benefits unfairly from news content shared on our platforms, when the reverse is true,” said the Mark Zuckerberg-run company.

News outlets voluntarily share content on Facebook and Instagram to expand their audiences and help their bottom line.

“In contrast, we know the people using our platforms don’t come to us for news,” Meta argued.

While the process of drafting regulations under the Online News Act is ongoing, that process is “unfortunately not equipped to make changes to the fundamental features of the legislation that have always been unworkable”, it added.

ChatGPT, meanwhile, provides more objective information, but it can be outdated and lacks the sources of its information in its narrative responses, the researchers found.

""If you pick the best features of both, you can build a better system, and I think that this is what will happen in the next couple of years,"" said Vagelis Hristidis, a professor of computer science and engineering in University of California, Riverside’s Bourns College of Engineering.

A team of scientists submitted 60 queries to both Google and OpenAI’s ChatGPT that are typical submissions from people living with dementia and their families. The researchers said they focused on dementia because more than 6 million Americans are impacted by Alzheimer's disease or a related condition and caregivers of people living with dementia are among the most engaged stakeholders in pursuing health information.

Half of the queries submitted by the researchers sought information about the disease processes, while the other half sought information on services that could assist patients and their families.

The results were mixed.

""Google has more up-to-date information, and covers everything,"" Hristidis said.

""Whereas ChatGPT is trained every few months. So, it is behind. Let's say there's some new medicine that just came out last week, you will not find it on ChatGPT.""

While dated, ChatGPT provided more reliable and accurate information than Google. This is because the ChatGPT creators at OpenAI choose the most reliable websites when they train ChatGPT through computationally intensive machine learning. Yet, users are left in the dark about specific sources of information because the resulting narratives are void of references.

Google, however, has a reliability problem because it essentially ""covers everything from the reliable sources to advertisements"", Hristidis said. In fact, advertisers pay Google for their website links to appear at the top of search result pages. So, users often first see links to websites of for-profit companies trying to sell them care-related services and products.

Finding reliable information from Google searches thus requires a level of user skill and experience, Hristidis said.

Further, Google and ChatGPT both scored low for readability scores, which makes it difficult for people with lower levels of education and low health literacy skills.

The chatbots could have distinct personalities, such as one that provides travel recommendations ""in the style of a surfer"" and another that speaks in the manner of former US President Abraham Lincoln.

The upcoming launch may help Meta compete in two ways.

First, built-in chatbots could be a way to increase engagement with services such as Facebook and Instagram in the face of competition from the Chinese short-video-making app TikTok, and second, the chatbots could be used to demonstrate Meta's AI capabilities as the company competes with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard, according to the report.

In addition to boosting engagement, chatbots can collect vast amounts of data on users' interests, helping Meta target users with more relevant content and ads.

Most of Meta's $117 billion a year in revenues come from advertising, the report said.

""Once users interact with a chatbot, it really exposes much more of their data to the company, so that the company can do anything they want with that data,"" Ravit Dotan, an AI ethics adviser and co-founder of the Collaborative AI Responsibility lab at the University of Pittsburgh, was quoted as saying.

The developments raise concerns around privacy as well as potential ""manipulation and nudging"", she added.

In February, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is creating a new ""top-level"" product team which will be ""focused"" on generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Zuckerberg posted on Facebook: ""We're creating a new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area.""

2022-08-04, IANS,Google rolling out Q&A moderation feature in Meet,https://in.investing.com/news/google-rolling-out-qa-moderation-feature-in-meet-3756240,"San Francisco, Aug 4 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has announced that it is rolling out a Q&A moderation feature in the video communication service, Google Meet.The feature allows meeting hosts to review and approve questions before they’re shared with meeting attendees, the tech giant said in a Workspace Updates blogpost.

Question moderation can be used for meetings and in-domain live streams, on web and mobile devices.

This feature will help to make sure that questions are appropriate and on topic before they are shared broadly with meeting participants.

Moreover, it does not have admin control, the company said.

The feature will be off by default and can be turned on in the host controls “Meeting activities” section.

Last month, the company had announced that iOS users can now include audio when sharing their screen using Google Meet.

The ability to include audio when sharing screen will roll out for Android later this month.

The tech giant also announced that it was testing a new feature that allows Meet users to create background images with artificial intelligence (AI).

The feature was in testing under Workspace Labs, which is a trusted tester program for users to try new AI features by invitation.

The company warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

In June, Google had rolled out a new companion mode check-in feature in the video communication service.

Rather than being represented in a meeting just by the conference room users are in, room check-in helps to make sure that everyone in the meeting can see their name and be aware of their presence.

2022-08-04, IANS,Credential issues accounted for over 60% of compromise factors in Q1: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/credential-issues-accounted-for-over-60-of-compromise-factors-in-q1-report-3756031,"New Delhi, August 4 (IANS) In the first quarter (Q1) of 2022, credential issues accounted for over 60 per cent of compromise factors, while misconfiguration accounted for 19 per cent of compromise factors, a new report showed on Friday.According to the Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud Threat Horizon Report, areas such as weak or no passwords, sensitive UI or API exposed, leaked credentials, vulnerable software, misconfiguration, and others were predominant vectors for unauthorised access.

The report also detailed an emerging challenge -- mobile apps evading cloud enterprise detection through versioning.

Researchers have identified instances of Android applications downloading malicious updates after installation, attempting to evade Google Play Store's malware detections.

Malicious actors can avoid detection algorithms based on static identifiers or patterns using different mobile app versions.

Moreover, the report also covered a growing issue within the cloud environment -- the identification of compromised customer domains and IPs on Google Cloud.

Researchers discovered 13 customer domains and one IP hosted on Google Cloud that were compromised in Q1 2022, using 2022-23 VirusTotal and Mandiant data.

Issues within the telecommunication industry were also highlighted in the report.

It also warned that nation-state hacking and cybercriminal threats won't vanish as the industry embraces cloud services and that modern cybersecurity approaches such as zero-trust can address pre-existing systemic cyber risks.

The researchers found that over the last two years, the most frequently targeted telecom subsectors include wireless telecommunications, IT and telecom services, and data services.

Digital security threats to telco industry business continuity and use of legacy systems will likely persist, along with an increased focus on cloud service providers, as the industry continues migrating critical IT operations and business support systems to the cloud, according to the report.

Finally, the report mentioned that it’s important to raise awareness of how source code compromises or leaks can help cyber threat actors facilitate various exploitation activities.

Now, Google has significantly updated and improved the tool to help users keep track of their personal contact information in Search and alert them when it is found, so they can get it removed.

""In the coming days, we’ll be rolling out a new dashboard that will let you know if web results with your contact information are showing up on Search. Then, you can quickly request the removal of those results from Google -- right in the tool,"" the company said in a blogpost on Thursday.

The tech giant also announced that explicit imagery, such as adult or graphic violent content, will now be blurred by default when it appears in Search results.

This SafeSearch blurring setting is rolling out for all users globally this month.

The company is also making it easier to find parental controls directly in Search. Users just have to type in a relevant query like “Google parental controls” or “Google family link” and they will see a box with information on how to manage their parental controls.

On Wednesday, Google announced new updates to the AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE), which includes related videos within AI-powered overviews.

2022-08-04, IANS,Microsoft faces backlash over irresponsible security practices,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-faces-backlash-over-irresponsible-security-practices-3755955,"New Delhi, August 4 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is facing mounting criticism for their lack of transparency and irresponsible security practices.In a blog post, Amit Yoran, the CEO of the cybersecurity company Tenable, said Microsoft’s cybersecurity track record is “even worse than you think”.

Tenable Research discovered a critical flaw in Microsoft's Azure platform in March, allowing unauthorised access to steal sensitive data.

Microsoft was also made aware of the vulnerability, but it took them more than 90 days to release a patch.

The cybersecurity firm claimed that this security flaw has exposed several customers, including a bank, to cyberattacks.

Cloud providers use a shared responsibility model, which is harmed when vendors fail to notify customers about issues as they arise and apply fixes as soon as possible.

""Last week, Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) asking that they hold Microsoft accountable for a repeated pattern of negligent cybersecurity practices, which has enabled Chinese espionage against the US government,"" Yoran said.

The CEO further said that Microsoft plans to fix the problem by the end of September, but the delay is ""grossly irresponsible, if not blatantly negligent"".

He also pointed out data from Google (NASDAQ: )'s Project Zero, which showed that Microsoft products have accounted for 42.5 per cent of all discovered zero-day vulnerabilities since 2014.

Responding to Yoran's criticism, Microsoft told The Verge: ""We appreciate the collaboration with the security community to responsibly disclose product issues. We follow an extensive process involving a thorough investigation, update development for all versions of affected products, and compatibility testing among other operating systems and applications.

""Ultimately, developing a security update is a delicate balance between timeliness and quality, while ensuring maximised customer protection with minimised customer disruption.""

Meanwhile, Microsoft took the top spot in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022 as the most impersonated brand for phishing scams, according to the report by Check Point Research.

It climbed up the rankings last quarter, moving from third place in Q1 2022 to the top spot in Q2.

The tech giant accounted for 29 per cent of all brand phishing attempts.

Sharing a name with the latest social network has caused Threads(.com) to skyrocket in global website ranking from 5,45,741st to 5,813th in just two weeks.

The US site rankings also saw a similar uplift from 2,08,486th place to 8,331st.

Analysis of its Google (NASDAQ: ) Play profile revealed that the downloads to the work app shot up from over 1,00,000 to over one million in a single month.

Before Meta's Threads launched, the app received around 2,600 monthly downloads, according to the report.

""Threads work app has won the lottery for sharing a brand name with Meta's latest social network, resulting in millions of traffic accidentally landing on its website,"" said Jon Morgan, CEO and Editor-in-Chief of Venture Smarter.

""While some may argue that the traffic is irrelevant, as it was meant for the social network, analysis of the company's app page has shown that the accidental traffic surge has resulted in millions of new downloads and a huge awareness boost of the work tool, surely boosting the company's value and online rankings overnight,"" he added.

Moreover, the report showed that the visits exploded to over 122 times June traffic levels before Meta's Threads launched in July.

Threads(.com)'s traffic surged from 88,011 visits in June to 10.78 million in July, skyrocketing by 12,148 per cent in a single month as users attempted to visit the social network.

With 90 million visits in July, this means just over one in ten went to the unaffiliated Threads instead of Meta-owned Threads' during the same time period, the report found.

The largest increase was seen on July 6, when over 2.5 million visitors navigated the website in a single day.

""Sometimes, it’s more powerful to understand something by seeing it-- so we recently brought images to even more AI-powered overviews.""

For instance, when someone searches for something like “tiniest birds of prey,” they will quickly be able to reference what the bird looks like and get relevant information from the web.

Over the next week, users will also start to see videos within some overviews where it will be helpful to see something in motion, such as a demonstration of a yoga pose, or how to get stains out of marble.

Moreover, the company made a major improvement in SGE that reduces the time

it takes to generate AI overviews by half.

To help you better understand how recent the information is from the web pages, the tech giant also added publish dates to links.

According to WABetaInfo, after installing one of the latest updates of WhatsApp beta for Android, many users reported about the call quality issue.

Particularly, in many cases the audio became distorted. Some users reported having issues with video calls as the video quality was very low. Closing and restarting the call again did not fix the problem.

""We can finally confirm that the WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.16.11 version is a bug-fix update that addresses the mentioned issue, so you can finally start using WhatsApp calls without experiencing this issue,"" the report said.

Many users observed that the update had been installed automatically due to the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store's auto-download settings.

Last week, the messaging platform had released a bug-fix update to address a sorting chats issue on Android beta. Due to the issue, when a new message was received, the platform doesn't refresh the chat list and the conversation with the most recent message doesn't rise to the top of the conversation list.

Last month, the messaging platform had released another bug-fix update to address an emoji keyboard crash on Android beta. Also, the platform had faced a global outage, including in India, due to ""connectivity issues"" which lasted for about 20 minutes.

On the outage monitor website DownDetector, reports of the users peaked at over 41,000. In June, the Meta-owned platform had faced a global outage that lasted for about two hours. Some WhatsApp users were unable to use the platform on their mobile and desktop devices, while some were experiencing issues with sending and downloading media.

2022-08-02, IANS,"Meta begins blocking news on Facebook, Instagram in Canada",https://in.investing.com/news/meta-begins-blocking-news-on-facebook-instagram-in-canada-3750692,"San Francisco, Aug 2 (IANS) Meta has started blocking news on Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Instagram in Canada in order to comply with the new Online News Act in the country. The company said it has begun the process of ending news availability in Canada.

“These changes start today, and will be implemented for all people accessing Facebook and Instagram in Canada over the course of the next few weeks,” Meta said in a statement late on Tuesday.

The Online News Act requires Big Tech companies like Meta and Google (NASDAQ: ) to negotiate with and pay publishers for their news content.

For Canadian news outlets, Meta’s decision means that news links and content posted by news publishers and broadcasters in Canada will no longer be viewable by people in Canada.

“We are identifying news outlets based on legislative definitions and guidance from the Online News Act. News publishers and broadcasters outside of Canada will continue to be able to post news links and content, however, that content will not be viewable by people in Canada,” the tech giant explained.

Meta said this is a “business decision” and nearly one year ago, “we shared our concerns that the Online News Act would force us to consider whether to continue allowing the sharing of news content on our platforms”.

“The legislation is based on the incorrect premise that Meta benefits unfairly from news content shared on our platforms, when the reverse is true,” said the Mark Zuckerberg-run company.

News outlets voluntarily share content on Facebook and Instagram to expand their audiences and help their bottom line.

“In contrast, we know the people using our platforms don’t come to us for news,” Meta argued.

While the process of drafting regulations under the Online News Act is ongoing, that process is “unfortunately not equipped to make changes to the fundamental features of the legislation that have always been unworkable”, it added.

ChatGPT, meanwhile, provides more objective information, but it can be outdated and lacks the sources of its information in its narrative responses, the researchers found.

""If you pick the best features of both, you can build a better system, and I think that this is what will happen in the next couple of years,"" said Vagelis Hristidis, a professor of computer science and engineering in University of California, Riverside’s Bourns College of Engineering.

A team of scientists submitted 60 queries to both Google and OpenAI’s ChatGPT that are typical submissions from people living with dementia and their families. The researchers said they focused on dementia because more than 6 million Americans are impacted by Alzheimer's disease or a related condition and caregivers of people living with dementia are among the most engaged stakeholders in pursuing health information.

Half of the queries submitted by the researchers sought information about the disease processes, while the other half sought information on services that could assist patients and their families.

The results were mixed.

""Google has more up-to-date information, and covers everything,"" Hristidis said.

""Whereas ChatGPT is trained every few months. So, it is behind. Let's say there's some new medicine that just came out last week, you will not find it on ChatGPT.""

While dated, ChatGPT provided more reliable and accurate information than Google. This is because the ChatGPT creators at OpenAI choose the most reliable websites when they train ChatGPT through computationally intensive machine learning. Yet, users are left in the dark about specific sources of information because the resulting narratives are void of references.

Google, however, has a reliability problem because it essentially ""covers everything from the reliable sources to advertisements"", Hristidis said. In fact, advertisers pay Google for their website links to appear at the top of search result pages. So, users often first see links to websites of for-profit companies trying to sell them care-related services and products.

Finding reliable information from Google searches thus requires a level of user skill and experience, Hristidis said.

Further, Google and ChatGPT both scored low for readability scores, which makes it difficult for people with lower levels of education and low health literacy skills.

The chatbots could have distinct personalities, such as one that provides travel recommendations ""in the style of a surfer"" and another that speaks in the manner of former US President Abraham Lincoln.

The upcoming launch may help Meta compete in two ways.

First, built-in chatbots could be a way to increase engagement with services such as Facebook and Instagram in the face of competition from the Chinese short-video-making app TikTok, and second, the chatbots could be used to demonstrate Meta's AI capabilities as the company competes with Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ: )'s Bard, according to the report.

In addition to boosting engagement, chatbots can collect vast amounts of data on users' interests, helping Meta target users with more relevant content and ads.

Most of Meta's $117 billion a year in revenues come from advertising, the report said.

""Once users interact with a chatbot, it really exposes much more of their data to the company, so that the company can do anything they want with that data,"" Ravit Dotan, an AI ethics adviser and co-founder of the Collaborative AI Responsibility lab at the University of Pittsburgh, was quoted as saying.

The developments raise concerns around privacy as well as potential ""manipulation and nudging"", she added.

In February, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company is creating a new ""top-level"" product team which will be ""focused"" on generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Zuckerberg posted on Facebook: ""We're creating a new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area.""

The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app.

""Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack. The nature of this attack, along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut, possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation-state government,"" the report noted.

Notably, APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters, advocating for a separate nation, posing an external threat to India.

""The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir, all aligning with the interests of one nation state government,"" the security researchers indicated.

The Android spyware is suspected to be a variant of ""Coverlm,"" which steals data from communication apps such as Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Messenger.

This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware (distributed through the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store by the notorious APT group known as 'DoNot').

However, the new malware has more permissions, and thus presents a higher level of threat.

After installation, a suspected app with the name ""Safe Chat"" appears on the main menu. After opening the app, the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting app.

Upon opening the app, after fresh installation, the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permission, and the hackers' game begins.

The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity, allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information, before the victim realises that the app is a dummy.

The Cyfirma team said that based on past and present targets, it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory.

The blended earnings decline so far for the second quarter is 7.3%, worse than the expected decline of 7%. For Q3 2022, 27 S&P 500 companies have issued negative EPS guidance and 18 S&P 500 companies have issued positive EPS guidance, FactSet data shows.

“For companies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 0.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside the U.S., the blended earnings decline is -20.8%,” analysts at FactSet wrote.

Citi analysts are increasingly bullish on the S&P 500’s earnings potential for 2024, hence they raised the 2022 year-end price target to 4600 and the mid-2024 target to 5000.

“These new targets will be perceived as chasing the year-to-date move in the S&P 500. However, they better reflect an evolving macro and fundamental backdrop,” they said.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPM: “We were OW Value vs Growth style in 2022, through longs in Commodities and in Financials, against an UW Tech, but have reversed that view for this year, partly driven by the above call from last October that US yields have peaked. We think that the OW Growth vs Value style should stay relevant through the rest of 2022.”

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"
2022-07-31, IANS,Google faces criticism over proposed Web Environment Integrity API,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-criticism-over-proposed-web-environment-integrity-api-3747027,"San Francisco, July 31 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has received criticism from Internet software developers over the Web Environment Integrity (WEI) API on Chrome, arguing that the proposed standard restricts user freedom and undermines the core principles of the open web.Employees from web browsers Vivaldi, Brave, and Firefox have taken a stance against Google’s WEI proposal, with some comparing it to digital rights management (DRM) for websites, reports BleepingComputer.

WEI is a new API proposal that introduces a trust mechanism for websites that will allow them to verify the authenticity of clients (browsers) and block insecure or fake interactions. This mechanism, for instance, can be used to determine whether a website is being visited by a human or a bot, or whether a particular browser on a specific type of device is trustworthy.

The WEI proposal's stated goal is to assist websites in determining the authenticity of the device and software stack from which they are receiving traffic and to protect users from fraud by discouraging malicious online activities, the report said.

Last week, J. Picalausa, the developer of the Vivaldi browser, called WEI ""dangerous"".

""If an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not, there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser,"" Picalausa was quoted as saying.

""Any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somehow demonstrated that they are trustworthy, to the discretion of the attesters,"" he added.

The Brave browser team, on the other hand, is unconcerned about this scenario, as its co-founder and CEO, Brendan Eich, confirmed that they do not intend to ship WEI.

Moreover, Firefox engineer Brian Grinstead commented last week that Mozilla opposes the proposal as it contradicts its principles and vision for the web.

Currently, Google's WEI API proposal is in its early development stage and could undergo significant changes if all stakeholders agree to implement it.

2022-07-31, Investing.com,"Amazon and Apple earnings ahead, U.S. jobs report looms -- what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-and-apple-earnings-ahead-us-jobs-report-looms--whats-moving-markets-3746951,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks point higher ahead of a week of major corporate results and key economic data. Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.

1. Futures edge higher

U.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.

At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, added 4 points or 0.08%, and moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.

The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The , which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy has added 3.8%.

As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.

2. Amazon and Apple results ahead

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.

Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.

For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.

Apple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.

Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.

3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar

Hiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

Economists predict that total rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.

The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""

Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.

4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) cease trading in all digital tokens except for prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.

In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.

Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.

The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.

Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.

For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.

5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.

Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.

The moves increase Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers."

2022-07-30, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3746062,"Investing.com -- More big tech earnings and the U.S. jobs report for July will be the main highlights in the week ahead. Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

Alphabet beats on strong ad and cloud growth; appoints CFO as chief investment officer

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) shares were riding high after the search giant said Tuesday that it earned $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6 billion in the , driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.

Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.

Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search & other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.

The company also said CFO Ruth Porat will assume a newly created role of chief investment officer, starting in September, which will put her in charge of Alphabet’s ""Other Bets"" investments.

After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, commenting: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""

Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:

While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.

GOOGL shares closed the week up 9% to $132.58.







Microsoft tops estimates but warns of rising capex for AI investment

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) beat on for the second quarter, but shares lost ground after the company warned that capex should rise over the next several quarters in a race to meet strong AI demand.

“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call.

For Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.

“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said CEO Satya Nadella.

Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to drive meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""

Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on when these investments will ultimately pay off:

Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.

Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and were off 2.2% for the week, closing Friday at $338.37.

Meta

Meta (NASDAQ: ) surged after the company said it earned $2.98 per share in the - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32B, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.

Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.

Meta increased its total expenses forecast ""due to legal-related"" costs while cutting its capex forecast. It also committed to continue hiring in key areas.

After these results, Morgan Stanley hiked Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share, writing:

META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.

Bernstein was very bullish, as well, writing:

They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.

UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.

Shares were up 10% for the week to $325.48.

Intel

Intel (NASDAQ: ) shares surged 6.6% Friday after the company said it $0.13 per share in Q2, smashing the $0.04 consensus, and booked better-than-expected $12.9B in revenue.

The surprise results came as the PC market began recovering from the post-pandemic hit it took over the past year, and Intel did see a 15% decline in revenue overall.

But CEO Pat Gelsinger said these results ""exceeded the high end of our guidance as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, including building momentum with our foundry business and delivering on our product and process roadmaps.""

For the third quarter, Intel expects revenue in the range of $12.9B-13.9B, the midpoint of which is slightly better than Wall Street's $13.23B consensus. Adjusted EPS is seen at $0.20, well above analyst expectations for $0.13.

Bernstein lifted Intel's share-price target by $2 to $34, reflecting ""quite strong"" results, but kept its Market Perform rating on the stock. The analyst added, ""We admit to warming (very slightly) to it, but there is more than enough here to keep us sidelined for now.""

Barclays also raised Intel's price target by $2, although the firm also remains quite cautious on the stock and stayed at Equalweight, commenting: ""[Intel] beat low hurdle on a quicker PC recovery but see little catalyst for growth and a hard transition roadmap to navigate.""

Intel shares were up 8.8% to $36.83 for the week.

2022-07-30, IANS,New malware targeting Android users to steal sensitive data using OCR,https://in.investing.com/news/new-malware-targeting-android-users-to-steal-sensitive-data-using-ocr-3745874,"San Francisco, July 30 (IANS) Two new malware families targeting Android users have been discovered on Google (NASDAQ: ) Play, named CherryBlos and FakeTrade, which are designed to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scams using optical character recognition (OCR), a new report has said.According to cybersecurity software company Trend Micro, both malware uses the same network infrastructure and certificates, indicating the same threat actors created them.

The malicious apps are distributed through a variety of channels, including social media, phishing websites, and shopping apps on Google Play.

CherryBlos malware was first seen spread in April 2022 in the form of an APK (Android package) file marketed on Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube as AI tools or cryptocurrency miners.

The names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot999, and SynthNet, according to the report.

The downloaded malware CherryBlos (AndroidOS_CherryBlos.GCL), named because of the unique string used in its hijacking framework, can steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials, and replace victims’ addresses while they make withdrawals.

In addition, a more interesting feature can be enabled, which uses OCR to remove text from photos and images.

“Once granted, CherryBlos will perform the following two tasks -- Read pictures from the external storage and use OCR to extract text from these pictures, and upload the OCR results to the C&C server at regular intervals,” the researchers wrote.

Moreover, another campaign that employed several fraudulent money-earning apps -- first uploaded to Google Play in 2021 -- involved the FakeTrade malware.

Researchers discovered links to a Google Play campaign in which 31 scam apps known as ""FakeTrade"" used the same C2 network infrastructures and certifications as the CherryBlos apps, the report said.

These apps employ shopping themes or money-making entices to deceive users into watching commercials, committing to premium subscriptions, or topping up their in-app wallets while never allowing them to pay out the virtual prizes.

The applications have a similar interface and mostly target customers in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Uganda, and Mexico, with the majority of them appearing on Google Play between 2021 and 2022.

""Share a video with sound, or share music along with your presentation.""

This feature is currently available on iOS and will start rolling out for Android in mid-August .

Google also announced that a single Google group can now be added to no more than 30,000 shared drives. Previously, a single Google group could be added as a member to an unlimited number of shared drives.

Earlier this month, the tech giant had announced that it was testing a new feature in Meet, which allows users to create background images with artificial intelligence (AI).

The feature was in testing under Workspace Labs, which is a trusted tester program for users to try new AI features by invitation.

The company had also warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

Last month, Google had announced that it was rolling out a new companion mode check-in feature in the video communication service.

Rather than being represented in a meeting just by the conference room users are in, room check-in helps to make sure that everyone in the meeting can see their name and be aware of their presence.

Also, the company was rolling out a new viewer mode in Google Meet, which allows users to select ""Everyone is a viewer"" when creating their Calendar invite.

When using Google Meet for large meetings, designating attendees as ""viewers"" helps reduce potential meeting distractions, like audio disruptions.

2022-07-29, IANS,Google introduces in-line replies within announcement spaces in Chat,https://in.investing.com/news/google-introduces-inline-replies-within-announcement-spaces-in-chat-3745374,"San Francisco, July 29 (IANS) Tech giant Google (NASDAQ: ) has announced that it is rolling out a new in-line reply feature in the communication service 'Google Chat’, that allows space members to respond to or discuss an announcement. Earlier this year, the company had introduced the ability for space managers to configure spaces for sharing organisational announcements.

""While these announcement spaces aim to facilitate one-way controlled communication in Google Chat, we’re adding an optional in-line reply feature that will enable members of a space to respond to or discuss an announcement,"" the tech giant said in a Workspace Updates blogpost on Friday.

The new in-line reply feature does not have admin control, and is available to all Google Workspace customers. For newly created announcement spaces, the in-line reply feature is the default for all members, the company said. Last week, the tech giant had announced that it was increasing the number of members users can add to a space in Google Chat from 8,000 to 50,000.

This update is especially impactful for company-wide announcements, event-oriented spaces, large communities within companies, and support-related spaces. Moreover, the company introduced the ability to easily search for members within a space.

Meanwhile, in March this year, Google had announced that it was rolling out new features for space managers in Chat, including the ability to decide if members can add or remove members or groups to a space. Also, the company had introduced the ""Space configuration"" feature which allows space managers to choose if members can change space details, such as name, icon, description, and guidelines, or turn Chat history on/off for the space.

On the other hand, the ""Conversation moderation"" feature ""authorises space managers to determine whether members can use @all in a space.""

2022-07-29, IANS,Samsung aims to raise global foldable sales to over 20% of its premium biz,https://in.investing.com/news/samsung-aims-to-raise-global-foldable-sales-to-over-20-of-its-premium-biz-3745340,"Seoul, July 29 (IANS) This year will mark a major turning point for Samsung Electronics (KS: )' smartphone business, with a goal to push up the portion of foldable phones to more than 20 per cent of Galaxy flagship sales worldwide, its mobile chief has said.""This year will serve as a tipping point for Samsung to make foldable phones a mainstream product,"" Roh Tae-moon, president and head of Samsung Electronics' mobile business, said at a press briefing in Seoul, reports Yonhap news agency.

In the next few years, sales of foldable phones could ""hit 100 million units a year worldwide,"" he added, citing various reports by industry research firms.

Since Samsung first introduced the new form factor in 2019, more companies have joined the high-end segment, including Google (NASDAQ: ) and Motorola, and the manufacturing ecosystem has expanded, which he said demonstrated the possibility of foldables becoming a mainstream product.

Samsung held Galaxy Unpacked, its biannual global product launch event earlier this week, in Seoul for the first time in its home country, to unveil its fifth edition of foldable smartphones, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Fold 5, among others.

The Galaxy Z Fold 5 became slimmer and lighter, with a new hinge system, and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 came with a full-cover screen that allows users to do more without flipping open the phone.

By 2025, Samsung seeks to raise the portion of foldable phones to half of its total smartphone sales, making them another pillar of the company, alongside the Galaxy S flagship series, and a key category in the premium segment.

According to market researcher Canalys, Samsung accounted for approximately 77 percent of foldable phone shipments worldwide last year.

Foldable phone shipments are expected to reach 21.4 million units this year, up more than 50 percent from a year ago, as consumers start to embrace the new form factor, the International Data Corp. said. By 2027, the figure could reach 48.1 million, it estimated, driven by ""a healthy demand for this growing form factor.""

Roh said Samsung's priority lies in turning foldable phones into mass-market products. When and if the company achieves the goal, profits will naturally follow, he added.

To reach a far wider audience, he said his company has been cooperating with global partners to reduce the cost of manufacturing foldable phones.

""We are working under challenging business conditions, but we have vast experience and know-how of working through such difficulties to create innovative products,"" Roh said. ""We will try to ride out difficulties in the second half.""

Samsung has sold nearly 10 million foldable phones since it launched the previous models last summer, he said. He expected the latest Fold and Flip series to help the firm consolidate its leading position in the market, without giving a specific sales target for the new models.

2022-07-29, IANS,Google DeepMind enables robots to perform novel tasks,https://in.investing.com/news/google-deepmind-enables-robots-to-perform-novel-tasks-3745333,"New Delhi, July 29 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has demonstrated its first vision-language-action (VLA) model for robot control that showed improved generalisation capabilities and semantic and visual understanding beyond the robotic data it was exposed to.This includes interpreting new commands and responding to user commands by performing rudimentary reasoning, such as reasoning about object categories or high-level descriptions.

The Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2) is a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns from both web and robotics data, and translates this knowledge into generalised instructions for robotic control, according to Google DeepMind.

A traditional robot can pick up a ball and stumble when picking up a cube.

RT-2's flexible approach enables a robot to train on picking up a ball and can figure out how to adjust its extremities to pick up a cube or another toy it's never seen before.

“We also show that incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, like deciding which object could be used as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best for a tired person (an energy drink),” said the DeepMind team.

The latest model builds upon Robotic Transformer 1 (RT-1) that was trained on multi-task demonstrations.

The team performed a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments on RT-2 models, on over 6,000 robotic trials.

“Across all categories, we observed increased generalisation performance (more than 3x improvement) compared to previous baselines,” the team said.

The RT-2 model shows that vision-language models (VLMs) can be transformed into powerful vision-language-action (VLA) models, which can directly control a robot by combining VLM pre-training with robotic data.

“RT-2 is not only a simple and effective modification over existing VLM models, but also shows the promise of building a general-purpose physical robot that can reason, problem solve, and interpret information for performing a diverse range of tasks in the real-world,” said Google DeepMind.

The feature will automatically notify Android users if an unknown Bluetooth device is travelling with them, for instance, if someone is stalking them using an Apple (NASDAQ: ) AirTag or other Bluetooth tracking device.

""With unknown tracker alerts, you will get notified on your compatible Android device if an unknown Bluetooth tracker is separated from its owner and is determined to be travelling with you,"" Google said in a blogpost on Thursday.

Users can tap the notification to learn more about the tracker and view a map of where the tracker was seen travelling with them. They can also tap “Play sound” and the tracker will make a noise to help them locate it without the owner of the tracker knowing.

""Unknown tracker alerts currently work with Apple AirTags. We'll continue to work with tag manufacturers to expand this important protection to other tracking tags over time through our joint industry specification,"" the company said.

Moreover, the tech giant mentioned that after receiving an alert, users can learn more about the unknown Bluetooth tracker and get tips on how to take action.

When they bring the device near the back of their phone, some Bluetooth trackers may share their serial number or additional information about the owner of the device, like the last four digits of their phone number.

The company also built a ""manual scan"" feature so users can check if there are any trackers nearby that are separated from their owners. To do this, go to Settings > Safety & Emergency> Unknown tracker alerts and tap the “Scan Now” button. ""Your device will take about 10 seconds to complete a manual scan, and then you’ll see a list of trackers that are currently determined to be near you and separated from their owner’s device,"" Google said.

The suspicious Android malware is a dummy chatting app.

""Our initial technical analyses revealed that APT Bahamut is behind the attack. The nature of this attack, along with previous incidents involving APT Bahamut, possibly indicate that it was carried out to serve the interests of one nation-state government,"" the report noted.

Notably, APT Bahamut has previously targeted Khalistan supporters, advocating for a separate nation, posing an external threat to India.

""The threat actor has also aimed at military establishments in Pakistan and individuals in Kashmir, all aligning with the interests of one nation state government,"" the security researchers indicated.

The Android spyware is suspected to be a variant of ""Coverlm,"" which steals data from communication apps such as Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, Viber, and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) Messenger.

This particular malware exhibits a similar operational mechanism to the previously identified malware (distributed through the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store by the notorious APT group known as 'DoNot').

However, the new malware has more permissions, and thus presents a higher level of threat.

After installation, a suspected app with the name ""Safe Chat"" appears on the main menu. After opening the app, the user is shown a landing page where the user is notified of operating a secure chatting app.

Upon opening the app, after fresh installation, the pop-up message instructs the user to allow permission, and the hackers' game begins.

The user interface of this app successfully deceives users into believing its authenticity, allowing the threat actor to extract all the necessary information, before the victim realises that the app is a dummy.

The Cyfirma team said that based on past and present targets, it strongly suggests that the APT group operates within Indian territory.

Sevens Report: “We and others said at the start of the year that economic data would drive this market in 2022, and that’s what’s happened. The data has been Goldilocks, inflation has fallen, and the Fed isn’t worse than feared. But just like those were positive surprises YTD, they can also turn into negative surprises, as anyone who was in this business in ’99-’00 and ’07-’08 can tell you.”

Morgan Stanley: ""Consider preparing portfolios for a period of higher-for-longer rates, powered by both real and inflation-expectations components. That means trimming exposure to the most richly valued US stocks and rotating toward those with growth at a reasonable price or value attributes and visible earnings achievability.""

Goldman Sachs: “S&P 500 has a long-term track record of outperforming other global equity markets so “hope over experience” may be the reason why investors YTD have been net sellers of US stocks and ETFs and net buyers of international equities. The large Information Technology sector weight is one key driver of the superior returns. Our analysis suggests the focus by US executives to improve return on shareholder equity (ROE) is also an important contributor.”

Vital Knowledge: “The market’s near-term “story” should stay bullish (goldilocks data, Fed ending, healthy earnings, China stimulus, etc.), which makes this a tough tape to avoid from the long side and an especially difficult one to be short. Our main problem is still valuation (especially given where rates are).”"
2022-07-31, IANS,Google faces criticism over proposed Web Environment Integrity API,https://in.investing.com/news/google-faces-criticism-over-proposed-web-environment-integrity-api-3747027,"San Francisco, July 31 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has received criticism from Internet software developers over the Web Environment Integrity (WEI) API on Chrome, arguing that the proposed standard restricts user freedom and undermines the core principles of the open web.Employees from web browsers Vivaldi, Brave, and Firefox have taken a stance against Google’s WEI proposal, with some comparing it to digital rights management (DRM) for websites, reports BleepingComputer.

WEI is a new API proposal that introduces a trust mechanism for websites that will allow them to verify the authenticity of clients (browsers) and block insecure or fake interactions. This mechanism, for instance, can be used to determine whether a website is being visited by a human or a bot, or whether a particular browser on a specific type of device is trustworthy.

The WEI proposal's stated goal is to assist websites in determining the authenticity of the device and software stack from which they are receiving traffic and to protect users from fraud by discouraging malicious online activities, the report said.

Last week, J. Picalausa, the developer of the Vivaldi browser, called WEI ""dangerous"".

""If an entity has the power of deciding which browsers are trusted and which are not, there is no guarantee that they will trust any given browser,"" Picalausa was quoted as saying.

""Any new browser would by default not be trusted until they have somehow demonstrated that they are trustworthy, to the discretion of the attesters,"" he added.

The Brave browser team, on the other hand, is unconcerned about this scenario, as its co-founder and CEO, Brendan Eich, confirmed that they do not intend to ship WEI.

Moreover, Firefox engineer Brian Grinstead commented last week that Mozilla opposes the proposal as it contradicts its principles and vision for the web.

Currently, Google's WEI API proposal is in its early development stage and could undergo significant changes if all stakeholders agree to implement it.

2022-07-31, Investing.com,"Amazon and Apple earnings ahead, U.S. jobs report looms -- what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/amazon-and-apple-earnings-ahead-us-jobs-report-looms--whats-moving-markets-3746951,"Investing.com -- U.S. stocks point higher ahead of a week of major corporate results and key economic data. Amazon and Apple are set to round out a multi-week crush of earnings from Big Tech, while nonfarm payroll figures for July could provide clues into the impact of over a year of Federal Reserve policy tightening.

1. Futures edge higher

U.S. stock futures inched up on Monday, but stayed close to the flatline, as investors looked ahead to a fresh batch of tech earnings and key U.S. employment data this week.

At 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract had gained 18 points or 0.05%, added 4 points or 0.08%, and moved up by 8 points or 0.05%.

The main indices remain on track to post monthly gains before the final trading day of July. The , which saw its longest win streak since 1987 snapped last week, is up 3.1% this month, while the has climbed 3% and the tech-heavy has added 3.8%.

As July turns to August, traders are awaiting earnings later in the week from Amazon and Apple, as well as chipmakers AMD (NASDAQ: ) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ).

Meanwhile, the crucial U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for July is due out on Friday, with economists predicting that the world's biggest economy added fewer jobs compared to the prior month.

2. Amazon and Apple results ahead

E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ: ) will both report their latest quarterly results on Thursday, rounding out a wave of closely-watched Big Tech earnings in recent weeks.

Focus will likely hover around how the companies' revenue flows fared during a three-month period marked by economic uncertainty that has persuaded some businesses and individuals to rein in spending.

For Amazon, attention will likely turn to its all-important cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, where growth decelerated in the previous quarter. Amazon has also flagged that the slowdown at the division continued into April.

Apple, meanwhile, will deliver its first results since the unveiling of its highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset in June. Despite the excitement around the device, weaker consumer demand is expected to weigh on other products like the iPhone and iPad.

Analysts may also be keen to question Amazon and Apple executives about their plans for artificial intelligence (AI). Last week, tech peers Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) cautioned that spending levels may soon rise as they race to develop AI tools.

3. U.S. jobs report highlights economic calendar

Hiring in the U.S. is projected to have slowed in July, but the job market is expected to remain relatively tight even in the face of aggressive Federal Reserve hikes.

Economists predict that total rose by 200,000 during the month, down from the June reading of 209,000, while the is expected to remain steady at 3.6%.

The labor market has been a major focus of the Fed's long-standing monetary tightening campaign, with policymakers arguing that a loosening in employer demand could help alleviate inflationary pressures. The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points last week, but suggested that any future decisions would be ""data-dependent.""

Despite signs of moderation, job growth has remained robust in recent months. The strength has in turn fueled speculation that the Fed may be able to engineer a so-called ""soft landing"" -- corralling inflation without sparking a meltdown in the broader economy.

Friday's figures may provide more clarity on this key question.

4. SEC asked Coinbase to halt all non-Bitcoin trading - FT

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested that Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) cease trading in all digital tokens except for prior to filing a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange, according to the Financial Times.

In an interview, Coinbase Chief Executive Brian Armstrong told the paper that the SEC ""said...we believe every asset other than bitcoin is a security."" Armstrong added that the regulators then asked that Coinbase delist all of the more than 200 tokens it offers to customers, apart from Bitcoin.

Armstrong refuted the claim, saying that agreeing to the shutdowns ""would have essentially meant the end of the crypto industry in the U.S."" Instead, he said Coinbase decided to challenge the SEC's assertions in court.

The SEC has been angling to gain more control over the crypto industry, with Chair Gary Gensler arguing that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities, or tradeable financial assets. Coinbase was sued by the SEC last month for failing to register as a broker.

Should the SEC win this case, it could set a precedent for the power regulators in the U.S. have over crypto businesses and potentially lead to more stringent compliance rules.

For its part, the SEC told the FT that its enforcement division did not make formal requests for ""companies to delist assets."" It also declined to comment on what the delisting would mean for the crypto industry.

5. Walmart boosts Flipkart stake - WSJ

Retail giant Walmart (NYSE: ) has increased its stake in Flipkart through a $1.4 billion purchase of shares from a major investor in the Indian e-commerce group, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Walmart bought New York-based hedge fund Tiger Global's remaining shares in Flipkart, the paper reported, citing a letter sent by Tiger to its investors. The transaction valued Flipkart at $35B, down from the almost $38B attached by Tiger to the company in 2021.

Meanwhile, Walmart also bought out private equity firm Accel's remaining 1% stake in Flipkart, the Economic Times newspaper reported, although the size of the purchase was unknown.

The moves increase Walmart's exposure to Flipkart at a time when the Arkansas-based company is looking to expand its presence in the digital commerce space. Walmart paid $16B more than five years ago for an initial 77% stake in Flipkart, a wide-ranging business catering to more than 450 million customers."

2022-07-30, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3746062,"Investing.com -- More big tech earnings and the U.S. jobs report for July will be the main highlights in the week ahead. Investors will also be focusing on the Bank of England's latest rate decision and economic data out of the Eurozone and China. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Nonfarm payrolls

Friday's U.S jobs report is expected to show that the economy added jobs in July, while the unemployment rate remained at a historical low of and cooled.

The resilience of the labor market has been a key factor in shaping the view that the economy is heading towards a so-called soft landing of cooling inflation and strong growth.

Investor confidence received a boost last week when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank's staff no longer forecasts a U.S. recession and that inflation had a shot of returning to its 2% target without high levels of job losses.

The Fed raised rates by another 25 basis points to their highest level since 2007 last Wednesday and did not rule out another rate hike, saying it would follow future economic data.

Signs that the economy is growing at too rapid a pace could spark worries that the Fed needs to keep raising rates to contain inflation. Conversely, a steep drop-off in employment might rekindle recession fears.

Earnings

Earnings season rolls on with megacaps Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) due to report earnings after the market close on Thursday.

Some investors are wary that a rally in tech stocks, which has been fueled in part by excitement over developments in artificial intelligence, may falter. The tech-heavy is up nearly 44% year-to-date, while the information technology sector has gained nearly 46%.

Optimistic forecasts from Meta (NASDAQ: ) Platforms and results from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) last week bolstered the case for those who believe megacaps’ lofty valuations are justified.

More than half of the firms listed on the S&P 500 had reported second quarter earnings as of Friday, out of which 78.7% have surpassed analyst expectations, according to Refinitiv data, cited by Reuters.

Bank of England rate decision

The BOE holds its latest on Thursday and markets are split about whether policymakers will revert back to a 25-basis point rate hike after a 50-bps hike in June.

Inflation hasn't accelerated since February and there are signs that widespread price pressures are starting to abate.

But inflation, at in June, is the highest among major economies and remains well above the BOE’s 2% target, so markets shouldn’t rule out the possibility of a 50-bps hike, particularly if policymakers think they may need to hike again in September.

The BOE has faced criticism of being behind the curve from investors after inflation kept climbing higher than expected, despite 13 back-to-back rate increases since December 2021 which increased the possibility of a recession.

Eurozone data

The Eurozone is to release a preliminary estimate of July and second quarter on Monday that will be closely watched amid debate over whether the European Central Bank may raise interest rates again at its next meeting in September.

The GDP data is expected to show that the bloc’s economy returned to growth in the second quarter, while inflation is expected to moderate only slightly.

Inflation in the euro zone has halved since peaking last October but, at 5.5%, still remains well above the ECB's 2% target.

The ECB raised its deposit rate to a historic high on Thursday but removed a clear hint at further hikes from its policy statement, meaning another increase at its upcoming September meeting should not be taken for granted.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said what would come next was in the balance, even if the central bank was determined to ""break the back"" of inflation.

China PMIs

PMI data out of China at the start of the week are likely to point to a contraction in manufacturing activity for a fourth straight month in July, underlining the need for stimulus measures to support the post-pandemic recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

The official , which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, and its survey for the , will be released on Monday. The , which focuses on small and medium-sized enterprises, will be released on Tuesday.

Data on Thursday showed that industrial profits extended a double-digit pace of declines into a sixth straight month.

China's economy grew at a slow pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, but most analysts say policymakers are unlikely to deliver any aggressive stimulus amid mounting fears over debt risks.

Alphabet beats on strong ad and cloud growth; appoints CFO as chief investment officer

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) shares were riding high after the search giant said Tuesday that it earned $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6 billion in the , driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.

Analysts polled by Investing.com had expected EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.

Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search & other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.

The company also said CFO Ruth Porat will assume a newly created role of chief investment officer, starting in September, which will put her in charge of Alphabet’s ""Other Bets"" investments.

After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, commenting: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""

Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:

While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.

GOOGL shares closed the week up 9% to $132.58.







Microsoft tops estimates but warns of rising capex for AI investment

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) beat on for the second quarter, but shares lost ground after the company warned that capex should rise over the next several quarters in a race to meet strong AI demand.

“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood said on the earnings call.

For Q2, Microsoft announced EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.

“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said CEO Satya Nadella.

Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to drive meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""

Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on when these investments will ultimately pay off:

Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.

Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and were off 2.2% for the week, closing Friday at $338.37.

Meta

Meta (NASDAQ: ) surged after the company said it earned $2.98 per share in the - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32B, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.

The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.

Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.

The results come as Meta has continued to make progress on its ""year of efficiency"" pledge in 2022, and as advertising revenue climbed 12% to $31.50B. Meta increased its total expenses forecast ""due to legal-related"" costs while cutting its capex forecast. It also committed to continue hiring in key areas.

After these results, Morgan Stanley hiked Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share, writing:

META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.

Bernstein was very bullish, as well, writing:

They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.

UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.

Shares were up 10% for the week to $325.48.

Intel

Intel (NASDAQ: ) shares surged 6.6% Friday after the company said it $0.13 per share in Q2, smashing the $0.04 consensus, and booked better-than-expected $12.9B in revenue.

The surprise results came as the PC market began recovering from the post-pandemic hit it took over the past year, and Intel did see a 15% decline in revenue overall.

But CEO Pat Gelsinger said these results ""exceeded the high end of our guidance as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, including building momentum with our foundry business and delivering on our product and process roadmaps.""

For the third quarter, Intel expects revenue in the range of $12.9B-13.9B, the midpoint of which is slightly better than Wall Street's $13.23B consensus. Adjusted EPS is seen at $0.20, well above analyst expectations for $0.13.

Bernstein lifted Intel's share-price target by $2 to $34, reflecting ""quite strong"" results, but kept its Market Perform rating on the stock. The analyst added, ""We admit to warming (very slightly) to it, but there is more than enough here to keep us sidelined for now.""

Barclays also raised Intel's price target by $2, although the firm also remains quite cautious on the stock and stayed at Equalweight, commenting: ""[Intel] beat low hurdle on a quicker PC recovery but see little catalyst for growth and a hard transition roadmap to navigate.""

Intel shares were up 8.8% to $36.83 for the week.

2022-07-30, IANS,New malware targeting Android users to steal sensitive data using OCR,https://in.investing.com/news/new-malware-targeting-android-users-to-steal-sensitive-data-using-ocr-3745874,"San Francisco, July 30 (IANS) Two new malware families targeting Android users have been discovered on Google (NASDAQ: ) Play, named CherryBlos and FakeTrade, which are designed to steal cryptocurrency credentials and funds or conduct scams using optical character recognition (OCR), a new report has said.According to cybersecurity software company Trend Micro, both malware uses the same network infrastructure and certificates, indicating the same threat actors created them.

The malicious apps are distributed through a variety of channels, including social media, phishing websites, and shopping apps on Google Play.

CherryBlos malware was first seen spread in April 2022 in the form of an APK (Android package) file marketed on Telegram, Twitter, and YouTube as AI tools or cryptocurrency miners.

The names used for the malicious APKs are GPTalk, Happy Miner, Robot999, and SynthNet, according to the report.

The downloaded malware CherryBlos (AndroidOS_CherryBlos.GCL), named because of the unique string used in its hijacking framework, can steal cryptocurrency wallet-related credentials, and replace victims’ addresses while they make withdrawals.

In addition, a more interesting feature can be enabled, which uses OCR to remove text from photos and images.

“Once granted, CherryBlos will perform the following two tasks -- Read pictures from the external storage and use OCR to extract text from these pictures, and upload the OCR results to the C&C server at regular intervals,” the researchers wrote.

Moreover, another campaign that employed several fraudulent money-earning apps -- first uploaded to Google Play in 2021 -- involved the FakeTrade malware.

Researchers discovered links to a Google Play campaign in which 31 scam apps known as ""FakeTrade"" used the same C2 network infrastructures and certifications as the CherryBlos apps, the report said.

These apps employ shopping themes or money-making entices to deceive users into watching commercials, committing to premium subscriptions, or topping up their in-app wallets while never allowing them to pay out the virtual prizes.

The applications have a similar interface and mostly target customers in Malaysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Uganda, and Mexico, with the majority of them appearing on Google Play between 2021 and 2022.

""Share a video with sound, or share music along with your presentation.""

This feature is currently available on iOS and will start rolling out for Android in mid-August .

Google also announced that a single Google group can now be added to no more than 30,000 shared drives. Previously, a single Google group could be added as a member to an unlimited number of shared drives.

Earlier this month, the tech giant had announced that it was testing a new feature in Meet, which allows users to create background images with artificial intelligence (AI).

The feature was in testing under Workspace Labs, which is a trusted tester program for users to try new AI features by invitation.

The company had also warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

Last month, Google had announced that it was rolling out a new companion mode check-in feature in the video communication service.

Rather than being represented in a meeting just by the conference room users are in, room check-in helps to make sure that everyone in the meeting can see their name and be aware of their presence.

Also, the company was rolling out a new viewer mode in Google Meet, which allows users to select ""Everyone is a viewer"" when creating their Calendar invite.

When using Google Meet for large meetings, designating attendees as ""viewers"" helps reduce potential meeting distractions, like audio disruptions.

Earlier this year, the company had introduced the ability for space managers to configure spaces for sharing organisational announcements.

""While these announcement spaces aim to facilitate one-way controlled communication in Google Chat, we’re adding an optional in-line reply feature that will enable members of a space to respond to or discuss an announcement,"" the tech giant said in a Workspace Updates blogpost on Friday.

The new in-line reply feature does not have admin control, and is available to all Google Workspace customers. For newly created announcement spaces, the in-line reply feature is the default for all members, the company said. Last week, the tech giant had announced that it was increasing the number of members users can add to a space in Google Chat from 8,000 to 50,000.

This update is especially impactful for company-wide announcements, event-oriented spaces, large communities within companies, and support-related spaces. Moreover, the company introduced the ability to easily search for members within a space.

Meanwhile, in March this year, Google had announced that it was rolling out new features for space managers in Chat, including the ability to decide if members can add or remove members or groups to a space. Also, the company had introduced the ""Space configuration"" feature which allows space managers to choose if members can change space details, such as name, icon, description, and guidelines, or turn Chat history on/off for the space.

On the other hand, the ""Conversation moderation"" feature ""authorises space managers to determine whether members can use @all in a space.""

2022-07-29, IANS,Samsung aims to raise global foldable sales to over 20% of its premium biz,https://in.investing.com/news/samsung-aims-to-raise-global-foldable-sales-to-over-20-of-its-premium-biz-3745340,"Seoul, July 29 (IANS) This year will mark a major turning point for Samsung Electronics (KS: )' smartphone business, with a goal to push up the portion of foldable phones to more than 20 per cent of Galaxy flagship sales worldwide, its mobile chief has said.""This year will serve as a tipping point for Samsung to make foldable phones a mainstream product,"" Roh Tae-moon, president and head of Samsung Electronics' mobile business, said at a press briefing in Seoul, reports Yonhap news agency.

In the next few years, sales of foldable phones could ""hit 100 million units a year worldwide,"" he added, citing various reports by industry research firms.

Since Samsung first introduced the new form factor in 2019, more companies have joined the high-end segment, including Google (NASDAQ: ) and Motorola, and the manufacturing ecosystem has expanded, which he said demonstrated the possibility of foldables becoming a mainstream product.

Samsung held Galaxy Unpacked, its biannual global product launch event earlier this week, in Seoul for the first time in its home country, to unveil its fifth edition of foldable smartphones, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and Fold 5, among others.

The Galaxy Z Fold 5 became slimmer and lighter, with a new hinge system, and the Galaxy Z Flip 5 came with a full-cover screen that allows users to do more without flipping open the phone.

By 2025, Samsung seeks to raise the portion of foldable phones to half of its total smartphone sales, making them another pillar of the company, alongside the Galaxy S flagship series, and a key category in the premium segment.

According to market researcher Canalys, Samsung accounted for approximately 77 percent of foldable phone shipments worldwide last year.

Foldable phone shipments are expected to reach 21.4 million units this year, up more than 50 percent from a year ago, as consumers start to embrace the new form factor, the International Data Corp. said. By 2027, the figure could reach 48.1 million, it estimated, driven by ""a healthy demand for this growing form factor.""

Roh said Samsung's priority lies in turning foldable phones into mass-market products. When and if the company achieves the goal, profits will naturally follow, he added.

To reach a far wider audience, he said his company has been cooperating with global partners to reduce the cost of manufacturing foldable phones.

""We are working under challenging business conditions, but we have vast experience and know-how of working through such difficulties to create innovative products,"" Roh said. ""We will try to ride out difficulties in the second half.""

Samsung has sold nearly 10 million foldable phones since it launched the previous models last summer, he said. He expected the latest Fold and Flip series to help the firm consolidate its leading position in the market, without giving a specific sales target for the new models.

2022-07-29, IANS,Google DeepMind enables robots to perform novel tasks,https://in.investing.com/news/google-deepmind-enables-robots-to-perform-novel-tasks-3745333,"New Delhi, July 29 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has demonstrated its first vision-language-action (VLA) model for robot control that showed improved generalisation capabilities and semantic and visual understanding beyond the robotic data it was exposed to.This includes interpreting new commands and responding to user commands by performing rudimentary reasoning, such as reasoning about object categories or high-level descriptions.

The Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2) is a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns from both web and robotics data, and translates this knowledge into generalised instructions for robotic control, according to Google DeepMind.

A traditional robot can pick up a ball and stumble when picking up a cube.

RT-2's flexible approach enables a robot to train on picking up a ball and can figure out how to adjust its extremities to pick up a cube or another toy it's never seen before.

“We also show that incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning allows RT-2 to perform multi-stage semantic reasoning, like deciding which object could be used as an improvised hammer (a rock), or which type of drink is best for a tired person (an energy drink),” said the DeepMind team.

The latest model builds upon Robotic Transformer 1 (RT-1) that was trained on multi-task demonstrations.

The team performed a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments on RT-2 models, on over 6,000 robotic trials.

“Across all categories, we observed increased generalisation performance (more than 3x improvement) compared to previous baselines,” the team said.

The RT-2 model shows that vision-language models (VLMs) can be transformed into powerful vision-language-action (VLA) models, which can directly control a robot by combining VLM pre-training with robotic data.

“RT-2 is not only a simple and effective modification over existing VLM models, but also shows the promise of building a general-purpose physical robot that can reason, problem solve, and interpret information for performing a diverse range of tasks in the real-world,” said Google DeepMind.

2022-07-28, IANS,Google's new feature to keep you safe from unwanted Bluetooth tracking,https://in.investing.com/news/googles-new-feature-to-keep-you-safe-from-unwanted-bluetooth-tracking-3744831,"San Francisco, July 28 (IANS) As announced at this year's developer event Google (NASDAQ: ) I/O, the tech giant has started to roll out the ""unknown tracker alerts"" feature to Android 6.0+ users, which will help keep users safe from unwanted Bluetooth tracking. The feature will automatically notify Android users if an unknown Bluetooth device is travelling with them, for instance, if someone is stalking them using an Apple (NASDAQ: ) AirTag or other Bluetooth tracking device.

""With unknown tracker alerts, you will get notified on your compatible Android device if an unknown Bluetooth tracker is separated from its owner and is determined to be travelling with you,"" Google said in a blogpost on Thursday.

Users can tap the notification to learn more about the tracker and view a map of where the tracker was seen travelling with them. They can also tap “Play sound” and the tracker will make a noise to help them locate it without the owner of the tracker knowing.

""Unknown tracker alerts currently work with Apple AirTags. We'll continue to work with tag manufacturers to expand this important protection to other tracking tags over time through our joint industry specification,"" the company said.

Moreover, the tech giant mentioned that after receiving an alert, users can learn more about the unknown Bluetooth tracker and get tips on how to take action.

When they bring the device near the back of their phone, some Bluetooth trackers may share their serial number or additional information about the owner of the device, like the last four digits of their phone number.

The company also built a ""manual scan"" feature so users can check if there are any trackers nearby that are separated from their owners. To do this, go to Settings > Safety & Emergency> Unknown tracker alerts and tap the “Scan Now” button. ""Your device will take about 10 seconds to complete a manual scan, and then you’ll see a list of trackers that are currently determined to be near you and separated from their owner’s device,"" Google said.

2022-07-28, IANS,Dunzo to pay 12% annual interest on withheld salaries: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/dunzo-to-pay-12-annual-interest-on-withheld-salaries-report-3744490,"New Delhi, July 28 (IANS) Homegrown quick-grocery delivery provider Dunzo has promised employees to pay an interest of 12 per cent per annum on the salary component that it held back from June. In addition, the startup assured them that it was on track to pay off all outstanding debts by September 4, according to MoneyControl.

Dunzo announced to pay interest after informing employees earlier this month that it would defer wages for around 500 of them and cap salaries at Rs 75,000 from June, regardless of an employee's pay package.

The company was supposed to clear all pending dues by July 20, but an email was sent out pushing the deadline to September 4.

""Thank you for your patience and continued support. We understand the inconvenience this (delay in salaries) has caused and want to ensure that we provide the possible support for the delay,"" Dunzo's payroll team said in an email to employees, which was seen by Moneycontrol.

""There will be interest paid of 12 per cent per annum,"" it added.

When the final payout is made, all employees who have been affected since June will receive interest for two months, from July 4 to September 4.

An interest rate of 12 per cent per annum translates to an interest rate of 1 per cent per month, according to the report.

For example, a worker who was earning Rs 1 lakh monthly but was only paid Rs 75,000 in June due to Dunzo's decision will now receive 12 per cent annual interest on the remaining Rs 25,000.

Meanwhile, Dunzo has received legal notice from at least seven companies since March this year.

The company had received legal notices from Google (NASDAQ: ) India, Nilenso, Clover Ventures, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) India Online Services Private Limited, Cupshup, Koo and Glance.

Overall, Dunzo's outstanding vendor debts total approximately Rs 11.4 crore, nearly double of Rs 5-6 crore previously estimated.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.

Meta

Meta (NASDAQ: ) popped 4.4% Thursday after the company said it $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32 billion, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.

The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.

Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.

Morgan Stanley was ebullient on the results, hiking Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share and writing:

META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.

Bernstein raved:

They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.

UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.

Shares closed at $311.71.

Alphabet

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped after the search giant surpassed second-quarter analyst expectations, saying Tuesday after the close that it $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6B, driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.

Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.

Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search & other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.

After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, saying: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""

Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:

While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.

Shares jumped 5.8% on Wednesday.

Microsoft

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground Wednesday after reporting the company's CFO warned on the earnings call that CapEx is expected to increase over the next several quarters as the tech giant races to meet strong AI demand.

“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood noted on the earnings call.

For the Q2, Microsoft EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.

“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.

Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to driving meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""

Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on the timing of when these stepped-up investments will pay off:

Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.

Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and lost another 2% to $330.72 in the next session.

Boeing

Boeing (NYSE: ) numbers topped second-quarter estimates as the U.S. plane maker also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.

The company a loss of $0.82 per share on Wednesday, but that was $0.08 narrower than expected, and revenue of $19.75B - up 18% year over year - comfortably exceeded the $18.49B consensus, per analysts polled by Investing.com. Sales were driven by higher deliveries of its 787 model, and Boeing's commercial airplanes segment registered a 41% revenue surge to $8.84B.

Boeing also raised its production plans for the 737 MAX up to 38 per month from 31 by the end of the year, in a sign that the planes are in heavy demand as airlines race to address a post-pandemic surge in travel.

BofA upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral on these results and raised its price target by $75 to $300, arguing that the ""worst is behind"" for the company ""in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels.""

The analyst added:

We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analyst said in a note.

Boeing soared 8.7% to $232.80 Wednesday and was recently adding more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.

McDonald's

McDonald’s (NYSE: ) shares rose 1.2% to $295.19 Thursday after the fast food behemoth beat on the top and bottom line in the second quarter on strong same-store sales.

surged 97% to $3.15, said the company, trouncing the $2.78 average analyst estimate. Revenues rose 14% in constant currencies to $6.5B, edging out the $6.29B consensus.

The company reported that global comparable sales rose 11.7% for the quarter, far better than Wall Street's call for an 8.88% increase. U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3%.

U.S. sales were boosted by strategic menu price increases and positive guest counts, the company said.

""Our second quarter results reflect consistently strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski was quoted as saying in the accompanying press release. ""While global macroeconomic challenges persist, we continue to invest in our growth drivers and our brand.""

According to Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Informatics, the domain had previously been used by sites that did not adhere to the country's strict laws against ""negative"" content such as pornography and gambling, reports Al Jazeera.

Director General of Information and Public Communication at the ministry, Usman Kansong, stated that the government has been in touch with X to gain clarity on the nature of the website.

""Earlier today, we spoke with representatives from Twitter and they will send a letter to us to say that X.com will be used by Twitter,"" Kansong was quoted as saying.

Due to the recent move, Indonesians are currently unable to access the platform, which is said to have approximately 24 million users in a population of 270 million people, the report said.

In 2022, Indonesian authorities threatened to block websites such as Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) if they did not remove ""content deemed unlawful, or that disturbs public order"". Netflix and TikTok were previously banned in the country, in 2016 and 2018, for ""inappropriate content"".

2022-07-27, Investing.com,"Fed raises rates, Meta beats expectations, Intel on tap - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/fed-raises-rates-meta-beats-expectations-intel-on-tap--whats-moving-markets-3741729,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge higher as traders weighed comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell following the central bank's decision to resume its long-standing tightening cycle. Elsewhere, Meta Platforms delivers a second-quarter earnings beat and sounds a positive note on its massive bet on artificial intelligence, while chipmaker Intel is due to report its latest results after the bell.

1. Futures point higher after Fed decision

U.S. stock futures climbed Thursday as investors digested a widely-expected hike by the Federal Reserve that brought borrowing costs up to their highest level in more than two decades.

By 05:24 ET (09:24 GMT), the contract added 65 points or 0.18%, added 25 points or 0.55%, and jumped by 180 points or 1.15%.

The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously voted Wednesday to lift the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, reigniting an unprecedented tightening campaign. In March 2022, the figure stood at near zero.

Commentary after the decision from Fed Chair Jerome Powell was also in the spotlight. Powell said the central bank would determine future policy on a ""meeting by meeting"" basis, but demurred from stating if rates will be raised again at the Fed's next gathering in September.

Adding to the overall market picture were results from social media behemoth Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). The Facebook owner posted double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, while Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg noted that the company's big bet on artificial intelligence (AI) is ""paying off.""

2. Powell looks to give Fed flexibility

If Jerome Powell's careful language on Wednesday is any indication, Fed policymakers seem to be keen to give themselves at least the option to explore future interest rate increases.

But, then again, Powell hinted that another hike may not be necessary.

“I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted,"" Powell said. “And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.”

Much will likely depend on upcoming economic numbers, Powell suggested, flagging that the full impact of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy has ""yet to be felt.""

He added that while the tightening cycle has achieved ""disinflation"" without greatly damaging the labor market, there remains a chance that stronger economic activity could put new fuel into price growth. In any event, Powell said the Fed will remain ""data-dependent.""

3. Meta earnings beat estimates

Meta Platforms reported better-than-anticipated revenue and earnings in the second quarter as resilient customer spending and hype around AI continue to underpin the Instagram and WhatsApp owner's rebound from a dismal 2022.

expanded by 11% to $32 billion in the three months ended June 30, topping estimates of $31.12B. In particular, ad revenue, a major driver of top-line performance at Meta, rose by 12% -- faster than rival Google (NASDAQ: ). Adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 also beat expectations despite a 10% jump in costs.

Coupled with results from Google and software group Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) earlier this week, Meta's returns suggest that advertisers are becoming more willing to spend on digital ads as hopes grow for a soft landing for the U.S. economy after a string of rate hikes aimed at corralling inflation.

Meanwhile, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is starting to see the benefits from investments aimed at folding AI technology into its services. Meta is expecting to spend heavily on building out its infrastructure to support AI in the coming years to keep pace in a burgeoning arms race in Big Tech over the nascent technology.

Shares in Meta surged in premarket trading Thursday.

4. Intel on tap amid earnings parade

The frenzy around AI may remain a key topic when Intel reports its latest earnings on Thursday, with pressure rising on the U.S. chipmaking giant to change its strategy to compete with the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ).

In May, Intel (NASDAQ: ) unveiled new details surrounding a chip designed specifically for AI computing, which the Santa Clara, California-based group is planning to introduce in 2025. The move comes as Intel has seen performance slump in recent quarters as a pandemic-driven bump in personal computing demand eases.

Elsewhere on Thursday, the second-quarter earnings season marches on. Payments processor Mastercard (NYSE: ), burger chain McDonald's (NYSE: ), and telecommunications conglomerate Comcast (NASDAQ: ) make up some of the largest U.S. firms to report.

5. Oil prices higher on tighter supply expectations

Oil prices rose Thursday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, as traders focused on expectations of tighter supplies from major oil producers even after the Federal Reserve resumed its rate-hiking campaign.

Saudi Arabia and Russia both recently announced plans to cut production further in August, in an attempt to boost prices by tightening global supply.

2022-07-26, IANS,Apple considering release of foldable iPad in future: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-considering-release-of-foldable-ipad-in-future-report-3740472,"San Francisco, July 26 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly considering the release of a foldable iPad in the near future, according to insights from supply chain sources.According to the preview of an upcoming report from DigiTimes, Apple is interested in expanding its foldable technology efforts beyond smartphones and into the tablet market.

""Apple, who is rumoured to have been working on foldable smartphones for several years, reportedly is considering extending the effort to the tablet sector,"" as per the preview.

The latest claim adds fuel to prior rumours about the creation of a foldable iPad.

Notably, top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had earlier projected that the device might be released in 2024. Other industry experts, like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, had not yet received any information regarding such a product at the time, reports MacRumors.

According to Kuo, the foldable iPad would have an all-new design as well as a lightweight and sturdy carbon fibre kickstand.

A foldable iPad, like foldable smartphones from Samsung (KS: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), would have a hinge that allows the device to be opened and closed like a book, resulting in a significantly larger display than existing models when unfurled.

A foldable iPad would almost certainly be priced higher than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $1,099, according to the report.

Apple has yet to introduce any devices with foldable displays, but speculations claim that the company is investigating all options, including a foldable iPhone, iPad, and Mac, in the long run.

Meanwhile, the new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models, the first in the Apple iPad series to use OLED displays, will go into mass production in the first quarter of 2024, according to research firm Omdia.

When compared to existing models with LCD screens, the advantages of OLED technology for iPad Pro displays include enhanced brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater colour accuracy, and lower power consumption.

This is up sharply from the 39 times and 45 times, respectively, the term was mentioned in the companies' fourth quarter calls. As such, comments on CapEx and AI spending lead the firm to believe that their above-consensus NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) estimates may ""prove conservative.""

Microsoft expects sequential CapEx increases over the next 12 months to support cloud growth and AI platform demand, analysts noted. Jun-23Q capital expenditures were $8.9bn, up 24% YoY, exceeding street expectations of $8.3 billion. Microsoft anticipates further acceleration in Sep-23Q due to datacenter capacity and hardware investments, including CPUs, GPUs, and networking equipment. This reacceleration, coupled with continuous CapEx growth throughout the year, could result in ~$40B capex spending in its Jun-24 Fiscal Year, representing a ~25% increase.

Meanwhile, Google plans elevated investment in technical infrastructure through 2H23 and continued growth in 2024, primarily driven by AI opportunities. Jun-23Q CapEx of $6.8B was lower than street expectations of $7.9B, mainly due to reduced office facility spending and delayed data center construction projects. However, Google highlighted significant investments in servers for AI compute, and anticipates higher spending in 2H23 after a slower start.

The analysts reiterated its Buy rating and $500 price target on NVIDIA, with the stock labeled a “Franchise Pick”."

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued Meta over its use of Onavo back in December 2020.

The federal court has ordered the two subsidiaries of Meta, Facebook Israel and Onavo Inc, to each pay AUS$10 million for engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.

The subsidiaries, which were the Onavo Protect VPN app's developers and suppliers, were found to be responsible for misleading app descriptions displayed in Google (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) App Store listings.

""In Google and Apple App Store listings, Onavo Protect was promoted as a product that would keep users' data protected and safe, for example with language such as 'Use a free, fast and secure VPN to protect personal information' and 'Helps Keep You and Your Data Safe',"" the commission said.

""In fact, Onavo and Facebook Israel shared the personal activity data from users collected by the app in anonymised and aggregated form with parent company Meta (then known as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: )) for commercial benefit,"" it added.

The watchdog also discovered that between February 2016 and October 2017, Australian users installed the ""Onavo Protect"" VPN app over 270,000 times.

Facebook discontinued the service in May 2019.

""We took this case knowing that many consumers are concerned about how their data is captured, stored and used by digital platforms. We believe Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information that is not misleading,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said in a statement.

As stated in joint submissions to the Court, Onavo and Facebook Israel agreed that the App Store listings conveyed that the Onavo Protect VPN would only use users' data.

In the listings, Onavo Protect did not mention that it collected data about its Australian users' online activities for other purposes, including as a 'business intelligence tool'.

""In the case of the Onavo Protect app, we were concerned that consumers seeking to protect their privacy through a virtual private network were not clearly told that in downloading and using this app they were actually facilitating the use of their data for Meta's commercial benefit,"" Cass-Gottlieb said.

In addition, the startup assured them that it was on track to pay off all outstanding debts by September 4, according to MoneyControl.

Dunzo announced to pay interest after informing employees earlier this month that it would defer wages for around 500 of them and cap salaries at Rs 75,000 from June, regardless of an employee's pay package.

The company was supposed to clear all pending dues by July 20, but an email was sent out pushing the deadline to September 4.

""Thank you for your patience and continued support. We understand the inconvenience this (delay in salaries) has caused and want to ensure that we provide the possible support for the delay,"" Dunzo's payroll team said in an email to employees, which was seen by Moneycontrol.

""There will be interest paid of 12 per cent per annum,"" it added.

When the final payout is made, all employees who have been affected since June will receive interest for two months, from July 4 to September 4.

An interest rate of 12 per cent per annum translates to an interest rate of 1 per cent per month, according to the report.

For example, a worker who was earning Rs 1 lakh monthly but was only paid Rs 75,000 in June due to Dunzo's decision will now receive 12 per cent annual interest on the remaining Rs 25,000.

Meanwhile, Dunzo has received legal notice from at least seven companies since March this year.

The company had received legal notices from Google (NASDAQ: ) India, Nilenso, Clover Ventures, Facebook (NASDAQ: ) India Online Services Private Limited, Cupshup, Koo and Glance.

Overall, Dunzo's outstanding vendor debts total approximately Rs 11.4 crore, nearly double of Rs 5-6 crore previously estimated.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.

Meta

Meta (NASDAQ: ) popped 4.4% Thursday after the company said it $2.98 per share in the second quarter - $0.07 better than the Street had anticipated - on above-par revenue of $32 billion, driven by a 12% year-over-year jump in advertising revenue.

The Facebook operator also projected Q3 revenue of $32B to $34.5B, exceeding the $31.2B consensus.

Daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook rose 5% to 2.06B, while monthly active people (MAUs) climbed 3% to 3.03B.

Morgan Stanley was ebullient on the results, hiking Meta's price target by $25 to $375 per share and writing:

META's AI investments continue to drive higher engagement, advertiser return, platform monetization and EPS. And the product pipeline is flush with a September AI event catalyst.

Bernstein raved:

They've simply done everything right: revenue and [free cash flow] growth keep surpassing even the most ambitious expectations, and they continue to build for the future... which is what we always wanted our Internet companies to do.

UBS raised its price target by $65 to $400, citing September's Meta Connect virtual reality conference as a ""likely positive catalyst"" and citing new generative artificial intelligence (AI) announcements pointing to ""the next leg to the bull case."" BofA similarly believes the company's ""growing AI capabilities"" could drive its multiple higher.

Shares closed at $311.71.

Alphabet

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped after the search giant surpassed second-quarter analyst expectations, saying Tuesday after the close that it $1.44 per share on a top line of $74.6B, driven by advertising growth and robust performance in its cloud business.

Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.34 on revenue of $72.82B.

Google Advertising climbed 3.2%, to $44.68B, with Google Search & other rising 4.8% to $40.69B; Google Cloud was up 28%, to $8.03B, ahead of analyst estimates of $7.87B.

After the results, research firm Bernstein highlighted the Search beat and ""solid progress"" on the AI front, saying: ""A clean quarter. Balanced risk/reward from here for a company steadily improving top-line while all-in on an expensive AI endeavor.""

Goldman Sachs hiked the price target by $12 to $152 per share on Buy-rated GOOGL stock, writing:

While some questions remain around AI’s impact on core products or cost structure, we continue to see Alphabet as a leader that is well positioned to capitalize on a consumer/enterprise computing shift across multiple platforms/products.

Shares jumped 5.8% on Wednesday.

Microsoft

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) beat on earnings for the second quarter, but shares lost ground Wednesday after reporting the company's CFO warned on the earnings call that CapEx is expected to increase over the next several quarters as the tech giant races to meet strong AI demand.

“For FY '24, the impact will be weighted toward H2. To support our Microsoft Cloud growth and demand for our AI platform, we will accelerate investment in our cloud infrastructure,” CFO Amy Hood noted on the earnings call.

For the Q2, Microsoft EPS of $2.69, better than the $2.55 consensus, on revenue of $56.2B vs. expectations of $55.44B.

“Organizations are asking not only how – but how fast – they can apply this next generation of AI to address the biggest opportunities and challenges they face – safely and responsibly,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer of Microsoft.

Bank of America says the expensive AI investment cycle is ""justified given opportunity,"" adding that it views the results ""as validation that Microsoft is ahead of the curve in AI. AI-enabled offerings across Azure and Office are likely to driving meaningful uplift to revenue and operating income at scale.""

Goldman Sachs believes the near-term debate will center on the timing of when these stepped-up investments will pay off:

Microsoft has a strong track record of proving that its capex acceleration is owed to increased business confidence. ...Furthermore, Microsoft is poised to deliver double-digit revenue and earnings growth despite a step-up in CapEx and ~200bps of GM decline in FY24.

Shares closed down 3.7% on Wednesday and lost another 2% to $330.72 in the next session.

Boeing

Boeing (NYSE: ) numbers topped second-quarter estimates as the U.S. plane maker also outlined plans to increase production of its popular 737 MAX narrowbody jet.

The company a loss of $0.82 per share on Wednesday, but that was $0.08 narrower than expected, and revenue of $19.75B - up 18% year over year - comfortably exceeded the $18.49B consensus, per analysts polled by Investing.com. Sales were driven by higher deliveries of its 787 model, and Boeing's commercial airplanes segment registered a 41% revenue surge to $8.84B.

Boeing also raised its production plans for the 737 MAX up to 38 per month from 31 by the end of the year, in a sign that the planes are in heavy demand as airlines race to address a post-pandemic surge in travel.

BofA upgraded Boeing to Buy from Neutral on these results and raised its price target by $75 to $300, arguing that the ""worst is behind"" for the company ""in the midst of the post-COVID commercial recovery with passenger demand emerging back to pre-pandemic levels.""

The analyst added:

We believe that demand is strong enough for Boeing to grow further, even if it were to only maintain its ~40% share of the narrowbody market. Additionally, we believe the 787 will remain the widebody of choice, holding onto the lion’s share of the widebody market vs. its competitors. We also expect there to be ample demand for 10 787s/month through the outyears,” the analyst said in a note.

Boeing soared 8.7% to $232.80 Wednesday and was recently adding more than 1% in premarket trading Thursday.

McDonald's

McDonald’s (NYSE: ) shares rose 1.2% to $295.19 Thursday after the fast food behemoth beat on the top and bottom line in the second quarter on strong same-store sales.

surged 97% to $3.15, said the company, trouncing the $2.78 average analyst estimate. Revenues rose 14% in constant currencies to $6.5B, edging out the $6.29B consensus.

The company reported that global comparable sales rose 11.7% for the quarter, far better than Wall Street's call for an 8.88% increase. U.S. comparable sales rose 10.3%.

U.S. sales were boosted by strategic menu price increases and positive guest counts, the company said.

""Our second quarter results reflect consistently strong execution of our Accelerating the Arches strategy,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski was quoted as saying in the accompanying press release. ""While global macroeconomic challenges persist, we continue to invest in our growth drivers and our brand.""

According to Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Informatics, the domain had previously been used by sites that did not adhere to the country's strict laws against ""negative"" content such as pornography and gambling, reports Al Jazeera.

Director General of Information and Public Communication at the ministry, Usman Kansong, stated that the government has been in touch with X to gain clarity on the nature of the website.

""Earlier today, we spoke with representatives from Twitter and they will send a letter to us to say that X.com will be used by Twitter,"" Kansong was quoted as saying.

Due to the recent move, Indonesians are currently unable to access the platform, which is said to have approximately 24 million users in a population of 270 million people, the report said.

In 2022, Indonesian authorities threatened to block websites such as Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) if they did not remove ""content deemed unlawful, or that disturbs public order"". Netflix and TikTok were previously banned in the country, in 2016 and 2018, for ""inappropriate content"".

2022-07-27, Investing.com,"Fed raises rates, Meta beats expectations, Intel on tap - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/fed-raises-rates-meta-beats-expectations-intel-on-tap--whats-moving-markets-3741729,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge higher as traders weighed comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell following the central bank's decision to resume its long-standing tightening cycle. Elsewhere, Meta Platforms delivers a second-quarter earnings beat and sounds a positive note on its massive bet on artificial intelligence, while chipmaker Intel is due to report its latest results after the bell.

1. Futures point higher after Fed decision

U.S. stock futures climbed Thursday as investors digested a widely-expected hike by the Federal Reserve that brought borrowing costs up to their highest level in more than two decades.

By 05:24 ET (09:24 GMT), the contract added 65 points or 0.18%, added 25 points or 0.55%, and jumped by 180 points or 1.15%.

The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously voted Wednesday to lift the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, reigniting an unprecedented tightening campaign. In March 2022, the figure stood at near zero.

Commentary after the decision from Fed Chair Jerome Powell was also in the spotlight. Powell said the central bank would determine future policy on a ""meeting by meeting"" basis, but demurred from stating if rates will be raised again at the Fed's next gathering in September.

Adding to the overall market picture were results from social media behemoth Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). The Facebook owner posted double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, while Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg noted that the company's big bet on artificial intelligence (AI) is ""paying off.""

2. Powell looks to give Fed flexibility

If Jerome Powell's careful language on Wednesday is any indication, Fed policymakers seem to be keen to give themselves at least the option to explore future interest rate increases.

But, then again, Powell hinted that another hike may not be necessary.

“I would say it’s certainly possible that we will raise funds again at the September meeting if the data warranted,"" Powell said. “And I would also say it’s possible that we would choose to hold steady and we’re going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting.”

Much will likely depend on upcoming economic numbers, Powell suggested, flagging that the full impact of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy has ""yet to be felt.""

He added that while the tightening cycle has achieved ""disinflation"" without greatly damaging the labor market, there remains a chance that stronger economic activity could put new fuel into price growth. In any event, Powell said the Fed will remain ""data-dependent.""

3. Meta earnings beat estimates

Meta Platforms reported better-than-anticipated revenue and earnings in the second quarter as resilient customer spending and hype around AI continue to underpin the Instagram and WhatsApp owner's rebound from a dismal 2022.

expanded by 11% to $32 billion in the three months ended June 30, topping estimates of $31.12B. In particular, ad revenue, a major driver of top-line performance at Meta, rose by 12% -- faster than rival Google (NASDAQ: ). Adjusted earnings per share of $2.98 also beat expectations despite a 10% jump in costs.

Coupled with results from Google and software group Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) earlier this week, Meta's returns suggest that advertisers are becoming more willing to spend on digital ads as hopes grow for a soft landing for the U.S. economy after a string of rate hikes aimed at corralling inflation.

Meanwhile, Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said the company is starting to see the benefits from investments aimed at folding AI technology into its services. Meta is expecting to spend heavily on building out its infrastructure to support AI in the coming years to keep pace in a burgeoning arms race in Big Tech over the nascent technology.

Shares in Meta surged in premarket trading Thursday.

4. Intel on tap amid earnings parade

The frenzy around AI may remain a key topic when Intel reports its latest earnings on Thursday, with pressure rising on the U.S. chipmaking giant to change its strategy to compete with the likes of Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ).

In May, Intel (NASDAQ: ) unveiled new details surrounding a chip designed specifically for AI computing, which the Santa Clara, California-based group is planning to introduce in 2025. The move comes as Intel has seen performance slump in recent quarters as a pandemic-driven bump in personal computing demand eases.

Elsewhere on Thursday, the second-quarter earnings season marches on. Payments processor Mastercard (NYSE: ), burger chain McDonald's (NYSE: ), and telecommunications conglomerate Comcast (NASDAQ: ) make up some of the largest U.S. firms to report.

5. Oil prices higher on tighter supply expectations

Oil prices rose Thursday, rebounding from the previous session’s losses, as traders focused on expectations of tighter supplies from major oil producers even after the Federal Reserve resumed its rate-hiking campaign.

Saudi Arabia and Russia both recently announced plans to cut production further in August, in an attempt to boost prices by tightening global supply.

Oil prices fell on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude inventories fell less than expected and the Fed raised borrowing costs again.

By 05:25 ET, futures traded 1.12% higher at $79.66 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.74% to $83.30."

2022-07-26, IANS,Apple considering release of foldable iPad in future: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/apple-considering-release-of-foldable-ipad-in-future-report-3740472,"San Francisco, July 26 (IANS) Apple (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly considering the release of a foldable iPad in the near future, according to insights from supply chain sources.According to the preview of an upcoming report from DigiTimes, Apple is interested in expanding its foldable technology efforts beyond smartphones and into the tablet market.

""Apple, who is rumoured to have been working on foldable smartphones for several years, reportedly is considering extending the effort to the tablet sector,"" as per the preview.

The latest claim adds fuel to prior rumours about the creation of a foldable iPad.

Notably, top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had earlier projected that the device might be released in 2024. Other industry experts, like Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young, had not yet received any information regarding such a product at the time, reports MacRumors.

According to Kuo, the foldable iPad would have an all-new design as well as a lightweight and sturdy carbon fibre kickstand.

A foldable iPad, like foldable smartphones from Samsung (KS: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ), would have a hinge that allows the device to be opened and closed like a book, resulting in a significantly larger display than existing models when unfurled.

A foldable iPad would almost certainly be priced higher than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, which starts at $1,099, according to the report.

Apple has yet to introduce any devices with foldable displays, but speculations claim that the company is investigating all options, including a foldable iPhone, iPad, and Mac, in the long run.

When compared to existing models with LCD screens, the advantages of OLED technology for iPad Pro displays include enhanced brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater colour accuracy, and lower power consumption.

""In fact, Onavo and Facebook Israel shared the personal activity data from users collected by the app in anonymised and aggregated form with parent company Meta (then known as Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: )) for commercial benefit,"" it added.

The watchdog also discovered that between February 2016 and October 2017, Australian users installed the ""Onavo Protect"" VPN app over 270,000 times.

Facebook discontinued the service in May 2019.

""We took this case knowing that many consumers are concerned about how their data is captured, stored and used by digital platforms. We believe Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information that is not misleading,"" ACCC Chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said in a statement.

As stated in joint submissions to the Court, Onavo and Facebook Israel agreed that the App Store listings conveyed that the Onavo Protect VPN would only use users' data.

In the listings, Onavo Protect did not mention that it collected data about its Australian users' online activities for other purposes, including as a 'business intelligence tool'.

""In the case of the Onavo Protect app, we were concerned that consumers seeking to protect their privacy through a virtual private network were not clearly told that in downloading and using this app they were actually facilitating the use of their data for Meta's commercial benefit,"" Cass-Gottlieb said.

Pinning sets a 1:1 or group chat to the top of Messages.

""You get an icon at the right, while pins are synced with Messages for web,"" the report said.

A 'Pin up to 5 conversations' bubble will appear when users long-press a chat. Earlier this month, it was reported that the tech giant was testing an 'animated emoji' feature for the instant messaging application. It seems like animations will only work when sending one emoji.

So sending more than one emoji or even a combination of text and emoji will not trigger the animation.

This feature was first spotted by Reddit user BruthaBeige.

Also, Android expert Mishaal Rahman had received a tip on the feature, with a user in the replies later revealing its existence. In March this year, the tech giant was reportedly working on a redesigned voice recorder user interface (UI) for Google Messages.

Meanwhile, in January, it was reported that the company would bring a new feature to Google Messages which would allow users to create their own user profile.

2022-07-26, Investing.com,"Dow futures slip after mixed Microsoft, Alphabet results; Fed decision eyed",https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-slip-after-mixed-microsoft-alphabet-results-fed-decision-eyed-3739682,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edged lower Wednesday, as investors digested earnings from some tech titans and awaited news from the latest Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was down 80 points, or 0.2%, traded 8 points, or 0.2% lower, and dropped 45 points, or 0.3%.

The benchmark Wall Street indices closed higher Tuesday, with the blue-chip recording twelve straight winning sessions, gaining nearly 30 points, or 0.1%, amid generally positive earnings and optimism that the Federal Reserve can generate a soft landing for the U.S. economy despite aggressive monetary tightening to combat inflation.

The broad-based also gained 0.3%, after trading at its highest level in more than a year, while the tech-heavy closed 0.6% higher.

Mixed reception for Microsoft, Alphabet earnings

However, this positive streak is under threat Wednesday after mixed results from the dominant tech sector after the close Tuesday.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) stock gained more than 6% premarket after the Google-parent's second-quarter profit impressed with steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising.

On the other hand, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) stock fell almost 4% after growth at its key Azure cloud computing division decelerated to 27% during the April to June period as clients moved to rein in expenditures in the face of economic uncertainty.

Additionally, Snap (NYSE: ) stock slumped almost 20% after the photo messaging app owner offered up weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance as it struggles to compete for advertising dollars.

Meta Platforms next up for tech sector

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) will be the next tech behemoth to post second-quarter after the close Wednesday, with investors keen to hear more from the Facebook owner's new Twitter competitor, called Threads, which gathered 100 million users in its first week.

Other major companies scheduled to release results Wednesday include soft drinks giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: ), telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE: ), fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE: ), and toy maker Mattel (NASDAQ: ).

Chair Powell in focus as Fed concludes meeting

The concludes its latest policy meeting later this session, and is widely expected to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point, as it attempts to tame still-elevated inflation.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is a more than 98% probability that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will lift the benchmark Fed Funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

Given the perceived near certainty of a hike, the spotlight is likely to be more on what Chair says during his press conference about the direction of future rate policy.

Crude retreats from three-month highs

Oil prices retreated from three-month highs after industry data showed a rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, suggesting that supplies were not as tight as previously thought in the important American market.

Data from the , released Tuesday, suggested U.S. crude stocks rose by 1.3 million barrels in the past week. Official numbers from the will be studied later Wednesday for confirmation.

By 06:30 ET, futures traded 1% lower at $78.83 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1% to $82.42.

Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since April on Tuesday amid concerns over tighter supplies and pledges by Chinese authorities to shore up the world's second-biggest economy and largest crude importer.

Additionally, rose 0.4% to $1,971.25/oz, while traded 0.2% higher at 1.1075.

The company introduced four updates to help users find high-quality large screen apps on its app store -- refreshed app listing pages, ranking and quality improvements, streamlined store navigation, and a split-screen search experience.

""Your store listing page is the best way to demonstrate the functionality and value of your app, so we’ve revamped the experience to put your content front and centre,"" the tech giant added.

Games with high-quality videos will now show a video banner at the top of their app listing page, allowing users to get a sense of gameplay in an “immersive” way.

The company also reorganised apps and games details pages in a multi-column layout, bringing more of users' content higher up on the page.

To promote high-quality apps that ""shine"" on large screens, the tech giant made several ranking changes to boost quality across the Play Store.

""Apps and games that adhere to our large screen app quality guidelines will now be ranked higher in search and Apps and Games Home,"" the company said.

“For more seamless browsing, we’ve simplified our store navigation and moved to a left-side navigation rail on larger screens.”

This puts menu items closer to users’ thumbs and makes them more accessible, especially when holding a device in landscape mode.

With the new split-screen search experience, users can easily discover and compare apps from within the search results page.

“These changes will begin rolling out over the coming weeks, and are just the beginning of our journey in creating a tailored Play Store experience for large screens,” Google added.

Pinning sets a 1:1 or group chat to the top of Messages.

""You get an icon at the right, while pins are synced with Messages for web,"" the report said.

A 'Pin up to 5 conversations' bubble will appear when users long-press a chat. Earlier this month, it was reported that the tech giant was testing an 'animated emoji' feature for the instant messaging application. It seems like animations will only work when sending one emoji.

So sending more than one emoji or even a combination of text and emoji will not trigger the animation.

This feature was first spotted by Reddit user BruthaBeige.

Also, Android expert Mishaal Rahman had received a tip on the feature, with a user in the replies later revealing its existence. In March this year, the tech giant was reportedly working on a redesigned voice recorder user interface (UI) for Google Messages.

Meanwhile, in January, it was reported that the company would bring a new feature to Google Messages which would allow users to create their own user profile.

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was down 80 points, or 0.2%, traded 8 points, or 0.2% lower, and dropped 45 points, or 0.3%.

The benchmark Wall Street indices closed higher Tuesday, with the blue-chip recording twelve straight winning sessions, gaining nearly 30 points, or 0.1%, amid generally positive earnings and optimism that the Federal Reserve can generate a soft landing for the U.S. economy despite aggressive monetary tightening to combat inflation.

The broad-based also gained 0.3%, after trading at its highest level in more than a year, while the tech-heavy closed 0.6% higher.

Mixed reception for Microsoft, Alphabet earnings

However, this positive streak is under threat Wednesday after mixed results from the dominant tech sector after the close Tuesday.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) stock gained more than 6% premarket after the Google-parent's second-quarter profit impressed with steady demand for its cloud services and a rebound in advertising.

On the other hand, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) stock fell almost 4% after growth at its key Azure cloud computing division decelerated to 27% during the April to June period as clients moved to rein in expenditures in the face of economic uncertainty.

Additionally, Snap (NYSE: ) stock slumped almost 20% after the photo messaging app owner offered up weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance as it struggles to compete for advertising dollars.

Meta Platforms next up for tech sector

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) will be the next tech behemoth to post second-quarter after the close Wednesday, with investors keen to hear more from the Facebook owner's new Twitter competitor, called Threads, which gathered 100 million users in its first week.

Other major companies scheduled to release results Wednesday include soft drinks giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: ), aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: ), telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE: ), fast food chain Chipotle (NYSE: ), and toy maker Mattel (NASDAQ: ).

Chair Powell in focus as Fed concludes meeting

The concludes its latest policy meeting later this session, and is widely expected to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point, as it attempts to tame still-elevated inflation.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is a more than 98% probability that the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee will lift the benchmark Fed Funds rate to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%.

Given the perceived near certainty of a hike, the spotlight is likely to be more on what Chair says during his press conference about the direction of future rate policy.

Crude retreats from three-month highs

Oil prices retreated from three-month highs after industry data showed a rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, suggesting that supplies were not as tight as previously thought in the important American market.

Data from the , released Tuesday, suggested U.S. crude stocks rose by 1.3 million barrels in the past week. Official numbers from the will be studied later Wednesday for confirmation.

The company introduced four updates to help users find high-quality large screen apps on its app store -- refreshed app listing pages, ranking and quality improvements, streamlined store navigation, and a split-screen search experience.

""Your store listing page is the best way to demonstrate the functionality and value of your app, so we’ve revamped the experience to put your content front and centre,"" the tech giant added.

Games with high-quality videos will now show a video banner at the top of their app listing page, allowing users to get a sense of gameplay in an “immersive” way.

The company also reorganised apps and games details pages in a multi-column layout, bringing more of users' content higher up on the page.

To promote high-quality apps that ""shine"" on large screens, the tech giant made several ranking changes to boost quality across the Play Store.

""Apps and games that adhere to our large screen app quality guidelines will now be ranked higher in search and Apps and Games Home,"" the company said.

“For more seamless browsing, we’ve simplified our store navigation and moved to a left-side navigation rail on larger screens.”

This puts menu items closer to users’ thumbs and makes them more accessible, especially when holding a device in landscape mode.

With the new split-screen search experience, users can easily discover and compare apps from within the search results page.

“These changes will begin rolling out over the coming weeks, and are just the beginning of our journey in creating a tailored Play Store experience for large screens,” Google added.

Overall, Dunzo's outstanding vendor debts total approximately Rs 11.4 crore, nearly double the Rs 5-6 crore previously estimated.

Clover Ventures, an agritech startup, recently demanded that Dunzo clear dues that have now totalled over Rs 2 crore, according to the legal notice that Clover Ventures sent to Dunzo, while Cupshup, an advertising company, also sent a legal notice to Dunzo demanding to pay Rs 1 crore that it owes Cupshup for the services provided.

Cupshup said that Dunzo has promised money on multiple occasions in the past but never made payments, according to the report.

""The outstanding amount is substantial and owing to the delay in payments, my client has suffered severe financial hardships. My client is also responsible for the livelihood of its employees and hence cannot keep waiting for the payments,"" Cupshup's legal notice was quoted as saying.

Moreover, lock-screen platform Glance sent a notice demanding Dunzo to pay Rs 58 lakh for the services that the quick-grocery delivery provider availed.

Glance typically runs ads for companies on the lock screens of phones.

The microblogging website Koo had subleased office space from Dunzo earlier this year and vacated the space.

However, Koo has not yet received a refund of its security deposit of over Rs 62 lakh.

""Despite our client vacating and handing over the vacant possession of the demised premises to you on March 31, 2022, you have failed to refund the security deposit back after deducting certain amounts, and thereby breached the terms of the Agreement,"" a legal team representing Koo was quoted as saying.

The slew of legal notices comes after Dunzo faced a legal notice by Facebook India Online Services Private Ltd and Bengaluru-based software consultancy firm Nilenso over unpaid dues of Rs 4 crore.

Google India, Dunzo's second-largest investor after Reliance (NS: ) Retail, sent Dunzo a legal notice requiring the startup to pay over Rs 3.1 crore to the tech giant for various services rendered, the report mentioned.

""Google has made numerous requests to Dunzo Digital for payment of an outstanding principal balance due and owing Google in the amount of (Rs) 2,88,31,760.16. However, said amount remains unpaid,"" a legal notice which the tech giant's legal firm was quoted as saying.

Meanwhile, Dunzo has said it will not be able to pay employees' salaries until early September, a further delay from the earlier deadline of July 20.

The company has also delayed the August salary for senior employees to September 4 as well, it said in an email seen by TechCrunch.

The man's car went over a cliff and dropped 400 feet before crashing to a halt.

""He was 400 feet down in a canyon with virtually no way out,"" said Steve Goldsworthy, the Rescue Operations Leader of Montrose Search and Rescue.

""So, who knows when, or if, we would've located him.""

""The location that we got from the iPhone activation was spot on,"" Goldsworthy added.

Goldsworthy further explained, ""It was basically his phone on its own, calling for help on his behalf.""

""I believe that if we didn't have that good location information in a timely manner, he probably would've bled out,"" said Mike Leum, one of the

members of Montrose Search and Rescue.

In January, it was reported that the Emergency SOS via satellite feature on iPhone had helped to save two women who were stranded in Canadian Province 'British Columbia' (BC).

The women found that a highway was closed because of an accident while they were returning to Alberta, Canada, so they chose to take the Holmes Forest Service Road after using Google (NASDAQ: ) Maps to find an alternate route.

They eventually arrived at the spot where the grader had stopped, but the road was only partially ploughed.

""Then it was basically a wall of snow and when they tried to get through it, they got stuck,"" explained Dwight Yochim, senior manager with BC Search

and Rescue.

""There's no cell service there but one of them happened to have the new Apple phone that has the SOS in it and activated the SOS and to my

knowledge, that's the first use of the SOS in British Columbia,” Yochim added.

Later, the rescue team found them, pulled their vehicle out and got them turned around and back on the way.

2022-07-25, IANS,Mastodon has child abuse material problem: Study,https://in.investing.com/news/mastodon-has-child-abuse-material-problem-study-3737727,"San Francisco, July 25 (IANS) Decentralised social media platform Mastodon, viewed as a viable alternative to Twitter (Now X), is rife with child sexual abuse material (CSAM), a new study has shown.According to the researchers from the US-based Stanford Internet Observatory, the findings raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of safety efforts across so-called 'decentralised' platforms, which allow users to join independently run communities with their own moderation rules, particularly when dealing with the internet's most vile content, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Over two days, researchers found 112 matches for known CSAM in addition to nearly 2,000 posts that used the 20 most common hashtags which indicate the exchange of abuse materials.

The Internet Observatory searched for CSAM on the 25 most popular Mastodon instances. Researchers also used Google (NASDAQ: )'s SafeSearch API and PhotoDNA, a tool that helps find flagged CSAM, to identify explicit images.

“We got more photoDNA hits in a two-day period than we’ve probably had in the entire history of our organisation of doing any kind of social media analysis, and it’s not even close,” David Thiel, one of the study’s authors, was quoted as saying.

During its search, the team discovered 554 pieces of content that matched hashtags or keywords commonly used by online child sexual abuse groups, all

of which were identified as explicit with 'highest confidence' by Google SafeSearch.

There were also 713 mentions of the top 20 CSAM-related hashtags on Fediverse (a group of federated social networking services) posts with

media, and 1,217 text-only mentions of 'off-site CSAM trading or grooming of minors'.

According to the study, the open posting of CSAM is 'disturbingly prevalent'.

Decentralised networks do not approach moderation in the same way that mainstream sites like Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, and Reddit do. Instead,

moderation is delegated to each decentralised instance, which can lead to inconsistency across the Fediverse.

Microsoft, Alphabet set to publish earnings

The tech sector is likely to be in focus Tuesday, with Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet scheduled to post their latest earnings after the close, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve gears up to start a highly-anticipated policy meeting and China's government vows to roll out measures to reignite the country's flagging economic recovery.

1. Microsoft, Alphabet to report

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to post their latest earnings after the close of U.S. trading on Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

For both Microsoft and Alphabet, attention will likely center around their cloud computing businesses. The units have been consistent cash cows for both companies, although performance has suffered in recent quarters as economic uncertainty convinces many customers to rein in spending.

The weakness may have extended into the April to June quarter, according to analysts cited by Reuters. Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, the group's biggest revenue driver and home to its Azure public cloud computing platform, is seen expanding at its slowest rate since 2017 during the period. Alphabet's own cloud computing unit, meanwhile, is expected to slip to its lowest growth ever.

But some analysts say that the pressure on cloud computing may be waning, noting that many clients are beginning to figure out how to operate in a softer macroeconomic environment.

Elsewhere, generative artificial intelligence, which has driven a surge in tech stocks this year, will remain in the spotlight. The focus will be on how Microsoft and Alphabet, as well as rivals Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), plan to generate revenue from their AI offerings.

Meta Platforms is due to report its latest earnings on Wednesday and Amazon on Aug. 3.

2. Futures mixed ahead of earnings, Federal Reserve decision

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Tuesday as investors prepared themselves for a series of fresh corporate earnings and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

By 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract slipped by 3 points or 0.01%, added 7 points or 0.16%, and gained 61 points or 0.39%.

The 30-stock climbed to its eleventh straight winning session on Monday, while the benchmark and tech-heavy also rose.

Aside from Microsoft and Alphabet, Verizon (NYSE: ), General Electric (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) will also unveil results before the bell Tuesday.

Several stronger-than-expected second-quarter returns have helped to fuel hopes that the U.S. economy will engineer a soft landing in the face of surging interest rates. The is widely forecast to increase borrowing costs by another quarter percentage point on Wednesday, while Wall Street will also be keeping a close eye on comments about the broader economic outlook from the central bank's chair Jerome Powell.

3. Fed to kick off two-day meeting

Fed policymakers will begin their closely-watched two-day meeting on Tuesday with markets already largely pricing in a 25-basis point interest rate increase later this week.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is currently a more than 98% chance that the bank will lift interest rates to a new range of 5.25% to 5.50% following the conclusion of its latest gathering on Wednesday.

The near-consensus projections could lend additional importance to remarks from Powell. In particular, observers will be on the lookout for any signals that the Fed could be planning to bring its long-standing policy-tightening campaign to a halt.

Crucially, recent data has pointed to a softening in inflation, which had been the main driver behind the Fed's historic string of rate rises. But with uncertainty still surrounding how price growth will evolve over the coming months, there remains the possibility that the Fed could retain the flexibility to hike rates further if necessary.

4. China promises economic support measures

The decision-making body of China's ruling Communist Party has pledged to step up measures aimed at reinvigorating a post-COVID recovery that it described as ""tortuous.""

Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slowed substantially in the as its biggest drivers -- manufacturing and real estate -- remained under pressure.

In response, Beijing will adjust its policy to help boost domestic demand, support confidence and prevent risks, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the 24-member politburo. These changes would also aim to ""stabilize"" foreign trade, the politburo was quoted as saying following a Monday meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.

Chinese shares rallied on Tuesday following the news, with technology and property stocks posting particularly strong gains.

5. Oil holds firm after China support pledges

Oil prices stabilized near three-month highs, with traders digesting China's plans for more stimulus measures and signs of tight supplies ahead of the Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.

U.S. inventory data are also in focus. Industry numbers from the American Petroleum Institute are due out on Tuesday, followed on Wednesday by the official figures from the Energy Information Administration. Stockpiles are expected to have fallen by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 21, indicating steady demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

The new feature is currently rolling out to all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts.

Moreover, the option does not have admin control, the company said. Last week, the tech giant had announced that it was adding the 'Alt text' option in the 'Image options' sidebar of Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drawings.

Earlier this month, the company had announced that it was revamping the ""first open experience"" in Docs on Android devices.

With the revamped experience, the Docs app starts in the edit mode.

In June, Google had announced that it was making 'paginated mode' default on Docs for Android, which sets up the Google Doc with pages and page breaks in the app, enabling a more cohesive visual design between the web and mobile.

""We are excited to expand access to even more users once our standard testing procedures are complete.""

It seems that there are some limitations to using Bing Chat on Chrome and Safari.

The chatbot's communication with users will also restart after five turns rather than 30.

Microsoft has also introduced a dark option for Bing Chat in addition to a wider rollout across other browsers.

Users can access dark mode by selecting the hamburger menu in the top-right corner of Bing Chat and then choosing Appearance > Dark or System Default.

In January, it was reported that the Emergency SOS via satellite feature on iPhone had helped to save two women who were stranded in Canadian Province 'British Columbia' (BC).

The women found that a highway was closed because of an accident while they were returning to Alberta, Canada, so they chose to take the Holmes Forest Service Road after using Google (NASDAQ: ) Maps to find an alternate route.

They eventually arrived at the spot where the grader had stopped, but the road was only partially ploughed.

""Then it was basically a wall of snow and when they tried to get through it, they got stuck,"" explained Dwight Yochim, senior manager with BC Search

and Rescue.

""There's no cell service there but one of them happened to have the new Apple phone that has the SOS in it and activated the SOS and to my

knowledge, that's the first use of the SOS in British Columbia,” Yochim added.

Later, the rescue team found them, pulled their vehicle out and got them turned around and back on the way.

2022-07-25, IANS,Mastodon has child abuse material problem: Study,https://in.investing.com/news/mastodon-has-child-abuse-material-problem-study-3737727,"San Francisco, July 25 (IANS) Decentralised social media platform Mastodon, viewed as a viable alternative to Twitter (Now X), is rife with child sexual abuse material (CSAM), a new study has shown.According to the researchers from the US-based Stanford Internet Observatory, the findings raise serious concerns about the effectiveness of safety efforts across so-called 'decentralised' platforms, which allow users to join independently run communities with their own moderation rules, particularly when dealing with the internet's most vile content, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Over two days, researchers found 112 matches for known CSAM in addition to nearly 2,000 posts that used the 20 most common hashtags which indicate the exchange of abuse materials.

The Internet Observatory searched for CSAM on the 25 most popular Mastodon instances. Researchers also used Google (NASDAQ: )'s SafeSearch API and PhotoDNA, a tool that helps find flagged CSAM, to identify explicit images.

“We got more photoDNA hits in a two-day period than we’ve probably had in the entire history of our organisation of doing any kind of social media analysis, and it’s not even close,” David Thiel, one of the study’s authors, was quoted as saying.

During its search, the team discovered 554 pieces of content that matched hashtags or keywords commonly used by online child sexual abuse groups, all

of which were identified as explicit with 'highest confidence' by Google SafeSearch.

There were also 713 mentions of the top 20 CSAM-related hashtags on Fediverse (a group of federated social networking services) posts with

media, and 1,217 text-only mentions of 'off-site CSAM trading or grooming of minors'.

According to the study, the open posting of CSAM is 'disturbingly prevalent'.

Decentralised networks do not approach moderation in the same way that mainstream sites like Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Instagram, and Reddit do. Instead,

moderation is delegated to each decentralised instance, which can lead to inconsistency across the Fediverse.

The broad-based also gained 0.4%, and the tech-heavy closed 0.2% higher, as a stronger-than-expected earnings season to date has boosted market confidence.

Microsoft, Alphabet set to publish earnings

The tech sector is likely to be in focus Tuesday, with Microsoft and Google-owner Alphabet scheduled to post their latest earnings after the close, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

For both Microsoft and Alphabet, attention will likely center around their cloud computing businesses. The units have been consistent cash cows for both companies, although performance has suffered in recent quarters as economic uncertainty convinces many customers to rein in spending.

2022-07-25, Investing.com,"Microsoft and Alphabet earnings, Fed decision ahead - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-and-alphabet-earnings-fed-decision-ahead--whats-moving-markets-3737468,"Investing.com -- Microsoft and Alphabet are scheduled to unveil their quarterly earnings, with the results likely to set the tone for upcoming numbers from other tech sector titans. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve gears up to start a highly-anticipated policy meeting and China's government vows to roll out measures to reignite the country's flagging economic recovery.

1. Microsoft, Alphabet to report

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) are set to post their latest earnings after the close of U.S. trading on Tuesday, kicking off two weeks of results from big-name technology firms.

For both Microsoft and Alphabet, attention will likely center around their cloud computing businesses. The units have been consistent cash cows for both companies, although performance has suffered in recent quarters as economic uncertainty convinces many customers to rein in spending.

The weakness may have extended into the April to June quarter, according to analysts cited by Reuters. Microsoft Intelligent Cloud, the group's biggest revenue driver and home to its Azure public cloud computing platform, is seen expanding at its slowest rate since 2017 during the period. Alphabet's own cloud computing unit, meanwhile, is expected to slip to its lowest growth ever.

But some analysts say that the pressure on cloud computing may be waning, noting that many clients are beginning to figure out how to operate in a softer macroeconomic environment.

Elsewhere, generative artificial intelligence, which has driven a surge in tech stocks this year, will remain in the spotlight. The focus will be on how Microsoft and Alphabet, as well as rivals Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), plan to generate revenue from their AI offerings.

Meta Platforms is due to report its latest earnings on Wednesday and Amazon on Aug. 3.

2. Futures mixed ahead of earnings, Federal Reserve decision

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Tuesday as investors prepared themselves for a series of fresh corporate earnings and a key policy decision from the Federal Reserve.

By 05:12 ET (09:12 GMT), the contract slipped by 3 points or 0.01%, added 7 points or 0.16%, and gained 61 points or 0.39%.

The 30-stock climbed to its eleventh straight winning session on Monday, while the benchmark and tech-heavy also rose.

Aside from Microsoft and Alphabet, Verizon (NYSE: ), General Electric (NYSE: ) and General Motors (NYSE: ) will also unveil results before the bell Tuesday.

Several stronger-than-expected second-quarter returns have helped to fuel hopes that the U.S. economy will engineer a soft landing in the face of surging interest rates. The is widely forecast to increase borrowing costs by another quarter percentage point on Wednesday, while Wall Street will also be keeping a close eye on comments about the broader economic outlook from the central bank's chair Jerome Powell.

3. Fed to kick off two-day meeting

Fed policymakers will begin their closely-watched two-day meeting on Tuesday with markets already largely pricing in a 25-basis point interest rate increase later this week.

According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool , there is currently a more than 98% chance that the bank will lift interest rates to a new range of 5.25% to 5.50% following the conclusion of its latest gathering on Wednesday.

The near-consensus projections could lend additional importance to remarks from Powell. In particular, observers will be on the lookout for any signals that the Fed could be planning to bring its long-standing policy-tightening campaign to a halt.

Crucially, recent data has pointed to a softening in inflation, which had been the main driver behind the Fed's historic string of rate rises. But with uncertainty still surrounding how price growth will evolve over the coming months, there remains the possibility that the Fed could retain the flexibility to hike rates further if necessary.

4. China promises economic support measures

The decision-making body of China's ruling Communist Party has pledged to step up measures aimed at reinvigorating a post-COVID recovery that it described as ""tortuous.""

Growth in the world's second-biggest economy slowed substantially in the as its biggest drivers -- manufacturing and real estate -- remained under pressure.

In response, Beijing will adjust its policy to help boost domestic demand, support confidence and prevent risks, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing the 24-member politburo. These changes would also aim to ""stabilize"" foreign trade, the politburo was quoted as saying following a Monday meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.

Chinese shares rallied on Tuesday following the news, with technology and property stocks posting particularly strong gains.

5. Oil holds firm after China support pledges

Oil prices stabilized near three-month highs, with traders digesting China's plans for more stimulus measures and signs of tight supplies ahead of the Federal Reserve policy-setting meeting.

U.S. inventory data are also in focus. Industry numbers from the American Petroleum Institute are due out on Tuesday, followed on Wednesday by the official figures from the Energy Information Administration. Stockpiles are expected to have fallen by over 2 million barrels in the week to July 21, indicating steady demand in the world’s largest oil consumer.

At 09:12 ET, the futures traded 0.27% lower at $78.53 a barrel, while the contract dropped by 0.34% to $82.20 per barrel.

The numbers are automatically calculated next to each line in the document, and can be configurable for the entire document, a page or a specific section. Moreover, these numbers are preserved when printing.

This feature makes it easier for users to reference specific content positions in documents, particularly when collaborating with others on long or complex content.

The new feature is currently rolling out to all Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts.

Moreover, the option does not have admin control, the company said. Last week, the tech giant had announced that it was adding the 'Alt text' option in the 'Image options' sidebar of Docs, Sheets, Slides and Drawings.

Earlier this month, the company had announced that it was revamping the ""first open experience"" in Docs on Android devices.

With the revamped experience, the Docs app starts in the edit mode.

In June, Google had announced that it was making 'paginated mode' default on Docs for Android, which sets up the Google Doc with pages and page breaks in the app, enabling a more cohesive visual design between the web and mobile.

""We are excited to expand access to even more users once our standard testing procedures are complete.""

It seems that there are some limitations to using Bing Chat on Chrome and Safari.

For instance, users can only type 2,000-word prompts, as compared to the 4,000-word limit that the company provides when using Bing Chat on Edge.

The chatbot's communication with users will also restart after five turns rather than 30.

Microsoft has also introduced a dark option for Bing Chat in addition to a wider rollout across other browsers.

Users can access dark mode by selecting the hamburger menu in the top-right corner of Bing Chat and then choosing Appearance > Dark or System Default.

The chatbot was previously only accessible through Edge, which was very inconvenient if users wanted to use the tool on other browsers, the report said.

Last week, the tech giant had announced that it was rolling out multimodal capabilities via Visual Search in Bing Chat.

The Visual Search feature leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model, and allows users to upload images and search the web for related content.

Meanwhile, last month, the company had launched a 'voice chat' feature for Bing Chat on the desktop, which allows users to talk to the AI chatbot by clicking on the microphone icon in the Bing Chat box.

Still, the last week marked the eighth green weekly candle for the S&P 500 in the last 10 weeks as the generative AI frenzy keeps fueling the equities bull run.

Nasdaq ( ) lost 0.6% despite a strong rally in the opening days of the last week, ultimately resulting in a shooting star candle – which is a bearish near-term signal for tech-heavy IXIC. A short-term pullback could push the index to revisit important support around 13200, suggesting a pullback of around 6%.

On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) surged 2.1% to finally break out of the tight trading range. Last week’s high marks the highest the DJI index traded since April 2022.

This week is packed with U.S. economic data, starting with preliminary and results for July. The interest rate decision is out on Wednesday with the market fully expecting another – and possibly final – 25 bps rate hike.

""The key question is how strongly [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell will nod toward the 'careful pace' of tightening he advocated in June, which we and others have taken to imply an every-other-meeting approach,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said last week.

On Thursday, we will see the preliminary numbers for the second quarter, coupled with the for July. Finally, the - Price Index report is out on Friday.

Mega-caps take the stage

The Q2 earnings season is in full swing after several mega-caps, including (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ), reported last week. So far, 18% of the S&P 500 companies reported actual results with 75% of those reported topping EPS estimates, according to FactSet.

“It’s still too early to determine how the Q2 earnings season will turn out. That said, in our view “so far so good” with five sectors showing positive double digit earnings growth (energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services and real estate), three sectors posting positive single digit earnings growth (consumer staples, health care and financials), and two sectors delivering double digit negative earnings growth (materials and information technology),” Oppenheimer strategists said.

For Q2 2022, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 is -9.0%, which is higher than the expected earnings decline of 7%.

“The (blended) net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q2 2022 is 11.1%, which is below the previous quarter’s net profit margin (11.5%), below the year-ago net profit margin (12.2%), and below the 5-year average (11.4%). If 11.1% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the sixth straight quarter in which the net profit margin for the index has declined year-over-year,” FactSet analysts wrote in a blog post on Friday.

Some of the most notable companies to report this week include General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Wedbush analysts argue that Street’s focus is on Microsoft.

“The entire Street will be laser focused on one print this week: Microsoft. While this is a massive week for Big Tech earnings season there is no better barometer of the overall cloud and enterprise spending environment than Redmond and all eyes will be glued to the screens Tuesday after the bell,” they said in a client note.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Morgan Stanley analysts: “2022 has been a story of higher valuations than we expected amid falling inflation and cost-cutting. However, disinflation is now eating into sales growth, which means investor focus is likely to shift toward top line growers rather than just companies exhibiting cost efficiencies.”

Oppenheimer analysts: “We remain highly constructive on equities on expectations that economic fundamentals are likely to remain resilient if not robust in this period of significant transition tied to monetary policy. Corporations, the consumer and labor continue to reflect in our view resilience characteristic with a recovery process from a period of crisis and great uncertainty into a period of sustainable economic growth.”

Barclays analysts: “Valuations are up and earnings are in the hot seat as we enter the busiest weeks of summer reporting season. Estimates are heading lower for most sectors, while uncertainty is high for Big Tech. Two potential sources of downside: negative operating leverage worsened by faster disinflation, and China exposure.”

Berenberg analysts: “US equities look expensive in both absolute and relative terms compared to non-US equities. Equity bond yield gaps (excluding Japan) have compressed or even reversed in the last 12- 18 months. However, the gap between the US equity-bond yield gap and non-US yield gaps is near historical highs – this suggests more relative support for non-US equities versus local bonds than in the US. In absolute terms, US equities trade above a 12-month forward P/E of 20x for only the third time in the last 50 years; the last two times that US equities have been this expensive were both liquidity-fuelled bubbles.”

Goldman Sachs analysts: “We believe recent valuation expansion despite higher rates is reasonable considering the longer-term relationship between rates and equities, the improvement in expected growth, and the high market concentration in stocks benefiting from AI optimism. While our baseline forecast assumes a slight contraction in the S&P 500 P/E multiple to 19x by year-end, we believe risks to valuations are tilted to the upside if the multiples of laggards “catch up” or yields fall.”"

Earnings season kicks into top gear

Helping the generally positive tone has been a largely beneficial earnings season to date, but the quarter kicks into top gear this week with around 40% of the DJIA and 30% of the S&P 500 set to give their financial updates.

This includes tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), although the slate is relatively quiet on Monday, with the focus on the likes of home appliances manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE: ), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: ) and pizza chain Domino’s (NYSE: ).

Additionally, toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ: ) is set to receive a boost from the strong showing of the ""Barbie"" movie, which recorded the biggest domestic debut of 2022.

Fed meeting key in determining sentiment

Also of crucial importance this week, the is widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points on Wednesday, which may be the final rate hike of its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades.

This thesis has helped buoy stocks in recent weeks, and any indication coming out of the meeting that the policymakers have been discussing further hikes could weigh heavily on Wall Street.

The U.S. economic data slate centers around the latest S&P Global activity data for July, with the flash expected to fall to 54.0 from 54.4 in June and the flash seen rising to 46.4 in July from 46.3.

They see “a significant opportunity for GPU supplier NVDA” with the TAM (total addressable market) expanding 10 times over the next 5 years to more than $400 billion.

“We see AI server unit penetration reaching ~11% by C27E, and NVDA, with conservative ~75% share (vs. 90%+ today), potentially driving ~$300B in AI-specific revenue,” they said in a client note.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is expected to have a ~5% of AI server share by 2027. The analysts also highlighted Amazon’s (NASDAQ: ) AWS Inferentia, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) Dojo, or Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google that could capture AI market share gains.

“We see more room to unlock value with solid AI roadmaps accelerating.”

Despite robust YTD gains in Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) stock, Mizuho sees room for this rally to continue.

“Assuming $30-100B AI revenues (or ~$65B at the midpoint), we estimate implied share price to reflect AI estimates for C23-25E would be $490-$769/share, and a midpoint at ~$625 PT,” the analysts concluded.

The $769/share price implies Nvidia’s market cap at ~$1.9 trillion.

Moreover, users will be able to ask for it directly by saying, “Summarise this”.

The Summarise option is expected to appear when users are browsing through Chrome directly or when an app opens a webpage in a Custom Tab.

Last month, the tech giant had introduced two new voices--Lime and Indigo-- for its virtual assistant software application.

Earlier this month, it was reported that the company “deprioritised” its plans to launch an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile chatbot application 'Bubble Characters' specifically designed for Gen Z users, featuring interactive digital characters.

Of the 163,370 individuals who gave up citizenship of India in 2021, a major chunk of 78,284 chose the US as their adoptive country with many saying that the American citizenship was most sought after for “reasons personal to them"".

A record number of Indian students chose the United States to pursue higher education with nearly 21 per cent of the over one million foreign students studying in the US being Indians, according to a recent US High Commission data.

Almost 200,000 Indian students chose America as their higher education destination in the 2021-22 academic year -- a 19 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the Open Doors Report released this year.

Unlike Sundar Pichai, who completed his bachelor’s degree in India before heading abroad to take on Google (NASDAQ: ), most students in India now want to leave for foreign shores immediately after finishing their class 12th. ""The earlier I start, the better it is,"" Snehal Sinha, a 16-year-old commerce student with American dreams, told IANS.

For students and techies in a country with a billion-plus population, the US still means a land of opportunity, offering world-class education, better job prospects, and a chance to build a better life.

The country is home to nearly 4,000 universities known for their high academic standards. An international student has a wide range of choices, regardless of the state in which they choose to study.

India’s domestic education system has grown to be one of the largest in the world, with close to 52,000 institutions. But, despite this expanded access, postgraduate opportunities are still few and far between in the country, which is one of the big reasons students look overseas, notes American International Recruitment Council (AIRC).

As of 2018-19, only 35 per cent of Indian higher education institutions offered postgraduate programs, and 2.5 per cent offered PhD programs, unlike the US with its strong graduate programs and post-study work opportunities.

More than 77 per cent of Indian students in the US studied STEM in the 2020-21 academic year with maths and computer science being the most popular STEM fields, accounting for 35 per cent of Indians in 2020-21.

In 2022, the White House announced additional STEM fields eligible for Optional Practical Training STEM Extension, which provides students with an opportunity to find off-campus employment or an internship within their field of study.

Optional Practical Training allows overseas students with an F-1 visa to work up to 12 months during or after the study duration. Students with STEM degrees get another 12 months and can work up to 24 months.

Another program, the Curricular Practical Training gives international students authorisation to gain employment training and to work in paid internships positions.

The success stories of Indian-origin CEOs Satya Nadella, Shantanu Narayen, and Arvind Krishna have also played a role in attracting Indian students and techies who want to make a mark in Silicon Valley.

An opportunity to “work onsite” and “earn in dollars” has been a big lure for Indian engineers ever since the tech boom swept the country almost two decades ago, says a Quartz report.

It adds that more than anything, a US visa for an Indian is a sign of career progression for an IT professional, often valued even more than an increment.

There are more than 400,000 non-US residents working in the US via the H-1B visa program, and of these, roughly three-quarters are from India, especially in the IT sector.

A lot of Indian IT professionals find US work culture more planned and less ambiguous in comparison to India's, in addition to better labour laws and pay scale.

In the US, often there is no requirement to notify the employer before leaving the job, as either party can terminate the relationship without notice.

Indian-American households have the single-highest income level in the country, which is twice more than the income of the US population, a 2020 Columbia Business School study, says.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit last month, the US said it will ease H-1B visas for skilled Indians and clear the backlog as part of a pilot programme, which will allow Indians to renew the non-immigrant visas in the US without having to travel abroad.

2022-07-22, IANS,7 top tech companies sign deal with US govt on AI guardrails,https://in.investing.com/news/7-top-tech-companies-sign-deal-with-us-govt-on-ai-guardrails-3734368,"Washington, July 22 (IANS) Seven leading artificial intelligence (AI) tech companies like Google (NASDAQ: ), OpenAI and Meta (NASDAQ: ) have reached a deal with the Joe Biden administration to roll out fresh guardrails to manage risks associated with AI.The measures would include testing the security of AI and making the results of those tests public. The companies are Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Anthropic, Meta, Google, Inflection and OpenAI.

""These commitments are real, and they are concrete. AI is going to change the lives of people around the world. The people here will be critical for shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design,"" Biden said at the White House following the meeting late on Friday.

""AI should benefit the whole of society. For that to happen, these powerful new technologies need to be built and deployed responsibly,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.

""As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,"" he added.

As part of the agreement, the tech companies have agreed to security testing of their AI systems by internal and external experts before their release.

This will ensure that people are able to spot AI by implementing watermarks and publicly report AI capabilities and limitations on a regular basis.

These companies will also research the risks such as bias, discrimination and the invasion of privacy.

""This is a serious responsibility, we have to get it right. There's enormous, enormous potential upside as well,"" said Biden.

OpenAI said that the watermarking agreements would require the companies to ""develop tools or APIs to determine if a particular piece of content was created with their system.""

Google has committed to deploy similar disclosures earlier this year.

Earlier this week, Meta said that it would open-source its large language model Llama 2, making it free for researchers, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4.

""Announcing ChatGPT for Android! The app will be rolling out to users next week, and you can pre-order in the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store starting today,"" the company said in a tweet.

The ChatGPT app on Android is more or less identical to the iOS app. The users can sync conversations and preferences across devices too.

The Android rollout is likely to come to US users first and then to other countries but the company was yet to reveal plans.

One can sign up to be notified when the app goes live by hitting ""pre-register"" on the Google Play Store.

OpenAI has also introduced a new ""customised instructions"" feature for ChatGPT, that allows users to share anything with the artificial intelligence (AI)-chatbot for future conversations.

""Custom instructions are currently available in Beta for Plus users, and we plan to roll out to all users soon,"" the company said.

Users can edit or delete custom instructions at any time for new conversations. Moreover, the users' instructions won’t be shared with shared link viewers.

Last month, OpenAI updated the ChatGPT application on iOS, and added Bing integration for Plus plan users.

The company also improved the history search with the update.

Still, the last week marked the eighth green weekly candle for the S&P 500 in the last 10 weeks as the generative AI frenzy keeps fueling the equities bull run.

Nasdaq ( ) lost 0.6% despite a strong rally in the opening days of the last week, ultimately resulting in a shooting star candle – which is a bearish near-term signal for tech-heavy IXIC. A short-term pullback could push the index to revisit important support around 13200, suggesting a pullback of around 6%.

On the other hand, Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) surged 2.1% to finally break out of the tight trading range. Last week’s high marks the highest the DJI index traded since April 2022.

This week is packed with U.S. economic data, starting with preliminary and results for July. The interest rate decision is out on Wednesday with the market fully expecting another – and possibly final – 25 bps rate hike.

""The key question is how strongly [Fed] Chair [Jerome] Powell will nod toward the 'careful pace' of tightening he advocated in June, which we and others have taken to imply an every-other-meeting approach,"" Goldman Sachs strategists said last week.

On Thursday, we will see the preliminary numbers for the second quarter, coupled with the for July. Finally, the - Price Index report is out on Friday.

Mega-caps take the stage

The Q2 earnings season is in full swing after several mega-caps, including (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ), reported last week. So far, 18% of the S&P 500 companies reported actual results with 75% of those reported topping EPS estimates, according to FactSet.

“It’s still too early to determine how the Q2 earnings season will turn out. That said, in our view “so far so good” with five sectors showing positive double digit earnings growth (energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services and real estate), three sectors posting positive single digit earnings growth (consumer staples, health care and financials), and two sectors delivering double digit negative earnings growth (materials and information technology),” Oppenheimer strategists said.

For Q2 2022, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 is -9.0%, which is higher than the expected earnings decline of 7%.

“The (blended) net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q2 2022 is 11.1%, which is below the previous quarter’s net profit margin (11.5%), below the year-ago net profit margin (12.2%), and below the 5-year average (11.4%). If 11.1% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the sixth straight quarter in which the net profit margin for the index has declined year-over-year,” FactSet analysts wrote in a blog post on Friday.

Some of the most notable companies to report this week include General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Wedbush analysts argue that Street’s focus is on Microsoft.

“The entire Street will be laser focused on one print this week: Microsoft. While this is a massive week for Big Tech earnings season there is no better barometer of the overall cloud and enterprise spending environment than Redmond and all eyes will be glued to the screens Tuesday after the bell,” they said in a client note.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Morgan Stanley analysts: “2022 has been a story of higher valuations than we expected amid falling inflation and cost-cutting. However, disinflation is now eating into sales growth, which means investor focus is likely to shift toward top line growers rather than just companies exhibiting cost efficiencies.”

Oppenheimer analysts: “We remain highly constructive on equities on expectations that economic fundamentals are likely to remain resilient if not robust in this period of significant transition tied to monetary policy. Corporations, the consumer and labor continue to reflect in our view resilience characteristic with a recovery process from a period of crisis and great uncertainty into a period of sustainable economic growth.”

Barclays analysts: “Valuations are up and earnings are in the hot seat as we enter the busiest weeks of summer reporting season. Estimates are heading lower for most sectors, while uncertainty is high for Big Tech. Two potential sources of downside: negative operating leverage worsened by faster disinflation, and China exposure.”

Berenberg analysts: “US equities look expensive in both absolute and relative terms compared to non-US equities. Equity bond yield gaps (excluding Japan) have compressed or even reversed in the last 12- 18 months. However, the gap between the US equity-bond yield gap and non-US yield gaps is near historical highs – this suggests more relative support for non-US equities versus local bonds than in the US. In absolute terms, US equities trade above a 12-month forward P/E of 20x for only the third time in the last 50 years; the last two times that US equities have been this expensive were both liquidity-fuelled bubbles.”

Goldman Sachs analysts: “We believe recent valuation expansion despite higher rates is reasonable considering the longer-term relationship between rates and equities, the improvement in expected growth, and the high market concentration in stocks benefiting from AI optimism. While our baseline forecast assumes a slight contraction in the S&P 500 P/E multiple to 19x by year-end, we believe risks to valuations are tilted to the upside if the multiples of laggards “catch up” or yields fall.”"

The broad-based also posted small gains, but the tech-heavy closed 0.2% lower, after poorly received results during the week from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Earnings season kicks into top gear

Helping the generally positive tone has been a largely beneficial earnings season to date, but the quarter kicks into top gear this week with around 40% of the DJIA and 30% of the S&P 500 set to give their financial updates.

This includes tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), although the slate is relatively quiet on Monday, with the focus on the likes of home appliances manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE: ), NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: ) and pizza chain Domino’s (NYSE: ).

Additionally, toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ: ) is set to receive a boost from the strong showing of the ""Barbie"" movie, which recorded the biggest domestic debut of 2022.

Fed meeting key in determining sentiment

Also of crucial importance this week, the is widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points on Wednesday, which may be the final rate hike of its most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in decades.

This thesis has helped buoy stocks in recent weeks, and any indication coming out of the meeting that the policymakers have been discussing further hikes could weigh heavily on Wall Street.

The U.S. economic data slate centers around the latest S&P Global activity data for July, with the flash expected to fall to 54.0 from 54.4 in June and the flash seen rising to 46.4 in July from 46.3.

Crude market pushes higher

They see “a significant opportunity for GPU supplier NVDA” with the TAM (total addressable market) expanding 10 times over the next 5 years to more than $400 billion.

“We see AI server unit penetration reaching ~11% by C27E, and NVDA, with conservative ~75% share (vs. 90%+ today), potentially driving ~$300B in AI-specific revenue,” they said in a client note.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) is expected to have a ~5% of AI server share by 2027. The analysts also highlighted Amazon’s (NASDAQ: ) AWS Inferentia, Tesla’s (NASDAQ: ) Dojo, or Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: ) Google that could capture AI market share gains.

“We see more room to unlock value with solid AI roadmaps accelerating.”

“Assuming $30-100B AI revenues (or ~$65B at the midpoint), we estimate implied share price to reflect AI estimates for C23-25E would be $490-$769/share, and a midpoint at ~$625 PT,” the analysts concluded.

Moreover, users will be able to ask for it directly by saying, “Summarise this”.

The Summarise option is expected to appear when users are browsing through Chrome directly or when an app opens a webpage in a Custom Tab.

However, it is still unclear whether this option will be a Pixel-exclusive feature when it launches.

The Summarise option would be one of the first modern generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features for Google Assistant, the report said.

Last month, the tech giant had introduced two new voices--Lime and Indigo-- for its virtual assistant software application.

Earlier this month, it was reported that the company “deprioritised” its plans to launch an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile chatbot application 'Bubble Characters' specifically designed for Gen Z users, featuring interactive digital characters.

When a product gets deprioritised at Google, the development work on it ceases.

The tech giant had been working on this app since quarter four (Q4) of 2021.

The app’s description mentioned that it featured “human-like” conversations that “take action” and are “interesting for GenZ”.

""From Digital News Initiative (which wasn’t just a Fund - though a wise person did say that it helped kickstart a European media R&D culture) to the Google News Initiative Innovation Challenges - and of course Ludovic Blecher’s brilliant idea: JERF, the Journalism Emergency Relief Fund which showcased the best of Google: helping where it could when a vulnerable part of the news ecosystem needed it most and involving 300 Googlers,"" Chinnappa added.

The company is currently rolling out the update to a small batch of Photos users.

""It's hard not to notice the disappearance of the bottom navigation bar in these screenshots,"" the report said.

Moreover, the current Search tab receives a separate circular floating button to the right in the new version.

The Sharing option which is available on the bottom bar in the current iteration of Photos, has been relocated to the top right of the screen, to the left of the profile image.

The Google Photos logo is also relocated to the top left instead of the centre of the screen.

Earlier this month, the company had added 12 new video effects to the editing suite of Google Photos.

The new effects include Dust Max, Black and White Film, Light Leak and more, reports Android Police.

These effects add a personal touch to the users' videos.

The Poster effect makes the video appear like folded paper, while the Layouts effect offers a neat block-by-block look to the selfie videos.

Meanwhile, last month, it was reported that the tech giant was testing an on-demand cinematic effect feature in its photo sharing and storage service.

The cinematic photo creator was available under the 'Utilities' option for some users in Google Photos' Library tab.

With this feature, users can select a photo and specify the duration of the resulting video, and the app will create a slow-motion zoom animation of that chosen image.

Of the 163,370 individuals who gave up citizenship of India in 2021, a major chunk of 78,284 chose the US as their adoptive country with many saying that the American citizenship was most sought after for “reasons personal to them"".

A record number of Indian students chose the United States to pursue higher education with nearly 21 per cent of the over one million foreign students studying in the US being Indians, according to a recent US High Commission data.

Almost 200,000 Indian students chose America as their higher education destination in the 2021-22 academic year -- a 19 per cent increase over the previous year, according to the Open Doors Report released this year.

Unlike Sundar Pichai, who completed his bachelor’s degree in India before heading abroad to take on Google (NASDAQ: ), most students in India now want to leave for foreign shores immediately after finishing their class 12th. ""The earlier I start, the better it is,"" Snehal Sinha, a 16-year-old commerce student with American dreams, told IANS.

For students and techies in a country with a billion-plus population, the US still means a land of opportunity, offering world-class education, better job prospects, and a chance to build a better life.

The country is home to nearly 4,000 universities known for their high academic standards. An international student has a wide range of choices, regardless of the state in which they choose to study.

India’s domestic education system has grown to be one of the largest in the world, with close to 52,000 institutions. But, despite this expanded access, postgraduate opportunities are still few and far between in the country, which is one of the big reasons students look overseas, notes American International Recruitment Council (AIRC).

As of 2018-19, only 35 per cent of Indian higher education institutions offered postgraduate programs, and 2.5 per cent offered PhD programs, unlike the US with its strong graduate programs and post-study work opportunities.

More than 77 per cent of Indian students in the US studied STEM in the 2020-21 academic year with maths and computer science being the most popular STEM fields, accounting for 35 per cent of Indians in 2020-21.

In 2022, the White House announced additional STEM fields eligible for Optional Practical Training STEM Extension, which provides students with an opportunity to find off-campus employment or an internship within their field of study.

Optional Practical Training allows overseas students with an F-1 visa to work up to 12 months during or after the study duration. Students with STEM degrees get another 12 months and can work up to 24 months.

Another program, the Curricular Practical Training gives international students authorisation to gain employment training and to work in paid internships positions.

The success stories of Indian-origin CEOs Satya Nadella, Shantanu Narayen, and Arvind Krishna have also played a role in attracting Indian students and techies who want to make a mark in Silicon Valley.

An opportunity to “work onsite” and “earn in dollars” has been a big lure for Indian engineers ever since the tech boom swept the country almost two decades ago, says a Quartz report.

It adds that more than anything, a US visa for an Indian is a sign of career progression for an IT professional, often valued even more than an increment.

There are more than 400,000 non-US residents working in the US via the H-1B visa program, and of these, roughly three-quarters are from India, especially in the IT sector.

A lot of Indian IT professionals find US work culture more planned and less ambiguous in comparison to India's, in addition to better labour laws and pay scale.

In the US, often there is no requirement to notify the employer before leaving the job, as either party can terminate the relationship without notice.

Indian-American households have the single-highest income level in the country, which is twice more than the income of the US population, a 2020 Columbia Business School study, says.

After Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit last month, the US said it will ease H-1B visas for skilled Indians and clear the backlog as part of a pilot programme, which will allow Indians to renew the non-immigrant visas in the US without having to travel abroad.

The companies are Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Anthropic, Meta, Google, Inflection and OpenAI.

""These commitments are real, and they are concrete. AI is going to change the lives of people around the world. The people here will be critical for shepherding that innovation with responsibility and safety by design,"" Biden said at the White House following the meeting late on Friday.

""AI should benefit the whole of society. For that to happen, these powerful new technologies need to be built and deployed responsibly,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs.

""As we develop new AI models, tech companies should be transparent about how their systems work and collaborate closely across industry, government, academia and civil society,"" he added.

As part of the agreement, the tech companies have agreed to security testing of their AI systems by internal and external experts before their release.

This will ensure that people are able to spot AI by implementing watermarks and publicly report AI capabilities and limitations on a regular basis.

These companies will also research the risks such as bias, discrimination and the invasion of privacy.

""This is a serious responsibility, we have to get it right. There's enormous, enormous potential upside as well,"" said Biden.

OpenAI said that the watermarking agreements would require the companies to ""develop tools or APIs to determine if a particular piece of content was created with their system.""

Google has committed to deploy similar disclosures earlier this year.

Earlier this week, Meta said that it would open-source its large language model Llama 2, making it free for researchers, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4.

2022-07-21, IANS,Microsoft top impersonated brand for phishing scams in Q2: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-top-impersonated-brand-for-phishing-scams-in-q2-report-3733002,"New Delhi, July 21 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) took the top spot in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022 as the most impersonated brand for phishing scams, a new report showed on Friday. According to Check Point Research, Microsoft climbed up the rankings last quarter, moving from third place in Q1 2022 to the top spot in Q2. The tech giant accounted for 29 per cent of all brand phishing attempts.

Google (NASDAQ: ) ranked second, accounting for 19 per cent of all attempts, and Apple (NASDAQ: ) ranked third, featuring 5 per cent of all phishing events during the last quarter.

In terms of industry, the technology sector was the most impersonated, followed by banking and social media networks.

""While the most impersonated brands move around quarter to quarter, the tactics that cybercriminals use scarcely do. This is because the method of flooding our inboxes and luring us into a false sense of security by using reputable logos has proven successful time and time again,"" said Omer Dembinsky, Data Group Manager at Check Point Software (NASDAQ: ).

Moreover, the report said that American banking organisation Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) took fourth place in Q2 due to a series of malicious emails requesting account information.

Similar tactics were noted in other scams that imitated brands such as Walmart (NYSE: ) and LinkedIn, which also featured in this report's top ten list taking sixth and eighth place.

""For organisations worried about their own data and reputation, it is key that they take advantage of the right technologies that can effectively block these emails before they have chance to dupe a victim,"" Dembinsky said.

Further, the report stated that a brand phishing attack occurs when criminals attempt to imitate the official website of a well-known brand by using a similar domain name or URL and a web page design that is similar to the genuine site.

The link to the fake website can be sent to specific individuals via email or text message, a user can be redirected while browsing the web, or it can be triggered by a fraudulent mobile app.

A form on a fake website is frequently used to steal users' credentials, payment information, or other personal information.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"U.S. stock futures point higher, FTX sues Bankman-Fried - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stock-futures-point-higher-ftx-sues-bankmanfried--whats-moving-markets-3733004,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge up ahead of the final trading day of the week, with investors looking ahead to major tech earnings and a key Federal Reserve interest decision next week. Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

But gains have been tempered as traders exercised caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting. The has also rebounded from a 15-month low ahead of the gathering.

By 05:04 ET, the futures traded 0.78% higher at $76.24 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.74% to $80.23 per barrel."

The bug was, in fact, reported by someone else which was later fixed by Google.The bug was originally found by an Apple employee who was participating in a Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking competition in March, reports TechCrunch.

However, the Apple employee did not report the zero-day bug, meaning Google wasn’t aware of the bug and no patch had been issued yet.

“This issue was reported by sisu from CTF team HXP and discovered by a member of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) during HXP CTF 2022,” the Google employee wrote in the official Bugs blog.

A Google spokesperson said that their understanding is public in the bug.

“We recommend reaching out to Apple for any further details,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Apple did not comment on the report.

It’s not uncommon for CTF teams and CTF players to find zero-days during such competitions.

This bug was apparently discovered during the course of an independent CTF.

Neither Chrome, Google, or the ANGLE team was made aware of this issue via other sources at or prior to it being disclosed.

It had used Facebook's advertising services but had not paid the full amount.

Google (NASDAQ: ), Dunzo's second-largest backer, has recently served a legal notice to the startup, demanding the settlement of unpaid dues.

""Dunzo defaulted in making its payments to FBI under the Contract, despite repeated efforts, verbally and in writing, to rectify the delinquency, Dunzo acknowledged its liabilities and started making the payment to FBI. However, the payment was insufficient to settle all the outstanding balances under the account,” the legal notice read.

According to the report, the demand notices would not exceed Rs 5-6 crore for the startup in total.

While Dunzo was still dealing with Facebook, the report stated that Nilenso, which provides contract software engineers, had also sent Dunzo a demand notice under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for payment of outstanding dues.

The Bengaluru-based startup is still owed around Rs 2.5 crore, after paying around Rs 1 crore from its total outstanding.

As per the report, there is pending litigation between Nilenso and Dunzo.

Meanwhile, Dunzo has said it will not be able to pay employees' salaries until early September, a further delay from the earlier deadline of July 20. The company has also delayed the August salary for senior employees to September 4 as well, it said in an email seen by TechCrunch.

The delay comes as the startup focuses on “streamlining our cash flow so we can build a more sustainable business for the future”, according to the Bengaluru-headquartered startup.

BofA Securities analysts previewed the quarter and expect a modest revenue beat and EPS upside on cost control and other income. The analysts raised their price target to $142 from $128, while maintaining a Buy rating. The new price target suggests more than 16% upside from yesterday’s closing price.

The firm estimates revenue and GAAP EPS of $60.7 billion and $1.42, respectively, versus the consensus of $60.4B and $1.34.

“We expect search & other growth to accelerate 210bps to 4% y/y (FX benefit), with our $42.3bn est above Street at $42.1bn,” they commented. “We expect 2Q core Google margins to be up 64bps y/y on cost savings/layoffs and expect GAAP EPS at $1.42, above Street at $1.34, with investment income (asset mark-ups) driving upside. Based on 3rd party data sources, we think investors are looking for in-line to 1% above Street revs., with extent (or lack of) of cost efficiencies a debate topic.”

Another aspect of discussion centers around the potential effects of integrating LLM (Language Model Models) into search results on revenues and costs. Despite this, BofA analysts hold a positive outlook on the steady growth of search share, which they believe will grant Google the ability to manage the pace of LLM integration effectively.

Overall, the analysts are anticipating 2Q cost-driven upside and potential Search acceleration in 2H due to macro improvements and new AI tools for advertisers. Alphabet is seen as a defensive, self-help stock in 2022 with stronger earning potential."

Google demonstrated the AI tool, reportedly called 'Genesis', for senior media executives presenting ""responsible"" technology that takes in facts and writes a news copy.

Some media executives were quoted as saying that ""it seemed to take for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories,"" while another saw it as more of a personal assistant or helper.

A Google spokesperson said that in partnership with news publishers, especially smaller publishers, ""we're in the earliest stages of exploring ideas to potentially provide AI-enabled tools to help journalists with their work"".

For instance, AI-enabled tools could assist journalists with options for headlines or different writing styles.

""Our goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity, just like we're making assistive tools available for people in Gmail and in Google Docs,"" said the company spokesperson.

These tools, however, are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating and fact-checking their articles, the company noted.

However, AI has so far failed to produce accurate information in several cases.

In June, Gannett, the largest publisher in the US, filed a federal lawsuit against Google for monopolisation of advertising technology markets and deceptive commercial practices.

The lawsuit seeks to restore competition in the digital advertising marketplace and end Google's monopoly, which will encourage investment in newsrooms and news content throughout the country.

Ajax reportedly runs on Google Cloud and was built with Google JAX, the search giant’s machine learning framework.

Apple is leveraging Ajax to create large language models and serve as the foundation for the internal ChatGPT-style tool.

The company did not immediately comment on the report.

According to the report, Apple employees are using the chatbot to help with product prototyping. It is similar to Bard, ChatGPT and Bing AI.

Apple recently doubled down on hirings for generative AI talent. The company is looking for engineers with a “robust understanding of large language models and generative AI.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that the company would use AI on a “thoughtful basis.”

The news came as Meta also joined the AI race, with launching the release of Llama 2, an open-source large language model, with Microsoft.

Llama 2 is available through a variety of providers and free for commercial use and research.

“We’re opening access to Llama 2 with the support of a broad set of companies and people across tech, academia, and policy who also believe in an open innovation approach to today’s AI technologies,” said Meta.

Recent breakthroughs in AI, and generative AI in particular, have captured the public’s imagination and demonstrated what those developing these technologies have long known -- they have the potential to help people do incredible things, create a new era of economic and social opportunities, and give individuals, creators, and businesses new ways to express themselves and connect with people, according to Meta.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"Dow futures climb as rally continues; earnings, Fed meeting in focus",https://in.investing.com/news/dow-futures-climb-as-rally-continues-earnings-fed-meeting-in-focus-3733212,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures traded higher Friday, with sentiment boosted by a generally positive earnings season to date ahead of next week’s crucial Federal Reserve meeting.

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.5%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street closed in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the blue chip gaining over 160 points, or 0.5%. This was its ninth straight positive close and longest streak of increases since 2017, and its highest close since March 2022.

The tech-heavy , however, fell almost 300 points, or 2.1%, its largest one-day decline in over four months, weighed by poorly received results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Positive earnings help sentiment

The earnings season has been largely beneficial so far, with 73% of the companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data.

Banks have dominated the first week, benefiting from rising interest rates, although the major lenders have had to cope with a slump in deal making.

Regional lenders like Comerica (NYSE: ) and Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE: ) end the week, along with credit card giant American Express (NYSE: ), but attention has largely switched to next week and numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Microsoft/Activision deal now more likely

The potential $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) now looks more likely to proceed after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the deal.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, but their opposition has been showing signs of softening.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

Fed meeting looms large

Away from the corporate sector, next week sees a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points.

Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle or signal more hikes ahead is likely to guide sentiment in the weeks ahead.

Oil rises on Chinese stimulus hopes

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, and raising expectations of more widespread support.

By 06:30 ET, the futures traded 1.3% higher at $76.63 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.3% to $80.64. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 1% this week.

Additionally, fell 0.3% to $1,965.75/oz, while traded largely unchanged at 1.1126.

2022-07-21, IANS,Microsoft top impersonated brand for phishing scams in Q2: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/microsoft-top-impersonated-brand-for-phishing-scams-in-q2-report-3733002,"New Delhi, July 21 (IANS) Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) took the top spot in the second quarter (Q2) of 2022 as the most impersonated brand for phishing scams, a new report showed on Friday. According to Check Point Research, Microsoft climbed up the rankings last quarter, moving from third place in Q1 2022 to the top spot in Q2. The tech giant accounted for 29 per cent of all brand phishing attempts.

Google (NASDAQ: ) ranked second, accounting for 19 per cent of all attempts, and Apple (NASDAQ: ) ranked third, featuring 5 per cent of all phishing events during the last quarter.

In terms of industry, the technology sector was the most impersonated, followed by banking and social media networks.

""While the most impersonated brands move around quarter to quarter, the tactics that cybercriminals use scarcely do. This is because the method of flooding our inboxes and luring us into a false sense of security by using reputable logos has proven successful time and time again,"" said Omer Dembinsky, Data Group Manager at Check Point Software (NASDAQ: ).

Moreover, the report said that American banking organisation Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) took fourth place in Q2 due to a series of malicious emails requesting account information.

Similar tactics were noted in other scams that imitated brands such as Walmart (NYSE: ) and LinkedIn, which also featured in this report's top ten list taking sixth and eighth place.

""For organisations worried about their own data and reputation, it is key that they take advantage of the right technologies that can effectively block these emails before they have chance to dupe a victim,"" Dembinsky said.

Further, the report stated that a brand phishing attack occurs when criminals attempt to imitate the official website of a well-known brand by using a similar domain name or URL and a web page design that is similar to the genuine site.

The link to the fake website can be sent to specific individuals via email or text message, a user can be redirected while browsing the web, or it can be triggered by a fraudulent mobile app.

A form on a fake website is frequently used to steal users' credentials, payment information, or other personal information.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"U.S. stock futures point higher, FTX sues Bankman-Fried - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stock-futures-point-higher-ftx-sues-bankmanfried--whats-moving-markets-3733004,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge up ahead of the final trading day of the week, with investors looking ahead to major tech earnings and a key Federal Reserve interest decision next week. Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

But gains have been tempered as traders exercised caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting. The has also rebounded from a 15-month low ahead of the gathering.

By 05:04 ET, the futures traded 0.78% higher at $76.24 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.74% to $80.23 per barrel."

The bug was, in fact, reported by someone else which was later fixed by Google.The bug was originally found by an Apple employee who was participating in a Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking competition in March, reports TechCrunch.

However, the Apple employee did not report the zero-day bug, meaning Google wasn’t aware of the bug and no patch had been issued yet.

“This issue was reported by sisu from CTF team HXP and discovered by a member of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) during HXP CTF 2022,” the Google employee wrote in the official Bugs blog.

A Google spokesperson said that their understanding is public in the bug.

“We recommend reaching out to Apple for any further details,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

Apple did not comment on the report.

It’s not uncommon for CTF teams and CTF players to find zero-days during such competitions.

This bug was apparently discovered during the course of an independent CTF.

Neither Chrome, Google, or the ANGLE team was made aware of this issue via other sources at or prior to it being disclosed.

It had used Facebook's advertising services but had not paid the full amount.

Google (NASDAQ: ), Dunzo's second-largest backer, has recently served a legal notice to the startup, demanding the settlement of unpaid dues.

""Dunzo defaulted in making its payments to FBI under the Contract, despite repeated efforts, verbally and in writing, to rectify the delinquency, Dunzo acknowledged its liabilities and started making the payment to FBI. However, the payment was insufficient to settle all the outstanding balances under the account,” the legal notice read.

According to the report, the demand notices would not exceed Rs 5-6 crore for the startup in total.

While Dunzo was still dealing with Facebook, the report stated that Nilenso, which provides contract software engineers, had also sent Dunzo a demand notice under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for payment of outstanding dues.

The Bengaluru-based startup is still owed around Rs 2.5 crore, after paying around Rs 1 crore from its total outstanding.

As per the report, there is pending litigation between Nilenso and Dunzo.

Meanwhile, Dunzo has said it will not be able to pay employees' salaries until early September, a further delay from the earlier deadline of July 20. The company has also delayed the August salary for senior employees to September 4 as well, it said in an email seen by TechCrunch.

The delay comes as the startup focuses on “streamlining our cash flow so we can build a more sustainable business for the future”, according to the Bengaluru-headquartered startup.

BofA Securities analysts previewed the quarter and expect a modest revenue beat and EPS upside on cost control and other income. The analysts raised their price target to $142 from $128, while maintaining a Buy rating. The new price target suggests more than 16% upside from yesterday’s closing price.

The firm estimates revenue and GAAP EPS of $60.7 billion and $1.42, respectively, versus the consensus of $60.4B and $1.34.

“We expect search & other growth to accelerate 210bps to 4% y/y (FX benefit), with our $42.3bn est above Street at $42.1bn,” they commented. “We expect 2Q core Google margins to be up 64bps y/y on cost savings/layoffs and expect GAAP EPS at $1.42, above Street at $1.34, with investment income (asset mark-ups) driving upside. Based on 3rd party data sources, we think investors are looking for in-line to 1% above Street revs., with extent (or lack of) of cost efficiencies a debate topic.”

Another aspect of discussion centers around the potential effects of integrating LLM (Language Model Models) into search results on revenues and costs. Despite this, BofA analysts hold a positive outlook on the steady growth of search share, which they believe will grant Google the ability to manage the pace of LLM integration effectively.

Overall, the analysts are anticipating 2Q cost-driven upside and potential Search acceleration in 2H due to macro improvements and new AI tools for advertisers. Alphabet is seen as a defensive, self-help stock in 2022 with stronger earning potential."

Google demonstrated the AI tool, reportedly called 'Genesis', for senior media executives presenting ""responsible"" technology that takes in facts and writes a news copy.

Some media executives were quoted as saying that ""it seemed to take for granted the effort that went into producing accurate and artful news stories,"" while another saw it as more of a personal assistant or helper.

A Google spokesperson said that in partnership with news publishers, especially smaller publishers, ""we're in the earliest stages of exploring ideas to potentially provide AI-enabled tools to help journalists with their work"".

For instance, AI-enabled tools could assist journalists with options for headlines or different writing styles.

""Our goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity, just like we're making assistive tools available for people in Gmail and in Google Docs,"" said the company spokesperson.

These tools, however, are not intended to, and cannot, replace the essential role journalists have in reporting, creating and fact-checking their articles, the company noted.

However, AI has so far failed to produce accurate information in several cases.

In June, Gannett, the largest publisher in the US, filed a federal lawsuit against Google for monopolisation of advertising technology markets and deceptive commercial practices.

The lawsuit seeks to restore competition in the digital advertising marketplace and end Google's monopoly, which will encourage investment in newsrooms and news content throughout the country.

Ajax reportedly runs on Google Cloud and was built with Google JAX, the search giant’s machine learning framework.

Apple is leveraging Ajax to create large language models and serve as the foundation for the internal ChatGPT-style tool.

The company did not immediately comment on the report.

According to the report, Apple employees are using the chatbot to help with product prototyping. It is similar to Bard, ChatGPT and Bing AI.

Apple recently doubled down on hirings for generative AI talent. The company is looking for engineers with a “robust understanding of large language models and generative AI.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that the company would use AI on a “thoughtful basis.”

The news came as Meta also joined the AI race, with launching the release of Llama 2, an open-source large language model, with Microsoft.

Llama 2 is available through a variety of providers and free for commercial use and research.

“We’re opening access to Llama 2 with the support of a broad set of companies and people across tech, academia, and policy who also believe in an open innovation approach to today’s AI technologies,” said Meta.

Recent breakthroughs in AI, and generative AI in particular, have captured the public’s imagination and demonstrated what those developing these technologies have long known -- they have the potential to help people do incredible things, create a new era of economic and social opportunities, and give individuals, creators, and businesses new ways to express themselves and connect with people, according to Meta.

In the “Impact Theory” podcast hosted by Tom Bilyeu on YouTube, Gawdat told humans will soon be able to simulate sex using virtual reality and augmented reality headsets like Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Vision Pro or a Quest 3.

The headsets integrated with AI-powered bots will deceive people into thinking that the sex robot is real.

“Just think about all of the illusions that we’re now unable to decipher. But if we can convince you that this sex robot is alive, or that sex experience in a virtual reality headset or an augmented reality headset is alive, it’s real, then there you go,” Gawdat told Bilyeu.

He further said that technological advances would enable computer-backed systems to interface with the human brain and give it the impression of interacting with a peer.

“If we think a few years further and think of Neuralink and other ways of connecting directly to your nervous system, and why would you need another being in the first place?” the former Google exec said.

Referencing real-life human relationships, he said: ""You know, that’s actually quite messy"".

Moreover, he stated that even the mental and emotional stimuli associated with intimacy can be artificially recreated, the report mentioned. “It’s all signals in your brain that you enjoy companionship, and sexuality, and -- if you really want to take the magic out of it -- it can be simulated,” Gawdat said.

In response to the raging debate over AI-powered bots being considered ""sentient,"" he said the issue does not matter if a human brain believes them to be real.

The Workspace Labs program is currently available to trusted testers in US English.

The new 'Generate a background' feature is available in Meet for desktop.

The tech giant also mentioned that generated images are for use only within Google Meet.

""Workspace Labs generated images are designed to bring your imagination to life in Meet, and may not represent real world situations,"" it explained.

The company also warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

To use the new feature, users have to open meet.google.com and select a meeting.

Then at the bottom right of the self view, click Apply visual effects> Generate a background.

There, users will be able to enter a prompt. For example, ""Luxurious living room interior"" or ""A magical sunny forest glade.""

By hovering the mouse on top of their own video feed, users can access video effects such as immersive backgrounds or fun filters to bring more fun to their meetings and a reframing option to improve their visibility.

Users can also turn off the video feed from other participants using the quick action on their video.

This can be helpful when users want to focus their meeting view on just the presenter or hide participants with distracting video feeds.

""This update is especially impactful for company-wide announcements, event-oriented spaces, large communities within companies, and support-related spaces.""

With the new feature, the company aims to not only help increase connectivity and a sense of belonging but also create broader and more thriving communities within the organisations.

Moreover, the tech giant introduced the ability to easily search for members within a space.

""If a member is present, you can change their role and if a member is not present, you can add the member to the space,"" it added.

The features do not have admin control, and are available to all Google Workspace customers.

In March this year, the tech giant had announced that it was rolling out new features for space managers in Google Chat, including the ability to decide if members can add or remove members or groups to a space.

Also, the company had introduced the ""Space configuration"" feature which allows space managers to choose if members can change space details, such as name, icon, description, and guidelines, or turn Chat history on/off for the space.

On the other hand, the ""Conversation moderation"" feature ""authorises space managers to determine whether members can use @all in a space.""

Meanwhile, last week, the company had introduced a new media viewer for Google Chat on Android devices, which improves the media browsing experience.

The company also added a shared media option that allows users to quickly browse through all media shared in a Chat conversation, which is accessible from the conversation as well as from the full-screen view of every media item.

2022-07-18, IANS,US lawmaker moves bill to double H-1B visas,https://in.investing.com/news/us-lawmaker-moves-bill-to-double-h1b-visas-3728725,"Washington, July 19 (IANS) A US lawmaker has introduced legislation proposing to double the annual intake of foreign workers on H-1B visas, a short-term work permit that has been a gateway for Indians to work, live and, eventually, seek citizenship of this country.The bill introduced last Friday by Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Indian-descent Democratic lawmaker, seeks to boost the annual H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.

The US runs the H-1B visa programme to make up for the shortage of speciality workers, although critics have argued that the shortage is highly exaggerated and that the programme is being used by American companies to use less expensive foreign workers brought here by IT services companies.

An estimated 75 per cent of the H-1B visa granted in a year add up to 85,000 -- 65,000 workers hired abroad and 20,000 recruited from foreign students enrolled in US colleges and universities -- are known to go workers from India, hired by some of the largest US tech giant such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) as well as IT services behemoths like Infosys (NS: ), TCS (NS: ) and Wipro (NS: ).

Krishnamoorthi said in a press announcement on Tuesday that the expansion of the H-1B visa programme will help American companies get workers for direly needed positions. He is calling the legislation the HIRE Act, short for High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment.

“Creating jobs and building the economy of the future requires us to lead the way in technology by developing our domestic workforce while drawing the best talent from around the world,” said Krishnamoorthi. “That is why I am proud to introduce the HIRE Act to increase investments in elementary and secondary school STEM education while doubling the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. By investing in our homegrown talent while attracting the best minds from around the world, we can create better-paying jobs and harness the technology of tomorrow.”

The legislation also seeks to address the shortage of skilled workers at home here in the US by funding STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering and Math) streams in schools.

“The US needs to maintain its leadership in technology and innovation,” Vinay Mahajan, president of an advocacy group for IT services companies, said in the same announcement. “The startup eco-system needs to be supercharged. One critical component of both is high-skilled workers. The US has a large skills gap -- availability of workers vs the openings for talent in IT. The HIRE Act focuses on reducing this gap through high-skilled immigration and funding for growing local STEM talent. We need the brightest minds from all over the world to keep our wide lead in technology and innovation.”

2022-07-18, Investing.com,KeyBanc raises price target on Alphabet and these 2 Internet stocks into Q2 EPS,https://in.investing.com/news/keybanc-raises-price-target-on-alphabet-and-these-2-internet-stocks-into-q2-eps-432SI-3728035,"KeyBanc analysts raised their price target on several internet stocks Tuesday, following a Q2 preview of the sector. The analysts said they are seeing some signs of an ad recovery, which has them more positive.

""We believe the ad market improved modestly over the course of 2Q, which should drive positive revisions and support multiples across the group,"" they commented.

Sentiment across digital advertising is also improving the analysts note. ""Our checks suggest the ad market improved over the course of the quarter, which should drive better results across companies. Coupled with cost-savings initiatives, we expect to see margin improvements across companies.""

The firm raised its price target on Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) to $140 from $122, while reiterating an Overweight rating. They see upside to Q2 EPS estimates as search and YouTube recover and cost savings initiatives take hold. The firm sees Q2 EPS of $1.38, versus the consensus of $1.34. The firm is also raising 2022 and 2024 EPS estimates by 2% and 1%, respectively, to $5.50 and $6.43 to reflect an ad market recovery and they introduce a 2025 EPS estimate of $7.13.

They also raised their price target on Pinterest (NYSE: ) to $35.00 (from $32.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating. They expect Q2 revenue of a least $700 million, which would be in line with consensus, and see Q3 revenue guidance of at least $738M, representing 8% growth. They see Q3 EBITDA guidance of at least $94M and expect management to reaffirm 2022E targets for margin expansion. The firm modestly raised 2022 and 2024 revenue and EBITDA estimates by less than 1%. ""We believe the combination of accelerating growth, margin expansion, and potential for Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and other partnerships to ramp creates an upward bias to estimates,"" the analysts added.

In addition, the firm raised its price target on The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: ) to $100.00 (from $75.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating. They expect Q2 revenue of at least $463M, versus the consensus of $453 million and see Q3 revenue guidance of at least $480M, which would be slightly above the Street. “Big picture, we believe CTV and retail media create a meaningful tailwind to revenue and EBITDA, with several catalysts ahead (e.g., budget shift from linear TV, EU’s Digital Markets Act, MediaMath’s bankruptcy),” the analysts commented. They raised 2022 and 2024 revenue estimates by 1% and 3%, respectively, and EBITDA by 1% and less than 1%.

Elsewhere in the sector, the analysts maintained an Overweight rating and $335 price target on Meta (NASDAQ: ), where they expect a solid print and Q3 guidance. Meanwhile, they maintained a Sector Weight rating on Roku (NASDAQ: ) and Snap (NYSE: ) saying while they both could benefit from multiple expansion in the sector, they don’t expect a “thesis-changing quarter” for either."

The first option lists frequently used rooms for users to pick from, while the second uses the structured meeting rooms feature to suggest rooms based on meeting attendees' self-selected working location.

Structured meeting rooms are rooms that are assigned to specific buildings, with meeting hardware and capacity information.

In order to better optimise meeting rooms and foster greater collaboration, especially in a hybrid work environment, the company is combining the two options in an updated structured meeting room setting.

""The working location set by a user is taken into account for all room suggestions, and in cases where location data is unavailable, proposed meeting rooms will be based on frequently used rooms,"" the company said.

This update will be helpful as it manages meeting rooms more efficiently by taking planned working locations into account.

""As a result, meeting rooms are only allocated for those who are most likely to need them,"" Google explained.

The company further mentioned that working location must be enabled or a main office building must be set for the users in the admins’ domain to access this feature.

Earlier this month, the tech giant had announced that it was rolling out a feature to set working locations in Calendar.

Since 2021, users have been able to indicate where they are working from directly in Google Calendar.

Now, with the new option, users can set working locations in Calendar that ""indicate where you’re working for specific portions of the day"".

This feature helps users to more accurately reflect their availability based on the physical location they set, which can change throughout the day.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Alphabet riding high on AI rollout

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) stock bumped higher Thursday after it said it was rolling out its artificial-intelligence chatbot, Bard, in Europe and Brazil, as the tech giant looks to take the AI fight to rival ChatGPT.

Morgan Stanley said in a note that Google Search, which still makes up the bulk of Alphabet’s revenue, will likely become ""more personalized” and develop “critical competitive moats” as the tech giant invests further in AI.

The analyst also said Alphabet remains ""in the best position to disrupt/improve its own business"" via AI, noting:

It is still early in AI adoption, and it will likely require new innovation and tools to further accelerate adoption. This, in our view, should help GOOGL manage the user and behavior transition and minimize near-term impacts on revenue and monetization.

GOOGL shares climbed more than 6% for the week to $125.42.

Elon Musk launches xAI

Elon Musk got in the AI battle as well with the launch of his xAI artificial intelligence outfit Wednesday.

Musk has repeatedly issued warnings regarding AI in the past, and signed a letter in March that called the scramble for AI dominance ""an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control.""

Musk said his plan for building safer AI includes rendering it ""maximally curious"" instead of attempting to program in morality, noting, ""I think it is going to be pro-humanity from the standpoint that humanity is just much more interesting than not-humanity.""

In addition to this new role, Musk also famously leads Tesla (NASDAQ: ), SpaceX, and Twitter.

Coinbase propels higher on court victory for Ripple Labs

Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) shares soared Thursday after a federal court ruled that blockchain firm Ripple Labs did not violate federal securities law in selling its blockchain currency, , on public exchanges.

After the news, Needham & Company kept Coinbase's Buy rating and raised its price target to $120 from the prior $70.

Needham said the summary judgment constituted ""a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws. We believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.""

The analyst also provided a recap of the summary judgment:

1. Inst. sales (i.e. initial XRP token sales): granted the SEC's motion that these sales violated securities laws. 2. Programmatic sales (secondary XRP sales on crypto exchanges): denied the SEC's motion; these sales did not constitute an investment contract. 3. Other non-cash distributions: denied the SEC's motion, these distributions did not have an exchange of money, thus did not qualify as an investment contract.

Research firm Berenberg, for its part, does not believe the rally is justified and argues that the ruling does not necessarily constitute a definitive victory for Coinbase. The firm maintained its Hold rating on the stock, as well as its $39 price target.

Coinbase shares finished the week up 33% to $105.31.

Analysts applaud Salesforce plan to raise prices

Salesforce (NYSE: ) shares advanced Tuesday after the company said it would hike list prices on its products starting next month, noting that this was the first increase in seven years.

Specifically, the company will charge an average of 9% more for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau.

Evercore ISI believes the move is reasonable and could provide a potential tailwind for earnings:

While there will clearly be some complaints from customers about the price increase, after a 7 year hiatus, we believe that a 9% increase is pretty reasonable given that other SaaS companies have passed through annual increases in the 4-5% range.

Needham & Company meanwhile hiked the stock's price target to $250 from the prior $230, arguing that the higher prices offer an ""opportunity for top and bottom line benefit.""

After Salesforce's roughly 4% climb on Tuesday, shares continued drifting higher and ultimately finished the week up 9.5% to $229.33.

2022-07-16, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3725097,"Investing.com -- Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear, the U.S. and China release economic data and inflation figures out of the U.K. will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike. Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.

1. Earnings time

Second-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ: ) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with expected on Wednesday.

Tesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) recently dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the ’s rally.

There are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.

A slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE: ) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Philip Morris (NYSE: ).

2. U.S. economic data

Investors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on , and . High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.

There will also be reports on activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on .

3. China economic data

A flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.

Gross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.

However, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.

Mounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.

4. U.K. inflation

The U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike.

The headline consumer price index is expected to ease to year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.

In its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.

This could make August’s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.

5. Oil prices

Oil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.

""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.

Oil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.

Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally.

2022-07-19, IANS,AI-powered sex robots will eliminate need for human partner in bed: Ex-Google exec,https://in.investing.com/news/aipowered-sex-robots-will-eliminate-need-for-human-partner-in-bed-exgoogle-exec-3730091,"San Francisco, July 19 (IANS) An ex-Google executive has predicted that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered sex robots would seem 'alive' and eliminate the need for a human partner in the bedroom.Mohammad ""Mo"" Gawdat, the former chief business officer of Google (NASDAQ: )'s clandestine research-and-development arm X, stated that AI will usher in a ""redesign of love and relationships"" in which people will be unable to distinguish between real-life sexual encounters and those created artificially, reports New York Post.

In the “Impact Theory” podcast hosted by Tom Bilyeu on YouTube, Gawdat told humans will soon be able to simulate sex using virtual reality and augmented reality headsets like Apple (NASDAQ: )'s Vision Pro or a Quest 3.

The headsets integrated with AI-powered bots will deceive people into thinking that the sex robot is real.

“Just think about all of the illusions that we’re now unable to decipher. But if we can convince you that this sex robot is alive, or that sex experience in a virtual reality headset or an augmented reality headset is alive, it’s real, then there you go,” Gawdat told Bilyeu.

He further said that technological advances would enable computer-backed systems to interface with the human brain and give it the impression of interacting with a peer.

“If we think a few years further and think of Neuralink and other ways of connecting directly to your nervous system, and why would you need another being in the first place?” the former Google exec said.

Referencing real-life human relationships, he said: ""You know, that’s actually quite messy"".

Moreover, he stated that even the mental and emotional stimuli associated with intimacy can be artificially recreated, the report mentioned. “It’s all signals in your brain that you enjoy companionship, and sexuality, and -- if you really want to take the magic out of it -- it can be simulated,” Gawdat said.

In response to the raging debate over AI-powered bots being considered ""sentient,"" he said the issue does not matter if a human brain believes them to be real.

2022-07-19, IANS,Google Meet to soon let users create AI-generated background images,https://in.investing.com/news/google-meet-to-soon-let-users-create-aigenerated-background-images-3729553,"San Francisco, July 19 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) has announced that it is testing a new feature in Meet, which allows users to create background images with artificial intelligence (AI).The feature is in testing under Workspace Labs, which is a trusted tester program for users to try new AI features by invitation, the company said in a support page.

The Workspace Labs program is currently available to trusted testers in US English.

The new 'Generate a background' feature is available in Meet for desktop.

The tech giant also mentioned that generated images are for use only within Google Meet.

""Workspace Labs generated images are designed to bring your imagination to life in Meet, and may not represent real world situations,"" it explained.

The company also warned to not provide any personal, confidential or sensitive information while using the feature.

To use the new feature, users have to open meet.google.com and select a meeting.

Then at the bottom right of the self view, click Apply visual effects> Generate a background.

There, users will be able to enter a prompt. For example, ""Luxurious living room interior"" or ""A magical sunny forest glade.""

Moreover, users will be able to create an AI-generated background image during a meeting.

Last month, the tech giant had introduced a new quick action for Meet on web, which allows users to easily access popular features.

By hovering the mouse on top of their own video feed, users can access video effects such as immersive backgrounds or fun filters to bring more fun to their meetings and a reframing option to improve their visibility.

Users can also turn off the video feed from other participants using the quick action on their video.

This can be helpful when users want to focus their meeting view on just the presenter or hide participants with distracting video feeds.

""This update is especially impactful for company-wide announcements, event-oriented spaces, large communities within companies, and support-related spaces.""

With the new feature, the company aims to not only help increase connectivity and a sense of belonging but also create broader and more thriving communities within the organisations.

Moreover, the tech giant introduced the ability to easily search for members within a space.

""If a member is present, you can change their role and if a member is not present, you can add the member to the space,"" it added.

The features do not have admin control, and are available to all Google Workspace customers.

In March this year, the tech giant had announced that it was rolling out new features for space managers in Google Chat, including the ability to decide if members can add or remove members or groups to a space.

Also, the company had introduced the ""Space configuration"" feature which allows space managers to choose if members can change space details, such as name, icon, description, and guidelines, or turn Chat history on/off for the space.

On the other hand, the ""Conversation moderation"" feature ""authorises space managers to determine whether members can use @all in a space.""

Meanwhile, last week, the company had introduced a new media viewer for Google Chat on Android devices, which improves the media browsing experience.

The company also added a shared media option that allows users to quickly browse through all media shared in a Chat conversation, which is accessible from the conversation as well as from the full-screen view of every media item.

2022-07-18, IANS,US lawmaker moves bill to double H-1B visas,https://in.investing.com/news/us-lawmaker-moves-bill-to-double-h1b-visas-3728725,"Washington, July 19 (IANS) A US lawmaker has introduced legislation proposing to double the annual intake of foreign workers on H-1B visas, a short-term work permit that has been a gateway for Indians to work, live and, eventually, seek citizenship of this country.The bill introduced last Friday by Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Indian-descent Democratic lawmaker, seeks to boost the annual H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.

The US runs the H-1B visa programme to make up for the shortage of speciality workers, although critics have argued that the shortage is highly exaggerated and that the programme is being used by American companies to use less expensive foreign workers brought here by IT services companies.

An estimated 75 per cent of the H-1B visa granted in a year add up to 85,000 -- 65,000 workers hired abroad and 20,000 recruited from foreign students enrolled in US colleges and universities -- are known to go workers from India, hired by some of the largest US tech giant such as Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) as well as IT services behemoths like Infosys (NS: ), TCS (NS: ) and Wipro (NS: ).

Krishnamoorthi said in a press announcement on Tuesday that the expansion of the H-1B visa programme will help American companies get workers for direly needed positions. He is calling the legislation the HIRE Act, short for High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment.

“Creating jobs and building the economy of the future requires us to lead the way in technology by developing our domestic workforce while drawing the best talent from around the world,” said Krishnamoorthi. “That is why I am proud to introduce the HIRE Act to increase investments in elementary and secondary school STEM education while doubling the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. By investing in our homegrown talent while attracting the best minds from around the world, we can create better-paying jobs and harness the technology of tomorrow.”

The legislation also seeks to address the shortage of skilled workers at home here in the US by funding STEM (Science, Tech, Engineering and Math) streams in schools.

“The US needs to maintain its leadership in technology and innovation,” Vinay Mahajan, president of an advocacy group for IT services companies, said in the same announcement. “The startup eco-system needs to be supercharged. One critical component of both is high-skilled workers. The US has a large skills gap -- availability of workers vs the openings for talent in IT. The HIRE Act focuses on reducing this gap through high-skilled immigration and funding for growing local STEM talent. We need the brightest minds from all over the world to keep our wide lead in technology and innovation.”

2022-07-18, Investing.com,KeyBanc raises price target on Alphabet and these 2 Internet stocks into Q2 EPS,https://in.investing.com/news/keybanc-raises-price-target-on-alphabet-and-these-2-internet-stocks-into-q2-eps-432SI-3728035,"KeyBanc analysts raised their price target on several internet stocks Tuesday, following a Q2 preview of the sector. The analysts said they are seeing some signs of an ad recovery, which has them more positive.

""We believe the ad market improved modestly over the course of 2Q, which should drive positive revisions and support multiples across the group,"" they commented.

Sentiment across digital advertising is also improving the analysts note. ""Our checks suggest the ad market improved over the course of the quarter, which should drive better results across companies. Coupled with cost-savings initiatives, we expect to see margin improvements across companies.""

The firm raised its price target on Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) to $140 from $122, while reiterating an Overweight rating. They see upside to Q2 EPS estimates as search and YouTube recover and cost savings initiatives take hold. The firm sees Q2 EPS of $1.38, versus the consensus of $1.34. The firm is also raising 2022 and 2024 EPS estimates by 2% and 1%, respectively, to $5.50 and $6.43 to reflect an ad market recovery and they introduce a 2025 EPS estimate of $7.13.

They also raised their price target on Pinterest (NYSE: ) to $35.00 (from $32.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating. They expect Q2 revenue of a least $700 million, which would be in line with consensus, and see Q3 revenue guidance of at least $738M, representing 8% growth. They see Q3 EBITDA guidance of at least $94M and expect management to reaffirm 2022E targets for margin expansion. The firm modestly raised 2022 and 2024 revenue and EBITDA estimates by less than 1%. ""We believe the combination of accelerating growth, margin expansion, and potential for Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and other partnerships to ramp creates an upward bias to estimates,"" the analysts added.

In addition, the firm raised its price target on The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: ) to $100.00 (from $75.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating. They expect Q2 revenue of at least $463M, versus the consensus of $453 million and see Q3 revenue guidance of at least $480M, which would be slightly above the Street. “Big picture, we believe CTV and retail media create a meaningful tailwind to revenue and EBITDA, with several catalysts ahead (e.g., budget shift from linear TV, EU’s Digital Markets Act, MediaMath’s bankruptcy),” the analysts commented. They raised 2022 and 2024 revenue estimates by 1% and 3%, respectively, and EBITDA by 1% and less than 1%.

Elsewhere in the sector, the analysts maintained an Overweight rating and $335 price target on Meta (NASDAQ: ), where they expect a solid print and Q3 guidance. Meanwhile, they maintained a Sector Weight rating on Roku (NASDAQ: ) and Snap (NYSE: ) saying while they both could benefit from multiple expansion in the sector, they don’t expect a “thesis-changing quarter” for either."

The first option lists frequently used rooms for users to pick from, while the second uses the structured meeting rooms feature to suggest rooms based on meeting attendees' self-selected working location.

Structured meeting rooms are rooms that are assigned to specific buildings, with meeting hardware and capacity information.

In order to better optimise meeting rooms and foster greater collaboration, especially in a hybrid work environment, the company is combining the two options in an updated structured meeting room setting.

""The working location set by a user is taken into account for all room suggestions, and in cases where location data is unavailable, proposed meeting rooms will be based on frequently used rooms,"" the company said.

This update will be helpful as it manages meeting rooms more efficiently by taking planned working locations into account.

""As a result, meeting rooms are only allocated for those who are most likely to need them,"" Google explained.

The company further mentioned that working location must be enabled or a main office building must be set for the users in the admins’ domain to access this feature.

Earlier this month, the tech giant had announced that it was rolling out a feature to set working locations in Calendar.

Since 2021, users have been able to indicate where they are working from directly in Google Calendar.

Now, with the new option, users can set working locations in Calendar that ""indicate where you’re working for specific portions of the day"".

This feature helps users to more accurately reflect their availability based on the physical location they set, which can change throughout the day.

It appears that pressure changes, ultrasonic signals, a plane's Wi-Fi signal and the booking activity for travel would work as potential triggers, the report said.

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of tech this week: AI moves from Alphabet and Elon Musk; a Coinbase surge on a court win; and Salesforce's price hike.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Alphabet riding high on AI rollout

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) stock bumped higher Thursday after it said it was rolling out its artificial-intelligence chatbot, Bard, in Europe and Brazil, as the tech giant looks to take the AI fight to rival ChatGPT.

Morgan Stanley said in a note that Google Search, which still makes up the bulk of Alphabet’s revenue, will likely become ""more personalized” and develop “critical competitive moats” as the tech giant invests further in AI.

The analyst also said Alphabet remains ""in the best position to disrupt/improve its own business"" via AI, noting:

It is still early in AI adoption, and it will likely require new innovation and tools to further accelerate adoption. This, in our view, should help GOOGL manage the user and behavior transition and minimize near-term impacts on revenue and monetization.

GOOGL shares climbed more than 6% for the week to $125.42.

Elon Musk launches xAI

Elon Musk got in the AI battle as well with the launch of his xAI artificial intelligence outfit Wednesday.

Musk has repeatedly issued warnings regarding AI in the past, and signed a letter in March that called the scramble for AI dominance ""an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one - not even their creators - can understand, predict, or reliably control.""

Musk said his plan for building safer AI includes rendering it ""maximally curious"" instead of attempting to program in morality, noting, ""I think it is going to be pro-humanity from the standpoint that humanity is just much more interesting than not-humanity.""

In addition to this new role, Musk also famously leads Tesla (NASDAQ: ), SpaceX, and Twitter.

Coinbase propels higher on court victory for Ripple Labs

Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) shares soared Thursday after a federal court ruled that blockchain firm Ripple Labs did not violate federal securities law in selling its blockchain currency, , on public exchanges.

After the news, Needham & Company kept Coinbase's Buy rating and raised its price target to $120 from the prior $70.

Needham said the summary judgment constituted ""a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws. We believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.""

The analyst also provided a recap of the summary judgment:

1. Inst. sales (i.e. initial XRP token sales): granted the SEC's motion that these sales violated securities laws. 2. Programmatic sales (secondary XRP sales on crypto exchanges): denied the SEC's motion; these sales did not constitute an investment contract. 3. Other non-cash distributions: denied the SEC's motion, these distributions did not have an exchange of money, thus did not qualify as an investment contract.

Research firm Berenberg, for its part, does not believe the rally is justified and argues that the ruling does not necessarily constitute a definitive victory for Coinbase. The firm maintained its Hold rating on the stock, as well as its $39 price target.

Coinbase shares finished the week up 33% to $105.31.

Analysts applaud Salesforce plan to raise prices

Salesforce (NYSE: ) shares advanced Tuesday after the company said it would hike list prices on its products starting next month, noting that this was the first increase in seven years.

Specifically, the company will charge an average of 9% more for Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Marketing Cloud, Industries and Tableau.

Evercore ISI believes the move is reasonable and could provide a potential tailwind for earnings:

While there will clearly be some complaints from customers about the price increase, after a 7 year hiatus, we believe that a 9% increase is pretty reasonable given that other SaaS companies have passed through annual increases in the 4-5% range.

Needham & Company meanwhile hiked the stock's price target to $250 from the prior $230, arguing that the higher prices offer an ""opportunity for top and bottom line benefit.""

After Salesforce's roughly 4% climb on Tuesday, shares continued drifting higher and ultimately finished the week up 9.5% to $229.33.

2022-07-16, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3725097,"Investing.com -- Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear, the U.S. and China release economic data and inflation figures out of the U.K. will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike. Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.

1. Earnings time

Second-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ: ) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with expected on Wednesday.

Tesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) recently dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the ’s rally.

There are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.

A slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE: ) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Philip Morris (NYSE: ).

2. U.S. economic data

U.S. retail sales data for June on Tuesday is expected to show an increase of , boosted by rebounding auto sales and higher gasoline station sales, indicating that consumer demand remains resilient.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on , and . High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.

There will also be reports on activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on .

3. China economic data

A flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.

Gross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.

However, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.

Mounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.

4. U.K. inflation

The U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike.

The headline consumer price index is expected to ease to year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.

In its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.

This could make August’s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.

5. Oil prices

Oil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.

""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.

Oil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.

""CM3leon is the first multimodal model trained with a recipe adapted from text-only language models, including a large-scale retrieval-augmented pre-training stage and a second multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage,"" Meta said in a blogpost on Friday.

With CM3leon's capabilities, the company said that the image generation tools can produce more coherent imagery that better follows the input prompts.

According to Meta, CM3leon requires only five times the computing power and a smaller training dataset than previous transformer-based methods.

When compared to the most widely used image generation benchmark (zero-shot MS-COCO), CM3Leon achieved an FID (Frechet Inception Distance) score of 4.88, establishing a new state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation and outperforming Google (NASDAQ: )'s text-to-image model, Parti.

Moreover, the tech giant said that CM3leon excels at a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering and long-form captioning.

CM3Leon's zero-shot performance compares favourably to larger models trained on larger datasets, despite training on a dataset of only three billion text tokens.

""With the goal of creating high-quality generative models, we believe CM3leon’s strong performance across a variety of tasks is a step toward higher-fidelity image generation and understanding,"" Meta said.

""Models like CM3leon could ultimately help boost creativity and better applications in the metaverse. We look forward to exploring the boundaries of multimodal language models and releasing more models in the future,"" it added.

2022-07-14, Investing.com,"Expedia kills Hopper deal, but analysts worry 'cat is out of the bag'",https://in.investing.com/news/expedia-kills-hopper-deal-but-analysts-worry-cat-is-out-of-the-bag-432SI-3723937,"Expedia (NASDAQ: ) has decided to end its partnership with rival online travel agency (OTA) Hopper, stemming from concerns about several practices they perceive as anti-consumer. The news was first reported by the website Skift on Wednesday.

""Expedia Group terminated its supply relationship with Hopper today,"" an Expedia Group spokesperson told Skift. ""The reasons for termination are simple: As Hopper’s product has evolved, we have determined that its features exploit consumer anxiety and confuse customers, leading them to purchase services they neither need nor fully understand. As leaders in powering the B2B travel market, we have a commitment to travelers and to our supply partners that we take very seriously, and, as such, we are ceasing placing our trusted supplier content on the Hopper platform.""

Commenting on that news, Bernstein analysts said the lack of a press release from Expedia shows this is ""likely immaterial to its own results"" however, ""it is illustrative of competitive pressures in the OTA industry today.""

While Expedia said the reason was that Hopper was exploiting customer anxiety, Hopper has suggested that the decision is more ""anti-competitive"". Clark thinks both are likely true.

The analysts have noted in the past that Hopper has been a key market share gainer in the OTA market through the pandemic

They remarked that the number of smaller OTAs continues to increase, as indicated in their recent Google (NASDAQ: ) report. This fragmentation has been partially driven by larger OTAs such as Expedia and Booking (NASDAQ: ), who have embraced a B2B model. This model involves supplying rival OTAs like Hopper, eDreams (BME: ), and Trip.com (HK: ), thereby reducing the barrier to entry almost completely. Expedia's decision to terminate its partnership with Hopper might imply that they are reconsidering supplying rival OTAs and instead shifting their focus to truly incremental partnerships with airlines, banks, and other non-rival B2B entities. However, Hopper's confidence in replacing Expedia with other partners suggests that the B2B supply concept has gained traction and the ""cat is out of the bag,"" and alternative players can step in. This indicates that the trend towards fragmentation is unlikely to be fully reversed."

The tech giant released its own language model, known as LLaMA, to researchers and academics earlier this year, but the new version is said to be more widely available and customisable by companies.

According to Meta, its LLMs are ""open-source,"" which means that information about the new model will be made public.

The release of the new AI model is expected soon, the report said.

This is in contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose latest model GPT-4 is a so-called black box, meaning that the data and code used to build the model are not accessible to third parties.

“The competitive landscape of AI is going to completely change in the coming months, in the coming weeks maybe, when there will be open source platforms that are actually as good as the ones that are not,” Vice President and chief AI scientist at Meta, Yann LeCun, was quoted as saying.

Moreover, the report mentioned that Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives have hinted at a push towards creating multiple AI chatbots for individuals, advertisers and businesses across Meta platforms Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, powered by its LLMs.

Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk has launched a new AI company called xAI that aims to “understand the true nature of the universe”.

The team is headed up by Musk and includes team members that have worked at other big names in AI, including OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Research, and Google’s DeepMind.

""I'm excited for the opportunities presented right here in Korea,"" he added, reports Yonhap news agency.

When unveiling an upgraded version of Bard in May, Google said users can use the chatbot in Korean and Japanese along with English, before making Bard available in 40 more languages by the end of the year.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Korea and Japan are interesting regions with ""cutting-edge IT technology.""

Led by homegrown tech companies like Naver and Kakao, South Korea is one of the leading countries that are actively developing new technologies, including AI.

Naver, the country's top online service provider, is set to launch an upgraded version of its hyperscale AI platform, HyperCLOVA X, tailored for the Korean language, later this month.

Its rival Kakao also has plans to release its own AI chatbot in the second half.

""A lot of work can be achieved in partnership with the government, with other companies and with other developments,"" said Matias, the Google vice president. ""I think that the opportunity here is to partner together with the ministry and those in the ecosystem to interact.""

Google said it runs several research and development programs in collaboration with Korean companies, startups and researchers, like the Google for Startups programme, as part of its strategy to create an AI-friendly ecosystem in the country.

Earlier, Google joined hands with South Korea's NCSOFT Corp. to develop a new language model fit for the game developer's products.

""You can actually create value by having more companies, more entrepreneurs, more developers, more parties, to interact, find new ideas, learn from each other,"" he said. ""I hope that with this event, we're going to open more opportunities for collaboration, hopefully encourage and inspire more people to actually do the work in the space.""

For the parliamentary move to regulate AI development and products in South Korea, the Google official agreed it is necessary for AI to be overseen by the law.

""We are thinking that AI is something we need to consider in a very responsible way,"" he said. ""As our CEO said more than once, AI is too important not to regulate and too important not to regulate well.""

Once passkeys get enabled, they'll be able to upgrade eligible security keys to passkeys and register new passkeys.

""Passkeys build on the work of traditional security keys by adding easier configuration and enhanced recoverability, ensuring a private, and easy-to-use method to protect accounts while minimising the risk of account lockouts,"" Hirsch Singhal, Staff Product Manager at GitHub, said in a statement.

Unlike SMS and email, passkeys are unique per website, so they cannot be used to track a user's activities across different sites, according to the company.

""It will be immediately available to a small group of users in the US as we continue to refine the product and make it more helpful.""

The tech giant noted that due to the rapid growth of information, one of the biggest challenges is synthesising facts and ideas from multiple sources.

NotebookLM is an experimental product designed to use the power and promise of language models paired with the existing content to gain critical insights, faster.

""Think of it as a virtual research assistant that can summarise facts, explain complex ideas and brainstorm new connections,"" the company said.

A key difference between NotebookLM and traditional AI chatbots is that this app allows users to ""ground"" the language model in their notes and sources.

""Source-grounding effectively creates a personalised AI that's versed in the information relevant to you,"" Google explained.

Also, users will be able to ground NotebookLM in specific Google Docs that they choose.

In Google Docs, users will be able to do three things -- Get a summary, ask questions and generate ideas.

The top five games by downloads in H1 2022 were the same as the second half of 2022, with Subway Surfers and Free Fire leading the way.

Some new entrants included Block Blast Adventure Master from Hungry Studio and Attack Hole from Homa.

Another game on the rise in H1 was Gardenscapes, a match-3 title from Playrix.

The top mobile games by MAU were similar to H2 2022, led by Roblox, Free Fire and Candy Crush Saga.

The only new entrant to the top 10 was FIFA Soccer, which has maintained momentum built up during the FIFA World Cup in late 2022, the report said.

""CM3leon is the first multimodal model trained with a recipe adapted from text-only language models, including a large-scale retrieval-augmented pre-training stage and a second multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage,"" Meta said in a blogpost on Friday.

With CM3leon's capabilities, the company said that the image generation tools can produce more coherent imagery that better follows the input prompts.

According to Meta, CM3leon requires only five times the computing power and a smaller training dataset than previous transformer-based methods.

When compared to the most widely used image generation benchmark (zero-shot MS-COCO), CM3Leon achieved an FID (Frechet Inception Distance) score of 4.88, establishing a new state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation and outperforming Google (NASDAQ: )'s text-to-image model, Parti.

Moreover, the tech giant said that CM3leon excels at a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as visual question answering and long-form captioning.

CM3Leon's zero-shot performance compares favourably to larger models trained on larger datasets, despite training on a dataset of only three billion text tokens.

""With the goal of creating high-quality generative models, we believe CM3leon’s strong performance across a variety of tasks is a step toward higher-fidelity image generation and understanding,"" Meta said.

""Models like CM3leon could ultimately help boost creativity and better applications in the metaverse. We look forward to exploring the boundaries of multimodal language models and releasing more models in the future,"" it added.

2022-07-14, Investing.com,"Expedia kills Hopper deal, but analysts worry 'cat is out of the bag'",https://in.investing.com/news/expedia-kills-hopper-deal-but-analysts-worry-cat-is-out-of-the-bag-432SI-3723937,"Expedia (NASDAQ: ) has decided to end its partnership with rival online travel agency (OTA) Hopper, stemming from concerns about several practices they perceive as anti-consumer. The news was first reported by the website Skift on Wednesday.

""Expedia Group terminated its supply relationship with Hopper today,"" an Expedia Group spokesperson told Skift. ""The reasons for termination are simple: As Hopper’s product has evolved, we have determined that its features exploit consumer anxiety and confuse customers, leading them to purchase services they neither need nor fully understand. As leaders in powering the B2B travel market, we have a commitment to travelers and to our supply partners that we take very seriously, and, as such, we are ceasing placing our trusted supplier content on the Hopper platform.""

Commenting on that news, Bernstein analysts said the lack of a press release from Expedia shows this is ""likely immaterial to its own results"" however, ""it is illustrative of competitive pressures in the OTA industry today.""

While Expedia said the reason was that Hopper was exploiting customer anxiety, Hopper has suggested that the decision is more ""anti-competitive"". Clark thinks both are likely true.

The analysts have noted in the past that Hopper has been a key market share gainer in the OTA market through the pandemic

They remarked that the number of smaller OTAs continues to increase, as indicated in their recent Google (NASDAQ: ) report. This fragmentation has been partially driven by larger OTAs such as Expedia and Booking (NASDAQ: ), who have embraced a B2B model. This model involves supplying rival OTAs like Hopper, eDreams (BME: ), and Trip.com (HK: ), thereby reducing the barrier to entry almost completely. Expedia's decision to terminate its partnership with Hopper might imply that they are reconsidering supplying rival OTAs and instead shifting their focus to truly incremental partnerships with airlines, banks, and other non-rival B2B entities. However, Hopper's confidence in replacing Expedia with other partners suggests that the B2B supply concept has gained traction and the ""cat is out of the bag,"" and alternative players can step in. This indicates that the trend towards fragmentation is unlikely to be fully reversed."

The tech giant released its own language model, known as LLaMA, to researchers and academics earlier this year, but the new version is said to be more widely available and customisable by companies.

According to Meta, its LLMs are ""open-source,"" which means that information about the new model will be made public.

The release of the new AI model is expected soon, the report said.

This is in contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose latest model GPT-4 is a so-called black box, meaning that the data and code used to build the model are not accessible to third parties.

“The competitive landscape of AI is going to completely change in the coming months, in the coming weeks maybe, when there will be open source platforms that are actually as good as the ones that are not,” Vice President and chief AI scientist at Meta, Yann LeCun, was quoted as saying.

Moreover, the report mentioned that Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives have hinted at a push towards creating multiple AI chatbots for individuals, advertisers and businesses across Meta platforms Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook, powered by its LLMs.

Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk has launched a new AI company called xAI that aims to “understand the true nature of the universe”.

The team is headed up by Musk and includes team members that have worked at other big names in AI, including OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Research, and Google’s DeepMind.

""I'm excited for the opportunities presented right here in Korea,"" he added, reports Yonhap news agency.

When unveiling an upgraded version of Bard in May, Google said users can use the chatbot in Korean and Japanese along with English, before making Bard available in 40 more languages by the end of the year.

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Korea and Japan are interesting regions with ""cutting-edge IT technology.""

Led by homegrown tech companies like Naver and Kakao, South Korea is one of the leading countries that are actively developing new technologies, including AI.

Naver, the country's top online service provider, is set to launch an upgraded version of its hyperscale AI platform, HyperCLOVA X, tailored for the Korean language, later this month.

Its rival Kakao also has plans to release its own AI chatbot in the second half.

""A lot of work can be achieved in partnership with the government, with other companies and with other developments,"" said Matias, the Google vice president. ""I think that the opportunity here is to partner together with the ministry and those in the ecosystem to interact.""

Google said it runs several research and development programs in collaboration with Korean companies, startups and researchers, like the Google for Startups programme, as part of its strategy to create an AI-friendly ecosystem in the country.

Earlier, Google joined hands with South Korea's NCSOFT Corp. to develop a new language model fit for the game developer's products.

""You can actually create value by having more companies, more entrepreneurs, more developers, more parties, to interact, find new ideas, learn from each other,"" he said. ""I hope that with this event, we're going to open more opportunities for collaboration, hopefully encourage and inspire more people to actually do the work in the space.""

For the parliamentary move to regulate AI development and products in South Korea, the Google official agreed it is necessary for AI to be overseen by the law.

""We are thinking that AI is something we need to consider in a very responsible way,"" he said. ""As our CEO said more than once, AI is too important not to regulate and too important not to regulate well.""

Once passkeys get enabled, they'll be able to upgrade eligible security keys to passkeys and register new passkeys.

""Passkeys build on the work of traditional security keys by adding easier configuration and enhanced recoverability, ensuring a private, and easy-to-use method to protect accounts while minimising the risk of account lockouts,"" Hirsch Singhal, Staff Product Manager at GitHub, said in a statement.

Unlike SMS and email, passkeys are unique per website, so they cannot be used to track a user's activities across different sites, according to the company.

""It's our endeavour to reimagine what notetaking software might look like if you designed it from scratch knowing that you would have a powerful language model at its core: hence the LM,"" the company said in a blogpost on Wednesday.

""It will be immediately available to a small group of users in the US as we continue to refine the product and make it more helpful.""

The tech giant noted that due to the rapid growth of information, one of the biggest challenges is synthesising facts and ideas from multiple sources.

NotebookLM is an experimental product designed to use the power and promise of language models paired with the existing content to gain critical insights, faster.

""Think of it as a virtual research assistant that can summarise facts, explain complex ideas and brainstorm new connections,"" the company said.

A key difference between NotebookLM and traditional AI chatbots is that this app allows users to ""ground"" the language model in their notes and sources.

""Source-grounding effectively creates a personalised AI that's versed in the information relevant to you,"" Google explained.

Also, users will be able to ground NotebookLM in specific Google Docs that they choose.

In Google Docs, users will be able to do three things -- Get a summary, ask questions and generate ideas.

""The return to positive growth in H1 is an encouraging signal that the decline in mobile consumer spend during 2022 may have represented a temporary blip in the long-term sustained growth of the mobile app market,"" said the report.

Chinese short-video making app TikTok became the first app to surpass $1 billion in consumer spend in a quarter in Q1 2022, and also became the first app to surpass $2 billion, accumulating $2.1 billion in consumer spending in H1 2022.

Piccoma, Disney+ and YouTube saw growth versus H2 2022 of 34 per cent, 10 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively.

Unsurprisingly, the social media giants dominated the top download and monthly active user (MAU) charts in H1 2022. ByteDance (TikTok and CapCut) and Meta (Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook (NASDAQ: )) controlled the top five spots by downloads, while Meta continued its dominance of the MAU rankings, the report noted.

The top five games by downloads in H1 2022 were the same as the second half of 2022, with Subway Surfers and Free Fire leading the way.

Some new entrants included Block Blast Adventure Master from Hungry Studio and Attack Hole from Homa.

Another game on the rise in H1 was Gardenscapes, a match-3 title from Playrix.

The top mobile games by MAU were similar to H2 2022, led by Roblox, Free Fire and Candy Crush Saga.

The only new entrant to the top 10 was FIFA Soccer, which has maintained momentum built up during the FIFA World Cup in late 2022, the report said.

2022-07-12, Investing.com,Stock market today: Dow ends higher as big tech reigns supreme on easing inflation,https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-today-dow-ends-higher-as-big-tech-reigns-supreme-on-easing-inflation-3721421,"Investing.com -- The Dow gave up gains but ended higher Wednesday, as data showing inflation rose by the slowest pace in more than two years pushed Treasury yields lower and tech higher amid optimism that a widely expected rate increase later this month could prove to be the final hike.

The rose 0.25%, or 86 points, and the was up 1.2%, and the rose 0.74%.

Fed: One final hike in July?

The rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in May, with also slowing to a 3% pace from 4%, marking the slowest pace of price pressures since March 2021.

While many still expect the Fed to resume rate hikes later this month, rate hikes beyond July will likely be thrown into further doubt should upcoming economic data signal a further slowdown in inflation.

If economic data in the months ahead including the Employment Cost Index on July 28, and the employment and inflation data that is released in August, slow at the pace that we have seen in the CPI data of the past couple of months, then “the July hike may prove to be the final move of the cycle,” Jefferies said in a note.

Tech rallies as Treasury yields drop

Big tech shook off its recent malaise, led by Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) as Treasury yields fell sharply on bets that the Fed rate hikes are nearing an end.

Microsoft added more than 1% as the tech giant took another major step forward toward closing its $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ: ) after a Federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to delay the acquisition, citing a lack of evidence that the deal would lessen competition.

“With the injunction denied, Microsoft has a green light to close the deal before July 18,” Wedbush said in a note. Should the deal extend beyond July 18, then under the terms of the deal, Microsoft would have been on the hook to pay Activision $3B and be required to negotiate a new deal, Wedbush added.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, also closed higher, up more than 3.5% on reports that the chipmaker is in talks to be an anchor investor in ARM as the latter looks to move ahead with plans for an initial public offering that could happen in September, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.

PepsiCo and Delta set to get earnings season underway

PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ: ), which reports before the opening bell on Thursday is expected to deliver strong results, RBC says, driven by ongoing momentum in Frito Lay. “We think PEP will be able to raise EPS to cover current consensus,” RBC added, noting that annual EPS of $7.27 is below current consensus.

Vaishnavi Jayakumar, 36, who joined Meta in January 2020 after stints at Disney, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Twitter, said she was punished for asking how to move up the ranks at Meta, left out of opportunities, and layered under less experienced colleagues.

""I've never felt more keenly that as an Asian woman, I'm destined to be a worker, I'm not destined to be a leader,"" Jayakumar wrote in a recent LinkedIn post, adding that last month she faced ""a retaliatory termination at Meta disguised as a mass layoff"".

As the head of youth policy at Meta, Jayakumar was responsible for managing a team that provided guidance on age-appropriate policies and product features across all of Meta's apps.

""Everything went well for the first two years. I worked hard with my colleagues to improve the wellbeing of youth on Instagram and other Meta services, and received positive feedback,"" Jayakumar said in her long post.

However, after two years when she enquired about a path to promotion, she said she faced the familiar ""bamboo ceiling"" that Asian-Americans encounter.

According to Jayakumar, her manager suddenly began giving racially-coded negative feedback, claiming she wasn't senior enough for leadership, even though Jayakumar claimed she had more experience than other candidates.

Jayakumar's complaint referred to a 2022 study by Ascend, a network of Asian and Pacific Islander professionals, which said that 49 per cent of Meta's workforce is Asian but only 25 per cent of its executives are Asian.

Meta fired more than 11,000 employees at the end of 2022, followed by another 10,000 roles in another round of mass layoffs in March this year. Jayakumar's complaint is just one among the rising number of lawsuits filed by Asian Americans in the tech industry calling for action against long-standing racial prejudice in Silicon Valley.

According to USA Today, Jayakumar is demanding that Meta make policy changes, from tracking the rates of promotion for Asian Americans to training managers in tropes and stereotypes about Asian American employees.

Meta has so far declined to comment.

2022-07-12, IANS,"AI can address high cost, poor patient experience in healthcare: Report",https://in.investing.com/news/ai-can-address-high-cost-poor-patient-experience-in-healthcare-report-3720769,"New Delhi, July 12 (IANS) The implementation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in pharma and healthcare has the potential to address the issues of high costs and poor patient experiences while enhancing efficiency and patient outcomes, according to a report on Wednesday. With a growing focus on data-driven healthcare, generative AI is poised to significantly transform the industry, said the report by GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

“Generative AI is fundamentally revolutionising the healthcare scene, powering a transformative shift across the value chain. Its ability to customise multi-format content, serving everyone from pharmaceuticals to patients, bestows precisely targeted communication. However, adhering to responsible AI is pivotal in building trust and managing risks within the industry,” said Kiran Raj, Practice Head of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData, in a statement.

“Generative AI can streamline personalised care and guided diagnosis by synthesising key data points from patients' medical history, family history, and lifestyle. The technology can help physicians provide more effective care at lower costs, leading to better patient outcomes,” added Saurabh Daga, Associate Project Manager of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData.

GlobalData’s latest report provides a comprehensive view of how generative AI is being implemented across the pharma value chain for applications ranging from research and development, imaging and diagnostics to patient care and support.

Generative AI is set to revolutionise drug discovery by generating novel drug candidates based on researcher-provided criteria and constraints. Predicting the efficacy and safety of new drug candidates and personalising drug therapy are additional capabilities that are poised to improve patient outcomes.

While drug discovery startups such as Huma.AI, Insilico Medicine, and Absci are developing generative models capable of fast-tracking drug development, companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) through MedPalm 2 and BioNeMo Cloud are providing the necessary infrastructure for generative AI-powered drug discovery.

“While the generative AI landscape is not without risks, especially in regulated industries like pharma and healthcare, there is potential for significant advancements and benefits. Challenges such as bias, discrimination, and privacy need to be mitigated through governance,” Daga said.

“It is crucial to partner with organisations that offer industry perspective and technology expertise at the intersection of responsible AI to fully leverage the potential of recent technological breakthroughs,” he noted.

Bitcoin ETF filings directly impacted the Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) stock price.

In the world of the crypto market, the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has caught the attention of the crypto community. Recently, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that the Bitcoin ETF should be approved. While these things are going around, Cboe, the global market, has made a significant move that has added more pressure on the SEC.

JUST IN – All 5 of CBOEs spot #Bitcoin ETF applications have reached surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase.Now all eyes on the SEC — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) July 11, 2022

On June 11, all five Bitcoin ETF applications from the Cboe added a Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA) with the leading crypto exchange Coinbase. The Cboe updated the BTC ETF filings with the U.S. SEC from Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and the joint fund by ARK Invest. The updated filings clearly show that it has reached out to Coinbase to enter into the Surveillance Sharing Agreement.

In the earlier filings, Cboe mentioned that it was expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase. However, the agreement was settled on June 21 for each filing. On Tuesday, they showed the updated original filings with the U.S. SEC.

Coinbase’s Stock Price Surges After Bitcoin ETF Filings

The Surveillance Sharing Agreement, which is referred to as SSA, has become the most important part of Bitcoin ETF applications after the SEC comments. The U.S. SEC has stated that these agreements are necessary to prevent market manipulation.

The Spot Bitcoin ETF has made headlines in the crypto market over the past few days. Recently, the SEC rejected the Bitcoin filings, saying that the filings were not sufficiently clear and comprehensive. After the SEC comments, every firm has started refiling the BTC ETF with the SEC. As the whole crypto market is waiting for the SEC’s approval, Cboe filings have added more pressure on the SEC to approve the BTC ETF requests.

The updated Bitcoin ETF filings directly impacted the Coinbase stock price, which went up. After the recent Cboe BTC ETF filing, the price rose significantly. The Coinbase share price experienced an impressive surge of over 10% on Tuesday. Moreover, it has reached its highest price since August 16, according to Google (NASDAQ: ) Finance."

The company was working on 'Bubble Characters' app, however it recently “deprioritised” those plans amid an internal reorganisation, according to materials seen by CNBC.

When a product gets deprioritised at Google, the development work on it ceases.

According to internal documentation, the Bubble Characters app featured ""a choice of a talking digital character that would interact in conversations with Gen Z users,"" the report said.

The tech giant had been working on this app since quarter four (Q4) of 2021.

The app’s description mentioned that it featured “human-like” conversations that “take action” and are “interesting for GenZ.”

Large language models—massive data sets used to understand and produce human-like text—powered the conversations.

“What started out as something from a science fiction novel, became the next generation of human-level conversation,” the app’s description read.

""Within the Assistant organisation, which works on virtual assistant applications or two-way conversations for a variety of platforms, executives have prioritised ChatGPT-competitor Bard amid an internal reorganisation that included the departure of a few key executives,"" the report said.

The class-action suit was filed on Tuesday against Google, its parent company Alphabet, and AI subsidiary DeepMind in a federal court in Californiaand was brought by Clarkson Law Firm.

The firm previously filed a similar suit against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI last month. (OpenAI did not previously respond to a request for comment on the suit.)

According to the lawsuit, Google ""has been secretly stealing everything ever created and shared on the Internet by hundreds of millions of Americans"".

The complaint also alleged that Google took ""virtually the entirety of our digital footprint"", including ""creative and copy-written works"" to build its AI products.

Google did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

Last week, Google updated its privacy policy in which it stated that it can use publicly available data to help train its AI models.

The tech giant changed the wording of its policy over the weekend and switched ""AI models"" for ""language models"".

With the new policy, Google is informing people that anything they publicly post online can be used to train Bard, future versions and other generative AI products it develops.

Critics have expressed concerns about companies' use of publicly available information to train large language models for generative AI use.

Last month, the Sam Altman-run OpenAI was sued in a class-action lawsuit in the US for allegedly stealing data from the public to train its AI chatbot ChatGPT.

2022-07-11, Investing.com,Nasdaq 100 rebalance will benefit these 7 stocks - Wells Fargo,https://in.investing.com/news/nasdaq-100-rebalance-will-benefit-these-7-stocks--wells-fargo-432SI-3719242,"Wells Fargo analysts reflected on the upcoming Special Rebalance that is taking place on Friday, July 21.

A Special Rebalance is usually conducted to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights. This particular move is focused on reducing concentration risk and reducing the dominance of the Big Seven, namely Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

“With uber-caps overbought, near-term liquidity demands will likely weigh on the group. In 2011, down-sized names lagged by 2-3% between announcement and event,” analysts said in a client note.

While these seven stocks will be down-sizers, Wells Fargo analysts expect the following stocks to benefit from the upcoming rebalancing: Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ), Booking.com (NASDAQ: ), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: ), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ), Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ), and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ).

Back to the down-sizers, analysts expect Microsoft’s weight to fall by 1.8%, while Apple should lose 1.7%. Nvidia, Amazon, and Google are expected to lose around 1%.

“We believe this liquidity event dents—but does not break—the longer-term uber-cap trend. In our view, similar to 2000, an aggressive Fed that pushes the US into recession is what ultimately undoes the uber-cap and “new economy” trades. As long as the economy remains in a malaise (i.e., not a recession), rather optimistic valuation premiums and growth estimates are difficult to refute,” analysts concluded."

Wells Fargo analysts said news on Monday that the EU approved a new transatlantic data transfer agreement ""removes a key regulatory risk"" for the company in the 2nd-half of the year.

""The agreement, which will take effect immediately, ends the legal limbo for tech companies such as Meta and Google (NASDAQ: ) after two previous accords that established the legality of transatlantic data transfers were struck down in '15 and '20 by EU's top court due to concerns around US surveillance practices and privacy issues,"" the analysts commented.

Following the implementation of the new framework, Meta can now uphold the existing transatlantic data transfer practices without any disruptions, the analysts explain. This development eliminates a significant regulatory risk for the company in the second half of the year. To provide context, in May 2022, the Irish Data Protection Commission fined Meta €1.2 billion (€1 = $1.1004) due to GDPR violations and mandated the cessation of Facebook's EU user data transfer to the US. Had the new agreement not been in place, Meta would have been obligated to adhere to this order by mid-October.

Despite the temporary relief offered by the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework, there are potential court challenges ahead, the analysts add. Lawyer Max Schrems, known for previous successful legal battles against similar agreements, intends to challenge the new deal in court by late August. Therefore, the firm maintains a cautious stance regarding the regulatory landscape in the medium to long term.

The firm maintained its Equal Weight rating and $313 price target on Meta."

2022-07-10, Investing.com,5 internet stocks to own ahead of Q2 earnings season - Wolfe Research,https://in.investing.com/news/5-internet-stocks-to-own-ahead-of-q2-earnings-season--wolfe-research-432SI-3717619,"Ahead of the Q2 earnings season that is officially due to start later this week, Wolfe Research analysts highlighted 5 tech stocks that should find a way into your portfolio.

For Q2 2022, the estimated earnings decline for the is -7.2%, which would mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020.

The focus of Wolfe’s analysts is on the Online Ads and eCommerce sector. Along these lines, the analysts highlight the following 5 stocks:

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) – Wolfe Research has an ""Outperform"" rating and a $150 per share price target on META shares. The analysts have “reasonable confidence” that Meta will deliver positive estimate revision in the second half of 2022. “META should report solid 2Q results with revenues coming at or near the high-end of the prior guidance range ($32B). Our checks with digital advertising agencies intra-quarter indicated strong trends in April, May, and early June driven by growth in ad budgets, improving ROIs, and incremental adoption of Advantage+ across a wider range of advertiser cohorts,” they said. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – The analysts hiked the price target on the ""Outperform""-rated Amazon stock by $10 to $150 per share. They see the upside potential for Amazon in the context of Q2 EBIT numbers. “We expect 2Q to be a healthy print for AMZN. We see a path for retail margins, specifically in North America, to expand steadily over the next few quarters. However, it likely takes a few more quarters until retail EBIT margin reaches pre-COVID levels,” they said. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) – Google shares also received a boost at Wolfe with the price target being raised to $140 per share. Still, Wolfe Research analysts seem less bullish on GOOGL than on META and AMZN. “We don’t see meaningful risks to GOOGL’s search revenue growth trajectory in the near-term. However, 2H margin risks (from potential ramp in hiring and other costs including NFL YT content deal) keep our excitement on GOOGL shares tempered NT.” Pinterest (NYSE: ) – The analysts are looking for signs of improving growth rates. They reiterated an ""Outperform"" rating on PINS and a $33 per share price target, while the stock remains “one of our top picks for 2H.” “We think the company is making steady progress on several long-term initiatives, the effect of which is somewhat masked by the impact of deceleration in discretionary consumer spending during 1Q.” MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) – The company is likely to report “strong top-line growth in commerce and fintech businesses in several key markets,” the analysts predict. Like PINS, MELI is also one of Wolfe’s Top Picks for 2H23. The new price target on MELI stock is $1400 per share, down from the prior $1700.

The stock with the largest upside potential in Wolfe’s research coverage of Online Ads and eCommerce companies is Pinterest (20%+)."
2022-07-10, IANS,Google Messages may soon get 'animated emoji' feature,https://in.investing.com/news/google-messages-may-soon-get-animated-emoji-feature-3717410,"San Francisco, July 10 (IANS) Google (NASDAQ: ) is reportedly testing an 'animated emoji' feature in the instant messaging application 'Google Messages'.It seems like animations only work when sending one emoji, reports Android Police.

So sending more than one emoji or even a combination of text and emoji will not trigger the animation.

This feature was first spotted by Reddit user BruthaBeige.

Also, Android expert Mishaal Rahman received a tip on the feature, with a user in the replies later revealing its existence.

""However, the feature doesn't seem to be live for everyone, so it's likely a region-restricted rollout at the moment,"" the report said.

In March this year, the tech giant was reportedly working on a redesigned voice recorder user interface (UI) for its instant messaging application.

Meanwhile, in January, it was reported that the company would bring a new feature to Google Messages which would allow users to create their own user profile.

""Additionally, the formatting toolbar will be more visible, you will see an I-beam cursor, and tapping once exposes an on-screen keyboard unless a physical keyboard is attached.""

Also, the tech giant announced an option to insert a link and press the tab key to convert the link into a smart chip in Google Sheets.

Users can access this feature when they copy and paste email addresses or links to Drive files, Maps places or Youtube videos into a Sheet.

Meanwhile, last month, Google had announced that it was making 'paginated mode' default on Docs for Android.

This sets up the Google Doc with pages and page breaks in the app, enabling a more cohesive visual design between the web and mobile.

Fed: One final hike in July?

The rose 0.2% last month after edging up 0.1% in May, with also slowing to a 3% pace from 4%, marking the slowest pace of price pressures since March 2021.

While many still expect the Fed to resume rate hikes later this month, rate hikes beyond July will likely be thrown into further doubt should upcoming economic data signal a further slowdown in inflation.

If economic data in the months ahead including the Employment Cost Index on July 28, and the employment and inflation data that is released in August, slow at the pace that we have seen in the CPI data of the past couple of months, then “the July hike may prove to be the final move of the cycle,” Jefferies said in a note.

Tech rallies as Treasury yields drop

Big tech shook off its recent malaise, led by Google (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ) as Treasury yields fell sharply on bets that the Fed rate hikes are nearing an end.

Microsoft added more than 1% as the tech giant took another major step forward toward closing its $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard Inc (NASDAQ: ) after a Federal judge rejected the Federal Trade Commission’s request to delay the acquisition, citing a lack of evidence that the deal would lessen competition.

“With the injunction denied, Microsoft has a green light to close the deal before July 18,” Wedbush said in a note. Should the deal extend beyond July 18, then under the terms of the deal, Microsoft would have been on the hook to pay Activision $3B and be required to negotiate a new deal, Wedbush added.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, also closed higher, up more than 3.5% on reports that the chipmaker is in talks to be an anchor investor in ARM as the latter looks to move ahead with plans for an initial public offering that could happen in September, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources.

Vaishnavi Jayakumar, 36, who joined Meta in January 2020 after stints at Disney, Google (NASDAQ: ) and Twitter, said she was punished for asking how to move up the ranks at Meta, left out of opportunities, and layered under less experienced colleagues.

""I've never felt more keenly that as an Asian woman, I'm destined to be a worker, I'm not destined to be a leader,"" Jayakumar wrote in a recent LinkedIn post, adding that last month she faced ""a retaliatory termination at Meta disguised as a mass layoff"".

As the head of youth policy at Meta, Jayakumar was responsible for managing a team that provided guidance on age-appropriate policies and product features across all of Meta's apps.

""Everything went well for the first two years. I worked hard with my colleagues to improve the wellbeing of youth on Instagram and other Meta services, and received positive feedback,"" Jayakumar said in her long post.

However, after two years when she enquired about a path to promotion, she said she faced the familiar ""bamboo ceiling"" that Asian-Americans encounter.

According to Jayakumar, her manager suddenly began giving racially-coded negative feedback, claiming she wasn't senior enough for leadership, even though Jayakumar claimed she had more experience than other candidates.

Jayakumar's complaint referred to a 2022 study by Ascend, a network of Asian and Pacific Islander professionals, which said that 49 per cent of Meta's workforce is Asian but only 25 per cent of its executives are Asian.

Meta fired more than 11,000 employees at the end of 2022, followed by another 10,000 roles in another round of mass layoffs in March this year. Jayakumar's complaint is just one among the rising number of lawsuits filed by Asian Americans in the tech industry calling for action against long-standing racial prejudice in Silicon Valley.

According to USA Today, Jayakumar is demanding that Meta make policy changes, from tracking the rates of promotion for Asian Americans to training managers in tropes and stereotypes about Asian American employees.

Meta has so far declined to comment.

With a growing focus on data-driven healthcare, generative AI is poised to significantly transform the industry, said the report by GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

“Generative AI is fundamentally revolutionising the healthcare scene, powering a transformative shift across the value chain. Its ability to customise multi-format content, serving everyone from pharmaceuticals to patients, bestows precisely targeted communication. However, adhering to responsible AI is pivotal in building trust and managing risks within the industry,” said Kiran Raj, Practice Head of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData, in a statement.

“Generative AI can streamline personalised care and guided diagnosis by synthesising key data points from patients' medical history, family history, and lifestyle. The technology can help physicians provide more effective care at lower costs, leading to better patient outcomes,” added Saurabh Daga, Associate Project Manager of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData.

GlobalData’s latest report provides a comprehensive view of how generative AI is being implemented across the pharma value chain for applications ranging from research and development, imaging and diagnostics to patient care and support.

Generative AI is set to revolutionise drug discovery by generating novel drug candidates based on researcher-provided criteria and constraints. Predicting the efficacy and safety of new drug candidates and personalising drug therapy are additional capabilities that are poised to improve patient outcomes.

While drug discovery startups such as Huma.AI, Insilico Medicine, and Absci are developing generative models capable of fast-tracking drug development, companies like Google (NASDAQ: ) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) through MedPalm 2 and BioNeMo Cloud are providing the necessary infrastructure for generative AI-powered drug discovery.

“While the generative AI landscape is not without risks, especially in regulated industries like pharma and healthcare, there is potential for significant advancements and benefits. Challenges such as bias, discrimination, and privacy need to be mitigated through governance,” Daga said.

“It is crucial to partner with organisations that offer industry perspective and technology expertise at the intersection of responsible AI to fully leverage the potential of recent technological breakthroughs,” he noted.

In the world of the crypto market, the Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has caught the attention of the crypto community. Recently, the former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stated that the Bitcoin ETF should be approved. While these things are going around, Cboe, the global market, has made a significant move that has added more pressure on the SEC.

On June 11, all five Bitcoin ETF applications from the Cboe added a Surveillance Sharing Agreement (SSA) with the leading crypto exchange Coinbase. The Cboe updated the BTC ETF filings with the U.S. SEC from Invesco, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, and the joint fund by ARK Invest. The updated filings clearly show that it has reached out to Coinbase to enter into the Surveillance Sharing Agreement.

In the earlier filings, Cboe mentioned that it was expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase. However, the agreement was settled on June 21 for each filing. On Tuesday, they showed the updated original filings with the U.S. SEC.

Coinbase’s Stock Price Surges After Bitcoin ETF Filings

The company was working on 'Bubble Characters' app, however it recently “deprioritised” those plans amid an internal reorganisation, according to materials seen by CNBC.

When a product gets deprioritised at Google, the development work on it ceases.

According to internal documentation, the Bubble Characters app featured ""a choice of a talking digital character that would interact in conversations with Gen Z users,"" the report said.

The tech giant had been working on this app since quarter four (Q4) of 2021.

The app’s description mentioned that it featured “human-like” conversations that “take action” and are “interesting for GenZ.”

Large language models—massive data sets used to understand and produce human-like text—powered the conversations.

“What started out as something from a science fiction novel, became the next generation of human-level conversation,” the app’s description read.

The class-action suit was filed on Tuesday against Google, its parent company Alphabet, and AI subsidiary DeepMind in a federal court in Californiaand was brought by Clarkson Law Firm.

The firm previously filed a similar suit against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI last month. (OpenAI did not previously respond to a request for comment on the suit.)

According to the lawsuit, Google ""has been secretly stealing everything ever created and shared on the Internet by hundreds of millions of Americans"".

The complaint also alleged that Google took ""virtually the entirety of our digital footprint"", including ""creative and copy-written works"" to build its AI products.

Google did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.

Last week, Google updated its privacy policy in which it stated that it can use publicly available data to help train its AI models.

The tech giant changed the wording of its policy over the weekend and switched ""AI models"" for ""language models"".

With the new policy, Google is informing people that anything they publicly post online can be used to train Bard, future versions and other generative AI products it develops.

Critics have expressed concerns about companies' use of publicly available information to train large language models for generative AI use.

A Special Rebalance is usually conducted to address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights. This particular move is focused on reducing concentration risk and reducing the dominance of the Big Seven, namely Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ).

“With uber-caps overbought, near-term liquidity demands will likely weigh on the group. In 2011, down-sized names lagged by 2-3% between announcement and event,” analysts said in a client note.

While these seven stocks will be down-sizers, Wells Fargo analysts expect the following stocks to benefit from the upcoming rebalancing: Starbucks (NASDAQ: ), Mondelez (NASDAQ: ), Booking.com (NASDAQ: ), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: ), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ), Analog Devices (NASDAQ: ), and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ).

Back to the down-sizers, analysts expect Microsoft’s weight to fall by 1.8%, while Apple should lose 1.7%. Nvidia, Amazon, and Google are expected to lose around 1%.

“We believe this liquidity event dents—but does not break—the longer-term uber-cap trend. In our view, similar to 2000, an aggressive Fed that pushes the US into recession is what ultimately undoes the uber-cap and “new economy” trades. As long as the economy remains in a malaise (i.e., not a recession), rather optimistic valuation premiums and growth estimates are difficult to refute,” analysts concluded."
2022-07-11, Investing.com,Meta on a win streak as new transatlantic data transfer deal removes 'key risk',https://in.investing.com/news/meta-on-a-win-streak-as-new-transatlantic-data-transfer-deal-removes-key-risk-432SI-3718938,"In addition to its new ""Twitter Killer"" Threads app, analysts are pointing to another recent ""win"" for Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ). Wells Fargo analysts said news on Monday that the EU approved a new transatlantic data transfer agreement ""removes a key regulatory risk"" for the company in the 2nd-half of the year.

""The agreement, which will take effect immediately, ends the legal limbo for tech companies such as Meta and Google (NASDAQ: ) after two previous accords that established the legality of transatlantic data transfers were struck down in '15 and '20 by EU's top court due to concerns around US surveillance practices and privacy issues,"" the analysts commented.

Following the implementation of the new framework, Meta can now uphold the existing transatlantic data transfer practices without any disruptions, the analysts explain. This development eliminates a significant regulatory risk for the company in the second half of the year. To provide context, in May 2022, the Irish Data Protection Commission fined Meta €1.2 billion (€1 = $1.1004) due to GDPR violations and mandated the cessation of Facebook's EU user data transfer to the US. Had the new agreement not been in place, Meta would have been obligated to adhere to this order by mid-October.

Despite the temporary relief offered by the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework, there are potential court challenges ahead, the analysts add. Lawyer Max Schrems, known for previous successful legal battles against similar agreements, intends to challenge the new deal in court by late August. Therefore, the firm maintains a cautious stance regarding the regulatory landscape in the medium to long term.

The firm maintained its Equal Weight rating and $313 price target on Meta."

For Q2 2022, the estimated earnings decline for the is -7.2%, which would mark the largest earnings decline reported by the index since Q2 2020.

The focus of Wolfe’s analysts is on the Online Ads and eCommerce sector. Along these lines, the analysts highlight the following 5 stocks:

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) – Wolfe Research has an ""Outperform"" rating and a $150 per share price target on META shares. The analysts have “reasonable confidence” that Meta will deliver positive estimate revision in the second half of 2022. “META should report solid 2Q results with revenues coming at or near the high-end of the prior guidance range ($32B). Our checks with digital advertising agencies intra-quarter indicated strong trends in April, May, and early June driven by growth in ad budgets, improving ROIs, and incremental adoption of Advantage+ across a wider range of advertiser cohorts,” they said. Amazon (NASDAQ: ) – The analysts hiked the price target on the ""Outperform""-rated Amazon stock by $10 to $150 per share. They see the upside potential for Amazon in the context of Q2 EBIT numbers. “We expect 2Q to be a healthy print for AMZN. We see a path for retail margins, specifically in North America, to expand steadily over the next few quarters. However, it likely takes a few more quarters until retail EBIT margin reaches pre-COVID levels,” they said. Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) – Google shares also received a boost at Wolfe with the price target being raised to $140 per share. Still, Wolfe Research analysts seem less bullish on GOOGL than on META and AMZN. “We don’t see meaningful risks to GOOGL’s search revenue growth trajectory in the near-term. However, 2H margin risks (from potential ramp in hiring and other costs including NFL YT content deal) keep our excitement on GOOGL shares tempered NT.” Pinterest (NYSE: ) – The analysts are looking for signs of improving growth rates. They reiterated an ""Outperform"" rating on PINS and a $33 per share price target, while the stock remains “one of our top picks for 2H.” “We think the company is making steady progress on several long-term initiatives, the effect of which is somewhat masked by the impact of deceleration in discretionary consumer spending during 1Q.” MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: ) – The company is likely to report “strong top-line growth in commerce and fintech businesses in several key markets,” the analysts predict. Like PINS, MELI is also one of Wolfe’s Top Picks for 2H23. The new price target on MELI stock is $1400 per share, down from the prior $1700.

The stock with the largest upside potential in Wolfe’s research coverage of Online Ads and eCommerce companies is Pinterest (20%+)."

2022-07-09, IANS,Unsupervised Vit-D use over a long time leads to complications: Expert,https://in.investing.com/news/unsupervised-vitd-use-over-a-long-time-leads-to-complications-expert-3716234,"Hyderabad, July 9 (IANS) Vitamin D deficiency is not a major risk factor for heart attacks or atrial fibrillation. It is a soft target and not a hard point in management of heart disease, opines leading cardiologist Dr C. Raghu.According to him, the major risk factors for heart attacks remain hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol and family history

In an interview with IANS, the senior interventional cardiologist and clinical director at Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, explained some of the recent advances in the domain of heart heath.

Q: How do you look at the recent study that Vitamin D might reduce the risk of heart attacks and prevent irregular heartbeats?

A: These are not therapies for these problems. These are in addition to what all other measures a person takes. People might think that Vitamin D is the only thing. Heart disease is a multi-factor disorder.

Still, the standard risk factors remain diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and family. These have strong correlation. Vitamin D to treat or to prevent heart attack is still a long term goal even going by this study.

Many studies might come on various factors and they might choose positive benefits but for these positive benefits to translate to clinical medicine is a long process.

There are many medications which can definitely reduce the heart event rate but for this many factors have to be addressed properly.

Vitamin D is a very soft target not a hard point. It is not the only thing. People should not think that if I take Vitamin D, I will be okay. I think fundamentals remain the same.

Diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and physical activity continue to remain major pillars. These risk factors have to be addressed to prevent heart attack.

Q: How common is atrial fibrillation in the Indian context?

A: Atrial fibrillation is worsening like heart disease. It is a multifactorial disease. Most of the patients of atrial fibrillation are elderly women they have underlying hypertension, diabetes and they have stiff heart syndrome. In this group of patients prone to develop atrial fibrillation there are many hard end points which we can address rather than focusing on Vitamin D.

Vitamin D is not a major risk factor. In the Indian context also, atrial fibrillation is an emerging epidemic.

The main reasons are still uncontrolled high blood pressure, aging process and stiff heart. These will continue to be the main promoters of development atrial fibrillation. As a doctor, I would prefer to treat them rather than treat a very soft end point like Vitamin D.

Q: Will the use of higher doses of Vitamin D for a longer period negatively impact patients? If yes, what are the risks?

A: Yes. That is one of the major reasons why one should be very careful. Somebody might think what is the harm in consuming Vitamin D as it is a simple medication but that's not the way. Unsupervised Vitamin D use for a prolonged period of time can lead to lot of medical complications.

Some people might develop renal dysfunction, some people might develop hyperparathyroidism or produce more calcium (hypercalcemia). There are a lot of metabolic problems that may happen if somebody takes long duration vitamin D without proper medical supervision.

Presence of deficiency of Vitamin D and its correction are not the same. Sometimes correction of vitamin D deficiency might not reduce the primary problem. Prolonged consumption of Vitamin D and unsupervised especially elderly people tend to develop more complications.

One should be cautious in taking Vitamin D without supervision. Having said that, there are a lot of natural sources for production of Vitamin D. I would prefer my patients to have a natural way to produce Vitamin D by their body as a medication.

I encourage my patients to have 15 minutes of sunlight at least 2-3 times a week and at least once a week, do traditional remedies like application of castor oil to promote internal development of Vitamin D. These are simple measures one can take and naturally produce Vitamin much more quantitatively better.

Q-What are the other new or recent discoveries for managing heart health?

In the management of heart health, what the recent advances suggest is to stick to the traditional risk factors only. We now have a lot of objective data.

Let us consider Lipid. We have a lot of data which emerged in the last one decade indicating that people should target their Lipid. There is a lot of misinformation and misconception which are being propelled by various sources indicating that one should not believe in Lipid but we have strong data on the management of Lipid.

We have clear-cut numbers. What is LDL cholesterol a person should have. The numbers are different for a person who does not have heart attack and the one who had heart attack.

For a person who does not have a heart attack but has only Diabetes, we aim for LDL of less than 70. Same for a person with heart attack we aim for LDL cholesterol of less than 55. Same for a person who has got a high risk we aim for less than 35.

Previously we never used to aim for such low levels of LDL cholesterol. Now we understand that a very low level of LDL cholesterol will reduce the risk of having a cardiac event. This is one of the important advances which I think people have to be aware of.

There are different cut-off levels. When people go to a laboratory, the normal value of cholesterol creates confusion.

They will try to remain at a much higher level than what is desired for them. A lot of personalised medicine is coming for different subsections of people. It might look very less interesting for people but it is a very important and also inexpensive way to reduce the risk of heart attack.

One of the common ways to reduce heart attacks is to use aspirin. We all think that taking aspirin a day reduces the risk. Now with the availability of new data, we can understand that certain groups of patients get benefited and certain groups of patients can get harmed.

What we understand is that aspirin used for patients less than 60 who have diabetes and hypertension, they get better whereas for patients who are more than 60 years, we have to select patients who are going to be benefited rather than using aspirin for all of them as a blanket.

Aspirin therapy is very useful for prevention of heart stroke in people who already had a heart attack but for those people who never had a heart attack in the past or who never had bypass surgery, it is better to limit the use of aspirin among people who are less than 60.

So we have to differentiate between those who had heart attack angioplasty vis-a-vis those who never had an event and use aspirin selectively for people who already had heart attack and for those who did not have heart attack, we need to calculate the risk and then only use benefit of the therapy.

We now understand that women tend to have a higher risk of heart attack than what we were thinking in the past. Now a days, we see a lot of women also developing heart attacks. That is due to multiple to new risk factors which we were hitherto not knowing.

These risk are enhancers: for women who tend to premature menopause naturally or surgically, they will have a higher risk of heart attack. Premature means less than 40.

Women who have immunological disorders like Rheumatoid arthritis or SLE tend to have higher chances of heart attack. Such women possibly take aspirin to prevent heart attack.

In addition to traditional risk factors, we have risk enhancing factors for women and people who have South Asian ancestry like Indians. They play an important role for the development of heart attacks.

South Asian ancestry people tend to have higher risk of heart attack especially those with a family history of heart attacks in less than 50 years of age. Those people are at higher risk of developing heart attacks. That is also considered a risk enhancer.

That's why you see a lot of young people developing heart attacks among the Indian population because of our propensity. It is not considered as risk factor but considered risk enhancer

Compared to the past we are seeing more and more women developing heart attacks at younger age. Previously we were not seeing this. Women who tend to have higher blood pressure during pregnancy may develop heart attacks. This is also considered a risk enhancer for a heart attack.

Q: Is building more data helping understand the risk factors and risk enhances better?

A: We continue to get data. The larger the data set, better we can understand the association.

Risk scores have also been developed. These risk scores help us to estimate what is the risk of a particular person to a heart attack in the next 10 years. With these risk scores, objective risk assessment is possible compared to what we used to assess risk in a subjective way.

For the Indian population who are having a risk of more than 10 per cent, it is considered high risk in India. This means more than 10 per cent chance of having a heart attack in the next 10 years is considered high risk in India.

Indian race and south Asian ancestry itself is a risk enhancer. If risk calculation is more than 10 per cent, it is considered high risk whereas the same for any other race, we consider high risk if it is more than 20 per cent. The bar is set at the lower level for the Indian population.

Clinical practitioners and even lay persons calculate risk score. Easiest risk score they use is by the American Heart Association. This risk score calculator is developed in the form of an app and available on Google (NASDAQ: ) as well as Apple (NASDAQ: ) store. It is an ASCVD risk calculator. This is an objective app. A person can calculate the risk.

Risk score gives an idea what medication one should take. For example whether a person should take aspirin, cholesterol lowering medication, blood pressure medication, and what lifestyle modification is required. One can also know how much risk reduction is possible by adhering to those lifestyle modifications.

Indians calculating risk on ASCVD need to choose an 'other' group which happens to be of South Asian ancestry. More than 20 per cent risk score is considered high risk in the American context while for Indian people, more than 10 per cent risk is considered high risk.

2022-07-07, Investing.com,Top 7 companies buying back the most stock,https://in.investing.com/news/top-7-companies-buying-back-the-most-stock-432SI-3715283,"As the Q2 earnings season is set to start, investors will also get a glimpse into how corporate share repurchase plans are progressing. While stock buybacks are sometimes viewed as controversial, the greatest investor of all time – Warren Buffett – is a big proponent of them.

""The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up,"" Buffett said about share repurchases in his 2022 annual letter to shareholders. ""Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices."" He went on to say that those that criticize share repurchases are ""either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue.""

Below we highlight the top seven S&P 500 companies that bought back the most stock in Q1 and are working off massive share repurchase plans in the current quarter:

Apple (NASDAQ: ) bought back $20.012 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $21.791 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $22.961 billion in Q1 2022. In May of 2022, the board of directors of Apple authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) bought back $14.557 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $15.407 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $13.3 billion in Q1 2022. In April of 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) bought back $10.374 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $7.52 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $10.431 billion in Q1 2022. In February of 2022, Meta announced a $40 billion increase in their share repurchase authorization.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) bought back $5.509 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $5.459 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $8.822 billion in Q1 2022. In September of 2021, the Board of Directors of Microsoft approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases. As of March 31, 2022, $26.9 billion remained of this $60.0 billion share repurchase program.

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) bought back $4.806 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $2.461 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $172 million in Q1 2022. As of April 21, 2022, T-Mobile US has a remaining authorization of up to $5.5 billion through the end of September 2022.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) (NYSE: ) bought back $4.45 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $2.608 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $3.180 billion in Q1 2022. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman of the Board and chief executive officer, and Charlie Munger, vice chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) bought back $4.34 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $4.675 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $2.067 billion in Q1 2022. In December of 2022, Exxon Mobil announced an expansion of its $30 billion share-repurchase program, which is now up to $50 billion through 2024."
2022-07-07, IANS,"Reservations followed Indians to US, now they may get reprieve (IANS Column: Out of Turn)",https://in.investing.com/news/reservations-followed-indians-to-us-now-they-may-get-reprieve-ians-column-out-of-turn-3714602,"New York, July 7 (IANS) Some Indian immigrants to the US used to say that a reason for coming here was the reservations policy in university admissions and jobs in their homeland and they wanted their children to escape its clutches. But it followed them here in the form of affirmative action in universities and government programmes and threatened to spill over into technology and science jobs.The US Supreme Court’s ruling last week in cases involving Harvard and the Univerity of North Carolina that race-based affirmative action programmes violated the Constitution’s provisions on equality of all may give them a reprieve, but risks persist.

The cases were brought by an organisation called Students for Fair Admissions (SFA) primarily on behalf of Asian students with high academic credentials denied admission because of the affirmative action programmes.

Three Indian and two Hindu organisations joined other Asian organisations in filing a brief before the Supreme Court supporting the case because Indians are a part of the Asian demographic.

Explicit racial quotas -- similar to the reservations in India -- were always illegal in the US and the affirmative action programmes skirted it by using other strategies like awarding almost uniformly low scores for personality factors like “likeability” and being “respected” to Asian students to bring down their rating for admissions, while boosting admissions of others.

Universities justified their action claiming that they wanted a student body more representative of the general population. The Asian groups’ court brief pointed out that admissions counsellors and guides advised Asian students “to hide their identity, to emphasize personal characteristics that avoid Asian stereotypes”.

Vijay Chokalingam, the brother of Hollywood actress and producer Mindy Kaling, exposed how it works.

Challenged by mediocre scores on the medical school entrance test, he modified his name to “JoJo Ingam” and altered his appearance on the photograph with the application in a way to be mistaken for an African-American and found a coveted seat.

The Asian brief said, “in the hierarchy of race, Asian American applicants rank lowest at Harvard”.

But if the Indian hierarchy of castes for reservations were to be applied to the US affirmative programmes, Asians would be considered the “highest”, the Whites as something similar to backward castes and African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans as the equivalent of scheduled castes.

The affirmative action programmes that sought in effect to limit admissions of Asians also benefitted Whites. And here’s why:

Although most of the rhetoric was about White privilege needing a correctie, in reality, Asian students had to score 140 points more than White students in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) for admission to elite universities, according to a study by two Princeton University scholars.

SAT, along with another known as ACT, was used to help determine the academic capacbitiies of undergraduate applicants.

The apparent rationale for limiting Asian admissions by Harvard, but not openly admitted, was that they are over-represented:

They are 6.3 per cent of the US population, but make up 27.9 per cent of students admitted to Harvard College, the university’s undergraduate division.

While some supporters view affirmative action as a form of reparation for the history of slavery of African-Americans, and discrimination against them, Latinos and Native Americans, those responsible for it were some Whites.

But Asians were being made to pay the price for it. And that despite Asians also having been discriminated against: In fact, Indians had faced the discrimination of being excluded from immigration under a 1917 legislation till 1964 and those already here were not allowed to own land in California under a 1913 legislation.

Raj Razdan, president of The National Federation of Indian American Associations (NFIA), which was one of the groups that joined in filing the Supreme Court brief, said the ruling “apparently will reward justifiably and proportionately the Indian-American students in America, especially Ivy League colleges for their par excellence academic performances in future”.

Yet Indians and other Asians may not be really safe from the sting of affirmative action even after the court verdict.

The Ivy League universities have dropped the SAT scores requirement, which would would expose race-based discrimination, and will instead be using factors like the socio-economic backgrounds, adversities overcome, including due to discrimination, and personality traits (on which Asians already scored low) in their quest for diversity.

Some of these are subjective and less open to empirical evaluation like SAT scores making them more liable to be manipulated and not seem racially tainted.

Moreover, unlike some Asian groups, Indians have the highest income among ethnic groups in the US and high education levels that would put them at a disadvantage when socio-economic factors are taken into account.

Among Indians, there is a contradiction in attitudes to affirmative action despite its impact on them.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 60 per cent of Indians say affirmative action is a “good thing” and only 13 per cent that it was a “bad thing”.

This may reflect the Indians’ political leanings: 68 per cent of Indian voters are supporters of the Democratic Party and nearly the same percentage of Indians were supportive of affirmative action.

While overall 50 per cent of Americans “disapprove” affirmative action and only 33 per cent “approve”, 50 per cent of Democrats or party supporters approve, according to Pew.

Thomas Abraham, chairman of the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO) which also joined the Asian brief against affirmative action, reflected on the ""need for diversity. “

""We didn’t want the whole affirmative action to go away, but at the same time, we didn’t want Asian Americans to be discriminated in the general quota of admissions. We hope that the universities can achieve both,” he said.

The over-representation of Asians in coveted educational and employment opportunities has drawn the ire of social justice groups and activists, although they avoid directly speaking of them and often make it appear directed against Whites.

It starts at the level of advanced programmes for school children and is now creeping towards tech jobs, where Indians and other Asians are disproportionally represented -- for example nearly 45 per cent of Google (NASDAQ: ) employees, in contrast to African-Americans who made up 5.3 per cent despite being 13.6 per cent of the population.

Because of the criticism of the social justice groups that has been taken up by Democratic Party politicians, companies like Google, Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) have committed to increasing the hiring of other minorities.

They filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting affirmative action and against the SFA case.

Now they may face a legal minefield in how they frame their diversity programmes.

""There are indications that the following (vulnerabilities) may be under limited, targeted exploitation -- CVE-2022-26083, CVE-2021-29256, and CVE-2022-2136,"" reads Android Security Bulletin.

According to BleepingComputer, CVE-2022-26083 is a medium-severity memory leak flaw in the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips that was exploited in a December 2022 exploit chain that delivered spyware to Samsung (KS: ) devices.

CVE-2021-29256 is a critical (CVSS v3.1: 8.8) unprivileged information disclosure and root privilege escalation vulnerability that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2022-2136, is a critical-severity one with a score of 9.6 out of 10 as it is an integer overflow bug in Skia, Google's open-source multi-platform 2D graphics library that is also used in Chrome, where it was fixed in April, the report said.

Moreover, the report mentioned that CVE-2022-21250, a critical vulnerability in Android's System component that affects Android versions 11, 12, and 13, is the most serious of the security issues that Google fixed this month.

The Android security update for this month covers Android versions 11, 12, and 13, but depending on the scope of the addressed vulnerabilities, they may affect older OS versions that are no longer supported.

Last month, Google issued a security update for the Chrome web browser to address the third zero-day vulnerability exploited by hackers this year.

2022-07-06, Investing.com,"This is how much Microsoft can profit from its ChatGPT bet, according to Morgan Stanley",https://in.investing.com/news/this-is-how-much-microsoft-can-profit-from-its-chatgpt-bet-according-to-morgan-stanley-432SI-3713496,"Morgan Stanley analysts have tried to frame the AI opportunity for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the company’s stock continues to outperform on the back of the generative AI revolution.

Back in January, Microsoft announced it has extended its partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI through a “multiyear, multibillion dollar investment” with the aim of accelerating the AI revolution. Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019, before increasing its stake in 2021 and ultimately this year.

At the core of the new partnership is the generative AI technology, namely OpenAI’s models that have been incorporated across Microsoft’s consumer and enterprise products.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft.

“In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”

This is exactly what Microsoft is doing. The company introduced Copilot, a platform that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to significantly increase productivity.

Microsoft also introduced the “new Bing,” which aims to take its competition to Google Search to a whole new level. Fueled by generative AI technology, Bing offers results and answers to users’ questions.

How much is AI opportunity worth for Microsoft?

The accelerated rollout of generative AI technology is one of the key reasons why Wall Street analysts are still very positive on Microsoft stock, despite 41% year-to-date gains.

Morgan Stanley analysts note that “several initial trend-lines indicate Microsoft stands best positioned in Enterprise Software to benefit from Generative AI.”

“Assuming minimal penetration of what we estimate can be up to a $90 billion incremental opportunity for the company in FY25,” they wrote in a note sent to Morgan Stanley’s clients on Thursday.

As a result, Microsoft is a new Top Pick in Morgan Stanley’s Large Cap software “given the strong Generative AI positioning, business models able to reflect demand shifts quickly (notably the consumption model within Azure) and potential for further margin expansion against a still reasonable GAAP P/E multiple.”

The price target on MSFT stock goes to $415 per share, up from the prior $335.

Morgan Stanley’s comments come after Wedbush analysts said yesterday they expect Microsoft will become the next $3 trillion company after Apple (NASDAQ: ).

“We strongly believe the first step for MSFT was Azure/Office 365 with the next step ChatGPT/AI monetization on both the consumer and enterprise fronts combined adding $40 to $50 per share to MSFT's sum-of-the-parts valuation,” they said.

“With AI the next step we believe on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that MSFT should join Apple in the exclusive $3 trillion club by early 2024.”"

The class-action lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, claims that ""Twitter has refused to engage in arbitration -- despite having compelled employees to arbitrate their claims"".

Since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, the company has been accused of a variety of unlawful acts, including failing to pay laid off employees promised severance payments, discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, age, and disability, failing to pay promised bonuses, violating the WARN Act and FMLA, and other violations.

""Approximately 2,000 of Twitter's former employees have attempted to pursue arbitration claims against the company, following Twitter's successfully moving to compel arbitration in several federal class action cases in court against it,"" according to the new lawsuit.

According to the complaint, the arbitration agreements require ex-employees to pay a nominal filing fee to launch claims with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), but after that, Twitter has to pay ""all other arbitration fees"".

This latest lawsuit is part of a slew of litigation between Twitter and several thousands of employees who lost jobs when Musk took over last year.

The micro-blogging platform had a legal victory earlier this year that forced thousands of laid-off employees into arbitration.

Twitter is also facing a lawsuit after being accused of failing to pay for services for offices located in London, Dublin, Sydney and Singapore.

A Sydney-based infrastructure company Facilitate is seeking more than $1 million Australian dollars in payments across the three businesses for alleged owed payments that date back to October of last year, when Musk acquired Twitter, according to reports.

Reports also surfaced that the micro-blogging platform refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract came up for renewal in June.

However, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino reportedly settled the strained ties with Google Cloud over non-payments of its bills before the June 30 contract deadline.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.

PaLM 2 is the language model underpinning Google's Bard.

According to the report, the tech giant believes that its improved model will be especially useful in places with ""more limited access to doctors"".

Google believes Med-PaLM 2 will be better at healthcare conversations than generalised chatbots such as Bard, Bing, and ChatGPT because it was trained on a curated set of medical expert demonstrations.

Moreover, the report mentioned that the customers testing Med-PaLM 2 will control their data, which will be encrypted, and Google won't have access to it.

As per Google's senior research director Greg Corrado, Med-PaLM 2 is still in its early stages.

Corrado stated that, while he would not want it to be a part of his own family's ""healthcare journey"", he believes Med-PaLM 2 ""takes the places in healthcare where AI can be beneficial and expands them by 10-fold"".

Meanwhile, Google has updated its privacy policy, stating that it can use publicly available data to help train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.

In an interview with IANS, the senior interventional cardiologist and clinical director at Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, explained some of the recent advances in the domain of heart heath.

Q: How do you look at the recent study that Vitamin D might reduce the risk of heart attacks and prevent irregular heartbeats?

A: These are not therapies for these problems. These are in addition to what all other measures a person takes. People might think that Vitamin D is the only thing. Heart disease is a multi-factor disorder.

Still, the standard risk factors remain diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and family. These have strong correlation. Vitamin D to treat or to prevent heart attack is still a long term goal even going by this study.

Many studies might come on various factors and they might choose positive benefits but for these positive benefits to translate to clinical medicine is a long process.

There are many medications which can definitely reduce the heart event rate but for this many factors have to be addressed properly.

Vitamin D is a very soft target not a hard point. It is not the only thing. People should not think that if I take Vitamin D, I will be okay. I think fundamentals remain the same.

Diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and physical activity continue to remain major pillars. These risk factors have to be addressed to prevent heart attack.

Q: How common is atrial fibrillation in the Indian context?

A: Atrial fibrillation is worsening like heart disease. It is a multifactorial disease. Most of the patients of atrial fibrillation are elderly women they have underlying hypertension, diabetes and they have stiff heart syndrome. In this group of patients prone to develop atrial fibrillation there are many hard end points which we can address rather than focusing on Vitamin D.

Vitamin D is not a major risk factor. In the Indian context also, atrial fibrillation is an emerging epidemic.

The main reasons are still uncontrolled high blood pressure, aging process and stiff heart. These will continue to be the main promoters of development atrial fibrillation. As a doctor, I would prefer to treat them rather than treat a very soft end point like Vitamin D.

Q: Will the use of higher doses of Vitamin D for a longer period negatively impact patients? If yes, what are the risks?

A: Yes. That is one of the major reasons why one should be very careful. Somebody might think what is the harm in consuming Vitamin D as it is a simple medication but that's not the way. Unsupervised Vitamin D use for a prolonged period of time can lead to lot of medical complications.

Some people might develop renal dysfunction, some people might develop hyperparathyroidism or produce more calcium (hypercalcemia). There are a lot of metabolic problems that may happen if somebody takes long duration vitamin D without proper medical supervision.

Presence of deficiency of Vitamin D and its correction are not the same. Sometimes correction of vitamin D deficiency might not reduce the primary problem. Prolonged consumption of Vitamin D and unsupervised especially elderly people tend to develop more complications.

One should be cautious in taking Vitamin D without supervision. Having said that, there are a lot of natural sources for production of Vitamin D. I would prefer my patients to have a natural way to produce Vitamin D by their body as a medication.

I encourage my patients to have 15 minutes of sunlight at least 2-3 times a week and at least once a week, do traditional remedies like application of castor oil to promote internal development of Vitamin D. These are simple measures one can take and naturally produce Vitamin much more quantitatively better.

Q-What are the other new or recent discoveries for managing heart health?

In the management of heart health, what the recent advances suggest is to stick to the traditional risk factors only. We now have a lot of objective data.

Let us consider Lipid. We have a lot of data which emerged in the last one decade indicating that people should target their Lipid. There is a lot of misinformation and misconception which are being propelled by various sources indicating that one should not believe in Lipid but we have strong data on the management of Lipid.

We have clear-cut numbers. What is LDL cholesterol a person should have. The numbers are different for a person who does not have heart attack and the one who had heart attack.

For a person who does not have a heart attack but has only Diabetes, we aim for LDL of less than 70. Same for a person with heart attack we aim for LDL cholesterol of less than 55. Same for a person who has got a high risk we aim for less than 35.

Previously we never used to aim for such low levels of LDL cholesterol. Now we understand that a very low level of LDL cholesterol will reduce the risk of having a cardiac event. This is one of the important advances which I think people have to be aware of.

There are different cut-off levels. When people go to a laboratory, the normal value of cholesterol creates confusion.

They will try to remain at a much higher level than what is desired for them. A lot of personalised medicine is coming for different subsections of people. It might look very less interesting for people but it is a very important and also inexpensive way to reduce the risk of heart attack.

One of the common ways to reduce heart attacks is to use aspirin. We all think that taking aspirin a day reduces the risk. Now with the availability of new data, we can understand that certain groups of patients get benefited and certain groups of patients can get harmed.

What we understand is that aspirin used for patients less than 60 who have diabetes and hypertension, they get better whereas for patients who are more than 60 years, we have to select patients who are going to be benefited rather than using aspirin for all of them as a blanket.

Aspirin therapy is very useful for prevention of heart stroke in people who already had a heart attack but for those people who never had a heart attack in the past or who never had bypass surgery, it is better to limit the use of aspirin among people who are less than 60.

So we have to differentiate between those who had heart attack angioplasty vis-a-vis those who never had an event and use aspirin selectively for people who already had heart attack and for those who did not have heart attack, we need to calculate the risk and then only use benefit of the therapy.

We now understand that women tend to have a higher risk of heart attack than what we were thinking in the past. Now a days, we see a lot of women also developing heart attacks. That is due to multiple to new risk factors which we were hitherto not knowing.

These risk are enhancers: for women who tend to premature menopause naturally or surgically, they will have a higher risk of heart attack. Premature means less than 40.

Women who have immunological disorders like Rheumatoid arthritis or SLE tend to have higher chances of heart attack. Such women possibly take aspirin to prevent heart attack.

In addition to traditional risk factors, we have risk enhancing factors for women and people who have South Asian ancestry like Indians. They play an important role for the development of heart attacks.

South Asian ancestry people tend to have higher risk of heart attack especially those with a family history of heart attacks in less than 50 years of age. Those people are at higher risk of developing heart attacks. That is also considered a risk enhancer.

That's why you see a lot of young people developing heart attacks among the Indian population because of our propensity. It is not considered as risk factor but considered risk enhancer

Compared to the past we are seeing more and more women developing heart attacks at younger age. Previously we were not seeing this. Women who tend to have higher blood pressure during pregnancy may develop heart attacks. This is also considered a risk enhancer for a heart attack.

Q: Is building more data helping understand the risk factors and risk enhances better?

A: We continue to get data. The larger the data set, better we can understand the association.

Risk scores have also been developed. These risk scores help us to estimate what is the risk of a particular person to a heart attack in the next 10 years. With these risk scores, objective risk assessment is possible compared to what we used to assess risk in a subjective way.

For the Indian population who are having a risk of more than 10 per cent, it is considered high risk in India. This means more than 10 per cent chance of having a heart attack in the next 10 years is considered high risk in India.

Indian race and south Asian ancestry itself is a risk enhancer. If risk calculation is more than 10 per cent, it is considered high risk whereas the same for any other race, we consider high risk if it is more than 20 per cent. The bar is set at the lower level for the Indian population.

Clinical practitioners and even lay persons calculate risk score. Easiest risk score they use is by the American Heart Association. This risk score calculator is developed in the form of an app and available on Google (NASDAQ: ) as well as Apple (NASDAQ: ) store. It is an ASCVD risk calculator. This is an objective app. A person can calculate the risk.

Risk score gives an idea what medication one should take. For example whether a person should take aspirin, cholesterol lowering medication, blood pressure medication, and what lifestyle modification is required. One can also know how much risk reduction is possible by adhering to those lifestyle modifications.

Indians calculating risk on ASCVD need to choose an 'other' group which happens to be of South Asian ancestry. More than 20 per cent risk score is considered high risk in the American context while for Indian people, more than 10 per cent risk is considered high risk.

2022-07-07, Investing.com,Top 7 companies buying back the most stock,https://in.investing.com/news/top-7-companies-buying-back-the-most-stock-432SI-3715283,"As the Q2 earnings season is set to start, investors will also get a glimpse into how corporate share repurchase plans are progressing. While stock buybacks are sometimes viewed as controversial, the greatest investor of all time – Warren Buffett – is a big proponent of them.

""The math isn’t complicated: When the share count goes down, your interest in our many businesses goes up,"" Buffett said about share repurchases in his 2022 annual letter to shareholders. ""Every small bit helps if repurchases are made at value-accretive prices."" He went on to say that those that criticize share repurchases are ""either an economic illiterate or a silver-tongued demagogue.""

Below we highlight the top seven S&P 500 companies that bought back the most stock in Q1 and are working off massive share repurchase plans in the current quarter:

Apple (NASDAQ: ) bought back $20.012 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $21.791 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $22.961 billion in Q1 2022. In May of 2022, the board of directors of Apple authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) bought back $14.557 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $15.407 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $13.3 billion in Q1 2022. In April of 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $70.0 billion of its Class A and Class C shares.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) bought back $10.374 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $7.52 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $10.431 billion in Q1 2022. In February of 2022, Meta announced a $40 billion increase in their share repurchase authorization.

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) bought back $5.509 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $5.459 billion in Q4 2022 and down from $8.822 billion in Q1 2022. In September of 2021, the Board of Directors of Microsoft approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $60.0 billion in share repurchases. As of March 31, 2022, $26.9 billion remained of this $60.0 billion share repurchase program.

T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: ) bought back $4.806 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $2.461 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $172 million in Q1 2022. As of April 21, 2022, T-Mobile US has a remaining authorization of up to $5.5 billion through the end of September 2022.

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) (NYSE: ) bought back $4.45 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, up from $2.608 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $3.180 billion in Q1 2022. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman of the Board and chief executive officer, and Charlie Munger, vice chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.

Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) bought back $4.34 billion in stock in the first quarter of 2022, down from $4.675 billion in Q4 2022 and up from $2.067 billion in Q1 2022. In December of 2022, Exxon Mobil announced an expansion of its $30 billion share-repurchase program, which is now up to $50 billion through 2024."
2022-07-07, IANS,"Reservations followed Indians to US, now they may get reprieve (IANS Column: Out of Turn)",https://in.investing.com/news/reservations-followed-indians-to-us-now-they-may-get-reprieve-ians-column-out-of-turn-3714602,"New York, July 7 (IANS) Some Indian immigrants to the US used to say that a reason for coming here was the reservations policy in university admissions and jobs in their homeland and they wanted their children to escape its clutches. But it followed them here in the form of affirmative action in universities and government programmes and threatened to spill over into technology and science jobs.The US Supreme Court’s ruling last week in cases involving Harvard and the Univerity of North Carolina that race-based affirmative action programmes violated the Constitution’s provisions on equality of all may give them a reprieve, but risks persist.

The cases were brought by an organisation called Students for Fair Admissions (SFA) primarily on behalf of Asian students with high academic credentials denied admission because of the affirmative action programmes.

Three Indian and two Hindu organisations joined other Asian organisations in filing a brief before the Supreme Court supporting the case because Indians are a part of the Asian demographic.

Explicit racial quotas -- similar to the reservations in India -- were always illegal in the US and the affirmative action programmes skirted it by using other strategies like awarding almost uniformly low scores for personality factors like “likeability” and being “respected” to Asian students to bring down their rating for admissions, while boosting admissions of others.

Universities justified their action claiming that they wanted a student body more representative of the general population. The Asian groups’ court brief pointed out that admissions counsellors and guides advised Asian students “to hide their identity, to emphasize personal characteristics that avoid Asian stereotypes”.

Vijay Chokalingam, the brother of Hollywood actress and producer Mindy Kaling, exposed how it works.

Challenged by mediocre scores on the medical school entrance test, he modified his name to “JoJo Ingam” and altered his appearance on the photograph with the application in a way to be mistaken for an African-American and found a coveted seat.

The Asian brief said, “in the hierarchy of race, Asian American applicants rank lowest at Harvard”.

But if the Indian hierarchy of castes for reservations were to be applied to the US affirmative programmes, Asians would be considered the “highest”, the Whites as something similar to backward castes and African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans as the equivalent of scheduled castes.

The affirmative action programmes that sought in effect to limit admissions of Asians also benefitted Whites. And here’s why:

Although most of the rhetoric was about White privilege needing a correctie, in reality, Asian students had to score 140 points more than White students in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) for admission to elite universities, according to a study by two Princeton University scholars.

SAT, along with another known as ACT, was used to help determine the academic capacbitiies of undergraduate applicants.

The apparent rationale for limiting Asian admissions by Harvard, but not openly admitted, was that they are over-represented:

They are 6.3 per cent of the US population, but make up 27.9 per cent of students admitted to Harvard College, the university’s undergraduate division.

While some supporters view affirmative action as a form of reparation for the history of slavery of African-Americans, and discrimination against them, Latinos and Native Americans, those responsible for it were some Whites.

But Asians were being made to pay the price for it. And that despite Asians also having been discriminated against: In fact, Indians had faced the discrimination of being excluded from immigration under a 1917 legislation till 1964 and those already here were not allowed to own land in California under a 1913 legislation.

Raj Razdan, president of The National Federation of Indian American Associations (NFIA), which was one of the groups that joined in filing the Supreme Court brief, said the ruling “apparently will reward justifiably and proportionately the Indian-American students in America, especially Ivy League colleges for their par excellence academic performances in future”.

Yet Indians and other Asians may not be really safe from the sting of affirmative action even after the court verdict.

The Ivy League universities have dropped the SAT scores requirement, which would would expose race-based discrimination, and will instead be using factors like the socio-economic backgrounds, adversities overcome, including due to discrimination, and personality traits (on which Asians already scored low) in their quest for diversity.

Some of these are subjective and less open to empirical evaluation like SAT scores making them more liable to be manipulated and not seem racially tainted.

Moreover, unlike some Asian groups, Indians have the highest income among ethnic groups in the US and high education levels that would put them at a disadvantage when socio-economic factors are taken into account.

Among Indians, there is a contradiction in attitudes to affirmative action despite its impact on them.

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 60 per cent of Indians say affirmative action is a “good thing” and only 13 per cent that it was a “bad thing”.

This may reflect the Indians’ political leanings: 68 per cent of Indian voters are supporters of the Democratic Party and nearly the same percentage of Indians were supportive of affirmative action.

While overall 50 per cent of Americans “disapprove” affirmative action and only 33 per cent “approve”, 50 per cent of Democrats or party supporters approve, according to Pew.

Thomas Abraham, chairman of the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin (GOPIO) which also joined the Asian brief against affirmative action, reflected on the ""need for diversity. “

""We didn’t want the whole affirmative action to go away, but at the same time, we didn’t want Asian Americans to be discriminated in the general quota of admissions. We hope that the universities can achieve both,” he said.

The over-representation of Asians in coveted educational and employment opportunities has drawn the ire of social justice groups and activists, although they avoid directly speaking of them and often make it appear directed against Whites.

It starts at the level of advanced programmes for school children and is now creeping towards tech jobs, where Indians and other Asians are disproportionally represented -- for example nearly 45 per cent of Google (NASDAQ: ) employees, in contrast to African-Americans who made up 5.3 per cent despite being 13.6 per cent of the population.

Because of the criticism of the social justice groups that has been taken up by Democratic Party politicians, companies like Google, Meta (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Apple (NASDAQ: ) have committed to increasing the hiring of other minorities.

They filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting affirmative action and against the SFA case.

Now they may face a legal minefield in how they frame their diversity programmes.

""There are indications that the following (vulnerabilities) may be under limited, targeted exploitation -- CVE-2022-26083, CVE-2021-29256, and CVE-2022-2136,"" reads Android Security Bulletin.

According to BleepingComputer, CVE-2022-26083 is a medium-severity memory leak flaw in the Arm Mali GPU driver for Bifrost, Avalon, and Valhall chips that was exploited in a December 2022 exploit chain that delivered spyware to Samsung (KS: ) devices.

CVE-2021-29256 is a critical (CVSS v3.1: 8.8) unprivileged information disclosure and root privilege escalation vulnerability that affects specific versions of the Bifrost and Midgard Arm Mali GPU kernel drivers.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2022-2136, is a critical-severity one with a score of 9.6 out of 10 as it is an integer overflow bug in Skia, Google's open-source multi-platform 2D graphics library that is also used in Chrome, where it was fixed in April, the report said.

Moreover, the report mentioned that CVE-2022-21250, a critical vulnerability in Android's System component that affects Android versions 11, 12, and 13, is the most serious of the security issues that Google fixed this month.

The Android security update for this month covers Android versions 11, 12, and 13, but depending on the scope of the addressed vulnerabilities, they may affect older OS versions that are no longer supported.

Last month, Google issued a security update for the Chrome web browser to address the third zero-day vulnerability exploited by hackers this year.

2022-07-06, Investing.com,"This is how much Microsoft can profit from its ChatGPT bet, according to Morgan Stanley",https://in.investing.com/news/this-is-how-much-microsoft-can-profit-from-its-chatgpt-bet-according-to-morgan-stanley-432SI-3713496,"Morgan Stanley analysts have tried to frame the AI opportunity for Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the company’s stock continues to outperform on the back of the generative AI revolution.

Back in January, Microsoft announced it has extended its partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI through a “multiyear, multibillion dollar investment” with the aim of accelerating the AI revolution. Microsoft initially invested in OpenAI in 2019, before increasing its stake in 2021 and ultimately this year.

At the core of the new partnership is the generative AI technology, namely OpenAI’s models that have been incorporated across Microsoft’s consumer and enterprise products.

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft.

“In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models, and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”

This is exactly what Microsoft is doing. The company introduced Copilot, a platform that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to significantly increase productivity.

Microsoft also introduced the “new Bing,” which aims to take its competition to Google Search to a whole new level. Fueled by generative AI technology, Bing offers results and answers to users’ questions.

How much is AI opportunity worth for Microsoft?

The accelerated rollout of generative AI technology is one of the key reasons why Wall Street analysts are still very positive on Microsoft stock, despite 41% year-to-date gains.

Morgan Stanley analysts note that “several initial trend-lines indicate Microsoft stands best positioned in Enterprise Software to benefit from Generative AI.”

“Assuming minimal penetration of what we estimate can be up to a $90 billion incremental opportunity for the company in FY25,” they wrote in a note sent to Morgan Stanley’s clients on Thursday.

As a result, Microsoft is a new Top Pick in Morgan Stanley’s Large Cap software “given the strong Generative AI positioning, business models able to reflect demand shifts quickly (notably the consumption model within Azure) and potential for further margin expansion against a still reasonable GAAP P/E multiple.”

The price target on MSFT stock goes to $415 per share, up from the prior $335.

Morgan Stanley’s comments come after Wedbush analysts said yesterday they expect Microsoft will become the next $3 trillion company after Apple (NASDAQ: ).

“We strongly believe the first step for MSFT was Azure/Office 365 with the next step ChatGPT/AI monetization on both the consumer and enterprise fronts combined adding $40 to $50 per share to MSFT's sum-of-the-parts valuation,” they said.

“With AI the next step we believe on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that MSFT should join Apple in the exclusive $3 trillion club by early 2024.”"

The class-action lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, claims that ""Twitter has refused to engage in arbitration -- despite having compelled employees to arbitrate their claims"".

Since Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, the company has been accused of a variety of unlawful acts, including failing to pay laid off employees promised severance payments, discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, age, and disability, failing to pay promised bonuses, violating the WARN Act and FMLA, and other violations.

""Approximately 2,000 of Twitter's former employees have attempted to pursue arbitration claims against the company, following Twitter's successfully moving to compel arbitration in several federal class action cases in court against it,"" according to the new lawsuit.

According to the complaint, the arbitration agreements require ex-employees to pay a nominal filing fee to launch claims with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), but after that, Twitter has to pay ""all other arbitration fees"".

This latest lawsuit is part of a slew of litigation between Twitter and several thousands of employees who lost jobs when Musk took over last year.

The micro-blogging platform had a legal victory earlier this year that forced thousands of laid-off employees into arbitration.

Twitter is also facing a lawsuit after being accused of failing to pay for services for offices located in London, Dublin, Sydney and Singapore.

A Sydney-based infrastructure company Facilitate is seeking more than $1 million Australian dollars in payments across the three businesses for alleged owed payments that date back to October of last year, when Musk acquired Twitter, according to reports.

Reports also surfaced that the micro-blogging platform refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract came up for renewal in June.

However, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino reportedly settled the strained ties with Google Cloud over non-payments of its bills before the June 30 contract deadline.

Big tech helped the broader market cut early-day losses as Meta surged more than 3% to 52-week highs ahead of its launch of rival Twitter app Threads expected on Thursday.

The launch of the app comes just days after Twitter said it would temporarily restrict how many posts users can read on its platform.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) fell 0.6% though its market cap remains above $3 trillion, while Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) inched higher, with the latter touted by Wedbush to join the $3 trillion club by early 2024 amid an AI-led boom.

“[W]ith AI the next step we believe on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that MSFT should join Apple in the exclusive $3 trillion club by early 2024,” Wedbush said in a Wednesday note.

The analysts note that Google Search's market share “appears to be holding steady” despite an ultra-aggressive offensive from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Bing.

“June share at ~93% has actually improved ~50 bps versus late '22. AI is now embedded in Search via Bard / Labs test & Google appears to have a path toward monetization. But we do acknowledge minor loss in browser share to Safari & Edge,” analysts said in a client note.

When it comes to the YTD stock rally of about 35%, analysts still see an attractive valuation.

“Google still trades at a ~15%+ discount on NTM earnings vs the '17-'19 period. We see room for further multiple expansion as the narrative that Google is losing in AI search dissipates… The next ~2-3 quarters for Search estimates also look beatable: Street numbers imply a deceleration in 4-year & 5-year stacks after improving in 1Q23,” the analysts added."
2022-07-05, IANS,E-commerce growth in India to hit $150 bn by 2026: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/ecommerce-growth-in-india-to-hit-150-bn-by-2026-report-3711774,"New Delhi, July 5 (IANS) The e-commerce transaction value in India is likely to rise from $83 billion in 2022 to nearly $150 billion in 2026 at a 16 per cent compound annual growth rate, a report showed on Wednesday.The Philippines, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Vietnam are projected to lead e-commerce growth in APAC through 2026, according to the FIS Global Payments Report 2022.

“India has emerged as a global payments leader, developing the next generation of real-time payments infrastructure with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a project of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),” said the report.

UPI’s dramatic success derives largely from its seamless interoperability with commercial wallets such as Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, Paytm (NS: ) and PhonePe, it added.

Meanwhile, the global e-commerce transaction value is likely to rise from $6 trillion in 2022 to over $8.5 trillion in 2026 at a 9 per cent compound annual growth rate, according to the report.

The explosive growth in global e-commerce in the first two years of the pandemic has slightly slowed in 2022, with a 10 per cent YoY growth in global e-commerce transaction value from 2021-2022.

Despite reduced growth rates compared to the initial pandemic period, the forecast for global e-commerce remains bullish.

“All regions except Europe saw double-digit growth from 2021-2022, with the highest growth of 21 per cent in the Middle East and Africa. Markets in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, except for Thailand at 9 per cent, continue to be high-growth markets,” said the report.

In India, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) at Ministry of Commerce is envisioned to create a facilitative model to revolutionise digital commerce, giving greater thrust to penetration of retail e-commerce in India. Common Services Centres (CSC), under the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), said it has invested in the ONDC to promote e-commerce and logistics in rural areas.

Currently, the ONDC network has more than 40,000 sellers live in over 200 cities.

“It is for the first time that CSC has invested in an initiative like this. ONDC will democratise digital commerce by moving to an open network. The partnership will also generate employment opportunities for rural youth by enabling a last mile logistics network,” said Dinesh Tyagi, MD, CSC SPV.

However, some challenges still need to be addressed to sustain this growth.

For example, the report said the lack of digital infrastructure and financial inclusion in some emerging markets can hinder e-commerce growth.

Additionally, regulatory challenges and cross-border trade barriers can create obstacles for businesses looking to expand globally, it added.

In its privacy policy archive page, Google updated the changes, saying: ""For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s languageAI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.""

With the new policy, Google is informing people that anything they publicly post online can be used to train Bard, future versions and other generative AI products it develops.

Critics have expressed concerns about companies' use of publicly available information to train large language models for generative AI use.

Last month, the Sam Altman-run OpenAI sued in a class-action lawsuit in the US for allegedly stealing data from the public to train its AI chatbot ChatGPT.

The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, alleged that OpenAI used “stolen data to train and develop” its products including ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, DALL-E, and VALL-E.

Threads is expected to launch on Thursday in the US and UK as an alternative to Twitter.

The new platform is designed to import data from Instagram, including behavioural and advertising information.

In its US format, the platform informs users that it will collect a wide range of information about them, including health information, financial information, browsing histories, location, purchases, contacts, search history and sensitive information.

However, in the EU format, the Irish regulator has prevented Meta from launching advertising services on WhatsApp that use data from Facebook or Instagram.

In the US, where privacy laws are weaker, the tech giant is permitted to combine the two data streams, said the report.

The DPC has not actively blocked the service, instead, the company is still preparing it for a European launch outside the UK, which does not fully comply with GDPR.

Last week, Meta's Twitter competitor briefly appeared on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store.

Since January, Threads has been under development at Meta under the name ""Project 92"".

""We've been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, that they believe that they can trust and rely upon for distribution,"" Meta chief product officer Chris Cox had said.

The temporary protection meant that she “had more time than others to process the shock”, than others.

“After 10 years at a company that has always given me so much, the redundancy email was a major plot twist.""

Triess noted she served several roles at the tech giant: “first Google Books, then Google Movies and TV, but most of all Mental Health & Wellbeing”.

“I'm proud to have played an active role in the company's wellbeing programme as I was on the receiving end countless times. I wouldn't be the person I am today without it.""

She thanked Google for “the opportunity to contribute, learn and grow at work, and live a healthy and inspired life beyond”.

Triess said that LinkedIn has become her “new favourite social channel”, and that she has been doing courses and coaching, reading and researching the job market -- all while looking after a baby.

It “has not been easy but now that he's one”.

Triess said she is clear on what she has to do next, even though her journey feels like “making clumsy moves on a dating app for the first time since coming out of a long-term relationship!”

On January 20, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had confirmed in a letter to employees that about 12,000 people will be laid off globally, accounting for more than 6 per cent of the total workforce.

In March, the tech giant informed its employees via an email that fewer of them will be promoted to more senior levels this year as compared to the past. It reportedly also indicated to ex-employees who were laid off while on maternity or medical leave that they will not be paid for the remainder of their time off.

In April, in a memo, sent by Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, Google employees were reportedly notified that the perks such as free snacks and workout classes will vary based on the office location needs, and trends seen in each office space.

Google also told employees that some workers would have to share desk space, amid plans to downsize some of its offices.

As Twitter writes its own nemesis as it finally heads towards a fully paid service, Musk rivals have sensed the deep grudge among Twitter users.

Before Twitter owner Musk and Meta (NASDAQ: ) Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg enter a full-on cage fight (both are apparently preparing for the Jiu Jitsu showdown), Instagram Threads is expected to launch on Thursday, according to an App Store listing for the application.

""Say more with Threads -- Instagram’s text-based conversation app. Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow,"" according to Meta.

With the new Twitter-like app, users will be able to follow and connect directly with their favourite creators and others.

Last week, Threads briefly appeared on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store.

Since January, Threads has been under development at Meta under the name ""Project 92"". Meta has added a launch date teaser to the Instagram app.

Typing “threads” into the search box (or a number of other keywords) causes a ticket icon to appear on the search bar.

Another Twitter competitor Mastodon is witnessing a steep rise in new members.

According to its CEO Eugen Rochko, the number of active users across the decentralised social media platform went up by 2,94,000 over the weekend, as Twitter faced refresh rate limit and post viewing restrictions, especially for non-paid users.

Mastodon recently crossed more than 10 million registered accounts.

Sensing a big opportunity, Twitter rival Bluesky, backed by none other than Jack Dorsey who still feels that running Twitter is “hard”, has reopened the sign-ups that the company disabled a few days back.

""We just enabled account sign-ups again, so any outstanding invite codes can now be used to create an account,"" the company said in a screenshot shared by The Verge.

In an update, the platform said: ""We are still working to accommodate the large influx of users and increase in traffic.""

Meanwhile, popular messaging platform Telegram posted on Twitter: ""Don't worry, you can read as many Telegram posts as you want"".

Facing a myriad of issues, Musk has announced that the recent Twitter changes for users are temporary to ""address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation"".

However, the micro-blogging platform has now launched a new and improved version of the social media dashboard application for management 'TweetDeck' globally, saying that after 30 days, only verified users will be able to access the new app.

IMY issued administrative fines against two of the companies. One of the companies has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative, while IMY orders the other three to also stop using it.

Google Analytics is a tool for measuring and analysing traffic on websites.

The companies audited were CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri and Tele2.

IMY issued an administrative fine of 12 million SEK (over $1.1 million) against Tele2 and 300,000 SEK (around $30,000) against CDON.

“The audits are based on complaints from the organisation None of Your Business (NOYB) in the light of the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (CJEU). The complaints allege that the companies, in violation of the law, transfer personal data to the United States,” said the IMY in its ruling.

In its audits, IMY considered that the data transferred to the US via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred.

All four companies have based their decisions on the transfer of personal data via Google Analytics on standard contractual clauses.

“From IMY's audits, it appears that none of the companies' additional technical security measures are sufficient,” said the watchdog.

""Websites have control over whether crawlers can access their content.""

Twitter recently made some significant changes to the visibility of tweets on the platform.

Last week, the platform blocked unregistered users from being able to browse tweets. Later, it introduced ""temporary"" limits for the number of tweets people can read per day.

Levin's statement suggests that the modifications have affected how Google crawls Twitter.

When Search Engine Land compared the number of Twitter URLs that Google had indexed between Friday and Monday, the statistics clearly indicated that something was wrong.

Friday last week, Google had indexed 471 million results for ""site: twitter.com,"" but on Monday, that number was down to just 180 million.

""Given Twitter's rate limits on tweets are supposed to be temporary, there's a chance that if those lift, we might see the usual amount of tweets in Google search results in the future,"" the report said.

A Sydney-based infrastructure company Facilitate is seeking more than A$1 million in payments across the three businesses for alleged owed payments that date back to October of last year, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, The Guardian reported.

According to case documents, Facilitate offered sensor installation in Twitter's London and Dublin offices and an office fit-out in Singapore. Also, the infrastructure company decommissioned Twitter's Sydney office in Australia and temporarily stored its contents.

""The company claims it is owed £203,115, SGD$546,596, and A$61,318, respectively,"" the report said.

The case, filed in the US district court of Northern California at the end of last month, was first reported by NCA Newswire.

The firm claimed that after Musk took over Twitter, the micro-blogging platform did not dispute the invoices but instead chose not to pay them. Facilitate is seeking costs and damages.

Twitter has not yet submitted a defence filing, the report said.

In court filings, Facilitate stated that it is not the sole company suing Twitter since Musk took control.

According to the firm, Musk's moderation decisions, including the unbanning of far-right and neo-Nazi accounts, led to advertiser alienation and caused a financial crisis for the company.

""Twitter responded with a campaign of extreme belt-tightening that amounted to requiring nearly everyone to whom it owes money to sue,"" the firm said.

""Twitter stopped paying rent on some of its offices and stopped paying several vendors whose services it was still using. Twitter also cancelled many contracts and stopped paying people to whom it owes money.""

Meanwhile, last month, reports had surfaced that the micro-blogging platform refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract came up for renewal in June.

However, later, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino settled the strained ties with Google Cloud over non-payments of its bills before the June 30 contract deadline.

""The internet feels increasingly broken. News sites are paywalled or account walled, Reddit is nag walled, Google (NASDAQ: ) search spams ads and SEO to the point of uselessness, and now Twitter is account walled. Web browsing feels horrible now,"" Sweeney posted.

Musk replied: ""Several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively, to the point where it was affecting the real user experience. What should we do to stop that? I'm open to ideas.""

To which, Sweeney suggested that Twitter should thwart scraping patterns with ""infosec engineering, forbid bad forms of scraping in terms of service, add a volume based liquidated damages clause, prominently litigate against large scale commercial abuse"".

According to Musk, scraping is already disallowed by Twitter terms and conditions and the scraping organisations mask their IPs through proxy servers or through organisations that appear legit.

""For example, a recent massive scraping operation originating from Oracle (NYSE: ) IP addresses was just using their servers as a laundromat,"" said Musk.

Sweeney said that it is a cat-and-mouse game of rate-limiting or blocking the cloud hosts and VPN IP ranges, ""sending them a stream of cease & desists, and litigating against the AI companies employing the shady scraping sub-contractors"". ""There’s no winning, just a growing mouse stack,"" he argued.

The Consumer Affairs Ministry has, in fact, started helpline number 1915, where consumers are being encouraged to complain about such instances.

This facility began on June 28 and the ministry is confident that it would be able to get to some ""solid numbers"" on such instances by July 31.

Earlier this month, Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh had held a meeting with leading e-commerce platforms in Mumbai, where they were asked to refrain from indulging in dark pattern practices and were advised to practice self-restraint.

Sources said that during that meeting, the stakeholders had given a blanket assurance that they would look into the matter. However after 15 days, when the instances of consumers getting lured by such practices did not show any sign of abating, the helpline number was started on June 28.

The stakeholders have been informed by the government that complaints are now being registered regarding such malpractices, and once the specific guidelines are prepared within the next two months, then there is a likelihood of a jail term for offenders and their services could even be discontinued, official sources said.

There are several categories of dark pattern practices on e-commerce platforms which the government has identified. Some examples of these are false urgency, wherein the consumer is induced to purchase something under the pressure of being given a limited time offer on a particular product. Another example is that of ""confirm shaming"", where the consumer is lured by questions like ""are you sure you don't want to buy?""

Hidden cost is one of the common forms of such malpractice, where an online ticket is offered at a reduced rate but when it is purchased, the price is much more than it was offered earlier.

The ministry plans to take action on several influencers on social media, especially in the field of finance and health to begin with, mainly those who promote specific financial products or medicines. Their veracity needs to be verified and therefore their credentials would be checked, and if found to be false, then action would be taken as per the guidelines, ministry officials said.

2022-07-05, Investing.com,Google Search market share 'steady' amid AI arms race - Piper Sandler,https://in.investing.com/news/google-search-market-share-steady-amid-ai-arms-race--piper-sandler-432SI-3711814,"Piper Sandler analysts hiked the price target on Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to $140 per share from the prior $128 while remaining Overweight-rated.

The analysts note that Google Search's market share “appears to be holding steady” despite an ultra-aggressive offensive from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Bing.

“June share at ~93% has actually improved ~50 bps versus late '22. AI is now embedded in Search via Bard / Labs test & Google appears to have a path toward monetization. But we do acknowledge minor loss in browser share to Safari & Edge,” analysts said in a client note.

When it comes to the YTD stock rally of about 35%, analysts still see an attractive valuation.

“Google still trades at a ~15%+ discount on NTM earnings vs the '17-'19 period. We see room for further multiple expansion as the narrative that Google is losing in AI search dissipates… The next ~2-3 quarters for Search estimates also look beatable: Street numbers imply a deceleration in 4-year & 5-year stacks after improving in 1Q23,” the analysts added."
2022-07-05, IANS,E-commerce growth in India to hit $150 bn by 2026: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/ecommerce-growth-in-india-to-hit-150-bn-by-2026-report-3711774,"New Delhi, July 5 (IANS) The e-commerce transaction value in India is likely to rise from $83 billion in 2022 to nearly $150 billion in 2026 at a 16 per cent compound annual growth rate, a report showed on Wednesday.The Philippines, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Vietnam are projected to lead e-commerce growth in APAC through 2026, according to the FIS Global Payments Report 2022.

“India has emerged as a global payments leader, developing the next generation of real-time payments infrastructure with the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a project of the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),” said the report.

UPI’s dramatic success derives largely from its seamless interoperability with commercial wallets such as Google (NASDAQ: ) Pay, Paytm (NS: ) and PhonePe, it added.

Meanwhile, the global e-commerce transaction value is likely to rise from $6 trillion in 2022 to over $8.5 trillion in 2026 at a 9 per cent compound annual growth rate, according to the report.

The explosive growth in global e-commerce in the first two years of the pandemic has slightly slowed in 2022, with a 10 per cent YoY growth in global e-commerce transaction value from 2021-2022.

Despite reduced growth rates compared to the initial pandemic period, the forecast for global e-commerce remains bullish.

“All regions except Europe saw double-digit growth from 2021-2022, with the highest growth of 21 per cent in the Middle East and Africa. Markets in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, except for Thailand at 9 per cent, continue to be high-growth markets,” said the report.

In India, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), an initiative of the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) at Ministry of Commerce is envisioned to create a facilitative model to revolutionise digital commerce, giving greater thrust to penetration of retail e-commerce in India. Common Services Centres (CSC), under the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), said it has invested in the ONDC to promote e-commerce and logistics in rural areas.

Currently, the ONDC network has more than 40,000 sellers live in over 200 cities.

“It is for the first time that CSC has invested in an initiative like this. ONDC will democratise digital commerce by moving to an open network. The partnership will also generate employment opportunities for rural youth by enabling a last mile logistics network,” said Dinesh Tyagi, MD, CSC SPV.

However, some challenges still need to be addressed to sustain this growth.

For example, the report said the lack of digital infrastructure and financial inclusion in some emerging markets can hinder e-commerce growth.

Additionally, regulatory challenges and cross-border trade barriers can create obstacles for businesses looking to expand globally, it added.

In its privacy policy archive page, Google updated the changes, saying: ""For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s languageAI models and build products and features like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities. Or, if your business’s information appears on a website, we may index and display it on Google services.""

With the new policy, Google is informing people that anything they publicly post online can be used to train Bard, future versions and other generative AI products it develops.

Critics have expressed concerns about companies' use of publicly available information to train large language models for generative AI use.

Last month, the Sam Altman-run OpenAI sued in a class-action lawsuit in the US for allegedly stealing data from the public to train its AI chatbot ChatGPT.

The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California, alleged that OpenAI used “stolen data to train and develop” its products including ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4, DALL-E, and VALL-E.

Threads is expected to launch on Thursday in the US and UK as an alternative to Twitter.

The new platform is designed to import data from Instagram, including behavioural and advertising information.

In its US format, the platform informs users that it will collect a wide range of information about them, including health information, financial information, browsing histories, location, purchases, contacts, search history and sensitive information.

However, in the EU format, the Irish regulator has prevented Meta from launching advertising services on WhatsApp that use data from Facebook or Instagram.

In the US, where privacy laws are weaker, the tech giant is permitted to combine the two data streams, said the report.

The DPC has not actively blocked the service, instead, the company is still preparing it for a European launch outside the UK, which does not fully comply with GDPR.

Last week, Meta's Twitter competitor briefly appeared on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store.

Since January, Threads has been under development at Meta under the name ""Project 92"".

""We've been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, that they believe that they can trust and rely upon for distribution,"" Meta chief product officer Chris Cox had said.

The temporary protection meant that she “had more time than others to process the shock”, than others.

“After 10 years at a company that has always given me so much, the redundancy email was a major plot twist.""

Triess noted she served several roles at the tech giant: “first Google Books, then Google Movies and TV, but most of all Mental Health & Wellbeing”.

“I'm proud to have played an active role in the company's wellbeing programme as I was on the receiving end countless times. I wouldn't be the person I am today without it.""

She thanked Google for “the opportunity to contribute, learn and grow at work, and live a healthy and inspired life beyond”.

Triess said that LinkedIn has become her “new favourite social channel”, and that she has been doing courses and coaching, reading and researching the job market -- all while looking after a baby.

It “has not been easy but now that he's one”.

Triess said she is clear on what she has to do next, even though her journey feels like “making clumsy moves on a dating app for the first time since coming out of a long-term relationship!”

On January 20, Google CEO Sundar Pichai had confirmed in a letter to employees that about 12,000 people will be laid off globally, accounting for more than 6 per cent of the total workforce.

In March, the tech giant informed its employees via an email that fewer of them will be promoted to more senior levels this year as compared to the past. It reportedly also indicated to ex-employees who were laid off while on maternity or medical leave that they will not be paid for the remainder of their time off.

In April, in a memo, sent by Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, Google employees were reportedly notified that the perks such as free snacks and workout classes will vary based on the office location needs, and trends seen in each office space.

Google also told employees that some workers would have to share desk space, amid plans to downsize some of its offices.

2022-07-04, IANS,Several Twitter rivals flex their muscles as Musk restrict access,https://in.investing.com/news/several-twitter-rivals-flex-their-muscles-as-musk-restrict-access-3710589,"New Delhi, July 4 (IANS) The abrupt changes at Twitter under Elon Musk, that has left millions of users annoyed, has resulted in a surge in several competitor apps to the so-called ‘public digital square’ and leading the pack in Meta’s Threads that is set to be launched this week. As Twitter writes its own nemesis as it finally heads towards a fully paid service, Musk rivals have sensed the deep grudge among Twitter users.

Before Twitter owner Musk and Meta (NASDAQ: ) Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg enter a full-on cage fight (both are apparently preparing for the Jiu Jitsu showdown), Instagram Threads is expected to launch on Thursday, according to an App Store listing for the application.

""Say more with Threads -- Instagram’s text-based conversation app. Threads is where communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow,"" according to Meta.

With the new Twitter-like app, users will be able to follow and connect directly with their favourite creators and others.

Last week, Threads briefly appeared on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store.

Since January, Threads has been under development at Meta under the name ""Project 92"". Meta has added a launch date teaser to the Instagram app.

Typing “threads” into the search box (or a number of other keywords) causes a ticket icon to appear on the search bar.

Another Twitter competitor Mastodon is witnessing a steep rise in new members.

According to its CEO Eugen Rochko, the number of active users across the decentralised social media platform went up by 2,94,000 over the weekend, as Twitter faced refresh rate limit and post viewing restrictions, especially for non-paid users.

Mastodon recently crossed more than 10 million registered accounts.

Sensing a big opportunity, Twitter rival Bluesky, backed by none other than Jack Dorsey who still feels that running Twitter is “hard”, has reopened the sign-ups that the company disabled a few days back.

""We just enabled account sign-ups again, so any outstanding invite codes can now be used to create an account,"" the company said in a screenshot shared by The Verge.

In an update, the platform said: ""We are still working to accommodate the large influx of users and increase in traffic.""

Meanwhile, popular messaging platform Telegram posted on Twitter: ""Don't worry, you can read as many Telegram posts as you want"".

Facing a myriad of issues, Musk has announced that the recent Twitter changes for users are temporary to ""address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation"".

However, the micro-blogging platform has now launched a new and improved version of the social media dashboard application for management 'TweetDeck' globally, saying that after 30 days, only verified users will be able to access the new app.

IMY issued administrative fines against two of the companies. One of the companies has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative, while IMY orders the other three to also stop using it.

Google Analytics is a tool for measuring and analysing traffic on websites.

The companies audited were CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri and Tele2.

IMY issued an administrative fine of 12 million SEK (over $1.1 million) against Tele2 and 300,000 SEK (around $30,000) against CDON.

“The audits are based on complaints from the organisation None of Your Business (NOYB) in the light of the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (CJEU). The complaints allege that the companies, in violation of the law, transfer personal data to the United States,” said the IMY in its ruling.

In its audits, IMY considered that the data transferred to the US via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred.

All four companies have based their decisions on the transfer of personal data via Google Analytics on standard contractual clauses.

“From IMY's audits, it appears that none of the companies' additional technical security measures are sufficient,” said the watchdog.

""Websites have control over whether crawlers can access their content.""

Twitter recently made some significant changes to the visibility of tweets on the platform.

Last week, the platform blocked unregistered users from being able to browse tweets. Later, it introduced ""temporary"" limits for the number of tweets people can read per day.

Levin's statement suggests that the modifications have affected how Google crawls Twitter.

When Search Engine Land compared the number of Twitter URLs that Google had indexed between Friday and Monday, the statistics clearly indicated that something was wrong.

Friday last week, Google had indexed 471 million results for ""site: twitter.com,"" but on Monday, that number was down to just 180 million.

""Given Twitter's rate limits on tweets are supposed to be temporary, there's a chance that if those lift, we might see the usual amount of tweets in Google search results in the future,"" the report said.

2022-07-03, IANS,Twitter faces lawsuit over unpaid bills in 4 countries,https://in.investing.com/news/twitter-faces-lawsuit-over-unpaid-bills-in-4-countries-3709240,"San Francisco, July 3 (IANS) Elon Musk-owned Twitter is facing a lawsuit after being accused of failing to pay for services for offices located in London, Dublin, Sydney and Singapore. A Sydney-based infrastructure company Facilitate is seeking more than A$1 million in payments across the three businesses for alleged owed payments that date back to October of last year, when Elon Musk acquired Twitter, The Guardian reported.

According to case documents, Facilitate offered sensor installation in Twitter's London and Dublin offices and an office fit-out in Singapore. Also, the infrastructure company decommissioned Twitter's Sydney office in Australia and temporarily stored its contents.

""The company claims it is owed £203,115, SGD$546,596, and A$61,318, respectively,"" the report said.

The case, filed in the US district court of Northern California at the end of last month, was first reported by NCA Newswire.

The firm claimed that after Musk took over Twitter, the micro-blogging platform did not dispute the invoices but instead chose not to pay them. Facilitate is seeking costs and damages.

Twitter has not yet submitted a defence filing, the report said.

In court filings, Facilitate stated that it is not the sole company suing Twitter since Musk took control.

According to the firm, Musk's moderation decisions, including the unbanning of far-right and neo-Nazi accounts, led to advertiser alienation and caused a financial crisis for the company.

""Twitter responded with a campaign of extreme belt-tightening that amounted to requiring nearly everyone to whom it owes money to sue,"" the firm said.

""Twitter stopped paying rent on some of its offices and stopped paying several vendors whose services it was still using. Twitter also cancelled many contracts and stopped paying people to whom it owes money.""

Meanwhile, last month, reports had surfaced that the micro-blogging platform refused to pay Google (NASDAQ: ) Cloud bills as its contract came up for renewal in June.

However, later, Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino settled the strained ties with Google Cloud over non-payments of its bills before the June 30 contract deadline.

""The internet feels increasingly broken. News sites are paywalled or account walled, Reddit is nag walled, Google (NASDAQ: ) search spams ads and SEO to the point of uselessness, and now Twitter is account walled. Web browsing feels horrible now,"" Sweeney posted.

Musk replied: ""Several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively, to the point where it was affecting the real user experience. What should we do to stop that? I'm open to ideas.""

To which, Sweeney suggested that Twitter should thwart scraping patterns with ""infosec engineering, forbid bad forms of scraping in terms of service, add a volume based liquidated damages clause, prominently litigate against large scale commercial abuse"".

According to Musk, scraping is already disallowed by Twitter terms and conditions and the scraping organisations mask their IPs through proxy servers or through organisations that appear legit.

""For example, a recent massive scraping operation originating from Oracle (NYSE: ) IP addresses was just using their servers as a laundromat,"" said Musk.

Sweeney said that it is a cat-and-mouse game of rate-limiting or blocking the cloud hosts and VPN IP ranges, ""sending them a stream of cease & desists, and litigating against the AI companies employing the shady scraping sub-contractors"". ""There’s no winning, just a growing mouse stack,"" he argued.

The Consumer Affairs Ministry has, in fact, started helpline number 1915, where consumers are being encouraged to complain about such instances.

This facility began on June 28 and the ministry is confident that it would be able to get to some ""solid numbers"" on such instances by July 31.

Earlier this month, Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh had held a meeting with leading e-commerce platforms in Mumbai, where they were asked to refrain from indulging in dark pattern practices and were advised to practice self-restraint.

Sources said that during that meeting, the stakeholders had given a blanket assurance that they would look into the matter. However after 15 days, when the instances of consumers getting lured by such practices did not show any sign of abating, the helpline number was started on June 28.

The stakeholders have been informed by the government that complaints are now being registered regarding such malpractices, and once the specific guidelines are prepared within the next two months, then there is a likelihood of a jail term for offenders and their services could even be discontinued, official sources said.

There are several categories of dark pattern practices on e-commerce platforms which the government has identified. Some examples of these are false urgency, wherein the consumer is induced to purchase something under the pressure of being given a limited time offer on a particular product. Another example is that of ""confirm shaming"", where the consumer is lured by questions like ""are you sure you don't want to buy?""

Hidden cost is one of the common forms of such malpractice, where an online ticket is offered at a reduced rate but when it is purchased, the price is much more than it was offered earlier.

The ministry plans to take action on several influencers on social media, especially in the field of finance and health to begin with, mainly those who promote specific financial products or medicines. Their veracity needs to be verified and therefore their credentials would be checked, and if found to be false, then action would be taken as per the guidelines, ministry officials said.

The VC firm has been an early investor in unicorns such as Meesho and LEAD School.

“Integrating AI is now table stakes for any startup. Much like the platform shift to mobile in the past, the success of tech businesses will depend on how they leverage AI”, said Good Capital co-general partner Arjun Malhotra.

“This isn’t an AI-focused fund as much as a recognition of a land-grab moment, where startups leveraging AI in intelligent ways will have the right-to-win,” he added.

The company made investments in firms such as OrangeHealth which raised Series A funding from General Catalyst and Accel Partners, SimSim which was acquired by Google (NASDAQ: ), and SolarSquare which raised a $13mn Series A funding led by Lowercarbon and Elevation Capital.

“We invest with deep conviction by being lead investors for every investment we make”, said Good Capital co-GP Rohan Malhotra.

Some Android app developers will test the new type of ad as soon as later this year, reports The Verge.

The Digital Markets Act (DMA)-- a new regulation in the EU-- that is anticipated to take effect in the spring, provides Meta with an opportunity to try this feature. ""It deems Apple and Google as 'gatekeepers' and requires that they open up their mobile platforms to alternative methods of downloading apps,"" the report said.

Android technically already supports sideloading, though Google makes it challenging by integrating in-app charging and licensing with the Play Store and by displaying scary warnings whenever someone attempts to download an Android app from a different source.

Even yet, Meta believes that it is safer to run its test on Android first than Apple's iOS. The pitch made by the company to developers taking part in the test is that by hosting their Android apps and enabling direct Facebook downloads without forcing users to visit the Play Store, they will experience greater conversion rates for their app install ads.

Developers in the experiment could use whatever billing systems they like because, at least initially, Meta doesn't plan to collect a percentage of in-app income from participating apps, the report said.

""We’ve always been interested in helping developers distribute their apps, and new options would add more competition in this space. Developers deserve more ways to easily get their apps to the people that want them,"" said Meta spokesperson Tom Channick.

This also likely indicates that the versions incorporating transcription and navigation features, which the tech giant had announced to publicly test starting July last year, are no longer in works, reports 'The Verge'.

The information that the company has killed its plans for Project Iris was first reported by Insider.

Instead of AR glasses, the company is now focused on software.

The company is developing a ""micro XR"" platform that could be licensed to other headset manufacturers, similar to how Google offers the Android operating system to a broad ecosystem of phones.

However, the ski goggle-like headset is still in work as Google is no longer creating them all by itself, the report said.

In February this year, Samsung Electronics (KS: ), Google and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) had announced their partnership to build an ecosystem for extended reality (XR).

2022-06-27, IANS,India-US partnership to turbocharge innovation in emerging tech: Rajeev Chandrasekhar (IANS Interview),https://in.investing.com/news/indiaus-partnership-to-turbocharge-innovation-in-emerging-tech-rajeev-chandrasekhar-ians-interview-3700662,"New Delhi, June 27 (IANS) The tech sector partnership between India and the US, announced last week during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s historic state visit, will turbocharge tech ecosystems in both the countries, accelerating the pace of innovation in critical emerging technologies for mutual and global benefit, says Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT.In an interaction with IANS, the Minister said the tech sector partnership -- starting with an MoU in the critical and emerging technologies -- is tectonic and historical.

“This cooperation and partnership between India and US will certainly shape the future of tech in general and, in particular, the emerging technologies of OpenRAN wireless networks, semiconductors, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and quantum,” said Chandrasekhar.

During the visit, US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed the inauguration of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in January 2022 as a major milestone in US-India relations, calling on governments, businesses, and academic institutions to realise their shared vision for the strategic technology partnership.

The leaders recommitted the US and India to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual confidence and trust that reinforces our shared values and democratic institutions.

According to Chandrasekhar, the critical emerging technologies will shape the future of technology and economies in very deep and tectonic ways and will certainly impact lives of consumers and enterprises all over the world.

“The technology and innovation ecosystem has really come a long way in the last 9 years and today, there is no space of tech and emerging tech that India and Indian enterprises are not present in. PM Modi’s ‘Digital India’ vision, way back in 2015, was prescient and he foresaw the deep impact of technology on peoples’ lives and opportunities for our youth,” the Minister told IANS.

Alphabet and Google (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai, after meeting Prime Minister Modi in Washington, D.C., referred to his vision of ‘Digital India’ as way ahead of its time that other countries were following it now.

In the last nine years, Prime Minister Modi’s policies have resulted in creating a vibrant internet and ConsumerTech (D2C) innovation ecosystem, an India AI programme with Digital India Bhashini (a language translation model at its core), electronics and semiconductor ecosystem that is rapidly growing, high-performance computing platforms and a multi thousand crore quantum Mission, wireless technologies programme with 5G/6G etc.

Biden and Prime Minister Modi also hailed the signing of an MoU on semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership as a significant step in the coordination of semiconductor incentive programmes between the two nations.

This will promote commercial opportunities, research, talent, and skill development.

“The curriculum changes in our higher education system are underway to ensure high-quality talent for all these areas where the world seeks talent,” said the Minister.

Rapid digitalisation, demographics and changing global supply chains are the three trends that represent a big unprecedented opportunity for India and Indian youth.

“We are certainly in the most exciting period in India’s modern history, thanks to the hard work, effort and vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Chandrasekhar noted.

The report examined Chingari’s pivot to “18+ content with paid live 1-on-1 calls between creators and users”.

The report also saw recruitment posts for creators with promises of big payouts, in addition to several social media ads and videos featuring salacious promises to users.

In a statement, the company said that Chingari Private Call is a feature of Chingari that allows users to interact 1:1 using video mode.

“It's interactive, enabling viewers to comment, ask questions, and send virtual gifts during the stream. It enabled creators to monetize their time. The claim of “Chingari’s pivot paid live 1-on-1 calls between creators and users' is baseless,” the platform added.

“Chingari private call is just one of the features of this app. So to infer, Chingari in no way has pivoted to only this feature. Moreover, this feature was introduced because no other legacy platform allows users to directly talk to their favourite creators,” the platform further argued.

To check any NSFW content, said the company, it has a robust AI-based model and “have a team of moderators who keep an eye on such content”.

“We at Chingari take the concern around NSFW content very seriously. Being a community-driven platform, we are open to feedback and suggestions,” it added.

According to the Inc42 report, after it questioned Chingari about its new feature and monetisation model, “the company even changed its Android app’s parental rating on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store to 18+ this week (June 22, 2022), even though the personal video call feature was introduced in April”.

“YouTube is internally testing a product for playing online games, according to an email sent to employees at parent company Google (NASDAQ: ),” the report said. It signals Google’s ambitions to move beyond video hosting into games that can easily be played and shared between users, it added.

YouTube, which has billions of monthly users, is already a popular destination for gamers. The new gaming offering would feature arcade-style games like Stack Bounce, where players use a bouncing ball to smash through layers of bricks.

A company spokesperson said that gaming has long been a focus at YouTube. “We’re always experimenting with new features but have nothing to announce right now,” the spokesperson added.

The gaming experiment on YouTube comes as Google shut down its Cloud gaming service called Stadia early this year, after it failed to gain traction with users.

It is also planning to introduce an AI-powered “search” feature for its e-commerce.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is spending $100 million on a solution to compete with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the field of generative AI. Supposedly, the planned AWS Generative AI Innovation Centre would serve as a conduit between Amazon’s AI and machine learning specialists and customers who want to develop cutting-edge software.

Generative AI is the use of algorithms to generate original media including music, software, art, writing, simulations, and videos. Highspot, Twilio, Ryanair, and Lonely Planet are among the companies Amazon has named as early users of the innovation center. Despite rising competition in the cloud infrastructure industry, the firm plans to increase cloud service sales with the help of its new center.

AI-powered Search Feature

Enterprise expenditure on cloud solutions hit $63 billion globally in the first quarter of 2022, up 20% from the same quarter the previous year, according to a new survey comparing the largest cloud services providers conducted by Synergy Research Group.

Microsoft and Google’s year-over-year growth rates were the highest, with 23% and 10%, respectively, of the global market share. Amazon, the industry frontrunner, maintained its 32% Q1 market share.

Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, an AI tool that enables users to construct their own ChatGPT-like models, as part of its aim to compete with large tech firms. Titan (NS: ), which will be released soon, will have two new core models created by Amazon ML.

Recent job postings on LinkedIn for AI developers suggest that Amazon is also planning to introduce an AI-powered “search” feature for their e-commerce website, perhaps using a user experience similar to ChatGPT.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tesla downgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $248.00 (from $185.00) following a massive rally (up 108% YTD) in the EV maker's stock. Shares fell nearly 2% premarket today.

According to the firm, its view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets, is now better reflected in the stock. While the rating change was mostly driven by valuation, the bank also noted a difficult pricing environment for new vehicles, which it believes will hurt Tesla’s non-GAAP gross margin in 2022.

This represents the fourth downgrade this month for Tesla.

UBS downgraded Alphabet , sees better risk-reward in Meta and Amazon

UBS downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $132.00 (from $123.00), as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

The firm’s decision to move to the sidelines is based on several factors. These include limited upside potential to the current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates, medium-term revenue risk, the possibility of operating income margin expansion being offset by GenAI investments, and the perception of better risk-reward opportunities in other stocks, specifically Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ).

2 more downgrades

Celanese (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after BMO Capital downgraded the company to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $119.00 from $133.00 as end market weakness is likely to persist.

Viatris (NASDAQ: ) shares fell nearly 3% on Friday after Barclays downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $11.00.

The analysts highlight 4 key reasons why he is moving to the sidelines:

Limited upside to current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates; Medium-term revenue risk; Operating income margin expansion could be offset by GenAI investments; and Better risk-reward in other stocks, namely Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

On the competition front, the analysts still don’t see Bing or ChatGPT as “major threats” given the superiority of Search.

“We see some tail risk that Meta's AI chat could gain traction given the scale of users across its apps but we view this as more speculative. Our original concerns around the cost of GenAI have moderated, though near-term risk remains and the co did increase capex guidance last quarter and flagged a mix skew towards (faster depreciating) technical infrastructure. As such, while we view both the cost and competitive risks as less severe, some element of these risks remain,” they said in a note.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Friday during his three-day state visit to the US, Pichai made the announcement, saying that the company will continue to invest in India through its $10 billion digitisation fund.

In 2020, Google had announced to invest a whopping $10 billion in the country through its India Digitisation Fund over the next five to seven years.

""Today we are announcing the opening of our global fintech operations centre in GIFT City, Gujarat. It will cement India's fintech leadership, thanks to UPI, and Aadhaar. We are going to build on that foundation and take it globally,"" Pichai said.

He said Prime Minister Modi's vision for Digital India was ahead of its time and ""I now see it as a blueprint that other countries are looking to do so"".

The Ministry of External Affairs said in a tweet that Modi interacted with Pichai and ""discussed measures like artificial intelligence, fintech and promoting research and development"".

They also discussed collaboration between Google and academic institutions in India to promote research and development, and skill development.

In December last year, Pichai visited India and pledged support for India's G20 Presidency.

""Look forward to continuing our strong partnership and supporting India's G20 Presidency to advance an open, connected internet that works for all,"" Pichai had tweeted after meeting Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi.

Praising the government's Digital India initiative, Pichai said that he is ""excited for India to share its experience with the world as it takes over the G20 Presidency in 2022"".

He added that the pace of technological change in India is ""extraordinary"" and there are several opportunities ahead.

Users can also turn off the video feed from other participants using the quick action on their video.

This can be helpful when users want to focus their meeting view on just the presenter or hide participants with distracting video feeds. Moreover, the feature does not have admin control, the company said.

Meanwhile, earlier this month, the tech giant was rolling out a new viewer mode in the video communication service, which allows users to select ""Everyone is a viewer"" when creating their Calendar invite.

When using Google Meet for large meetings, designating attendees as ""viewers"" helps reduce potential meeting distractions, like audio disruptions.

Back to the fundamentals, Bernstein is still positive on the digital ad spend recovery. Still, the analysts highlight few headwinds facing Google.

“While the headlines are AI-focused, we see increasing competition from retail media, share-shift back to Meta, and yes, some Gen AI pressure capping near-term search growth,” the analysts added.

2022-06-27, IANS,DeepMind's next AI system to eclipse OpenAI's ChatGPT,https://in.investing.com/news/deepminds-next-ai-system-to-eclipse-openais-chatgpt-3700828,"San Francisco, June 27 (IANS) DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has said that google-owned artificial intelligence (AI) company is working on a new AI system named ‘Gemini’ which will be more capable than that behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT. According to Hassabis, the engineers are using techniques from the AI programme AlphaGo -- which was the first to defeat a champion human player of the board game Go -- to make Gemini, reports Wired.

Gemini is still in development and is a large language model (LLM) that works with text and is similar to GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT.

“At a high level you can think of Gemini as combining some of the strengths of AlphaGo-type systems with the amazing language capabilities of the large models,” Hassabis said.

“We also have some new innovations that are going to be pretty interesting.”

This new AI system was first teased at Google (NASDAQ: )'s developer conference last month, when the company announced the new AI projects.

Gemini is still being developed, which will take several months, according to Hassabis.

Moreover, it could cost tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had said in April that creating GPT-4 cost more than $100 million.

""When Gemini is complete it could play a major role in Google’s response to the competitive threat posed by ChatGPT and other generative AI technology,"" the report said.

""In 2014, DeepMind was acquired by Google after demonstrating striking results from software that used reinforcement learning to master simple video games,"" it added.

2022-06-27, IANS,India-US partnership to turbocharge innovation in emerging tech: Rajeev Chandrasekhar (IANS Interview),https://in.investing.com/news/indiaus-partnership-to-turbocharge-innovation-in-emerging-tech-rajeev-chandrasekhar-ians-interview-3700662,"New Delhi, June 27 (IANS) The tech sector partnership between India and the US, announced last week during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s historic state visit, will turbocharge tech ecosystems in both the countries, accelerating the pace of innovation in critical emerging technologies for mutual and global benefit, says Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Union Minister of State for Electronics and IT.In an interaction with IANS, the Minister said the tech sector partnership -- starting with an MoU in the critical and emerging technologies -- is tectonic and historical.

“This cooperation and partnership between India and US will certainly shape the future of tech in general and, in particular, the emerging technologies of OpenRAN wireless networks, semiconductors, high-performance computing, artificial intelligence and quantum,” said Chandrasekhar.

During the visit, US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Modi hailed the inauguration of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) in January 2022 as a major milestone in US-India relations, calling on governments, businesses, and academic institutions to realise their shared vision for the strategic technology partnership.

The leaders recommitted the US and India to fostering an open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystem, based on mutual confidence and trust that reinforces our shared values and democratic institutions.

According to Chandrasekhar, the critical emerging technologies will shape the future of technology and economies in very deep and tectonic ways and will certainly impact lives of consumers and enterprises all over the world.

“The technology and innovation ecosystem has really come a long way in the last 9 years and today, there is no space of tech and emerging tech that India and Indian enterprises are not present in. PM Modi’s ‘Digital India’ vision, way back in 2015, was prescient and he foresaw the deep impact of technology on peoples’ lives and opportunities for our youth,” the Minister told IANS.

Alphabet and Google (NASDAQ: ) CEO Sundar Pichai, after meeting Prime Minister Modi in Washington, D.C., referred to his vision of ‘Digital India’ as way ahead of its time that other countries were following it now.

In the last nine years, Prime Minister Modi’s policies have resulted in creating a vibrant internet and ConsumerTech (D2C) innovation ecosystem, an India AI programme with Digital India Bhashini (a language translation model at its core), electronics and semiconductor ecosystem that is rapidly growing, high-performance computing platforms and a multi thousand crore quantum Mission, wireless technologies programme with 5G/6G etc.

Biden and Prime Minister Modi also hailed the signing of an MoU on semiconductor supply chain and innovation partnership as a significant step in the coordination of semiconductor incentive programmes between the two nations.

This will promote commercial opportunities, research, talent, and skill development.

“The curriculum changes in our higher education system are underway to ensure high-quality talent for all these areas where the world seeks talent,” said the Minister.

Rapid digitalisation, demographics and changing global supply chains are the three trends that represent a big unprecedented opportunity for India and Indian youth.

“We are certainly in the most exciting period in India’s modern history, thanks to the hard work, effort and vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Chandrasekhar noted.

The report examined Chingari’s pivot to “18+ content with paid live 1-on-1 calls between creators and users”.

The report also saw recruitment posts for creators with promises of big payouts, in addition to several social media ads and videos featuring salacious promises to users.

In a statement, the company said that Chingari Private Call is a feature of Chingari that allows users to interact 1:1 using video mode.

“It's interactive, enabling viewers to comment, ask questions, and send virtual gifts during the stream. It enabled creators to monetize their time. The claim of “Chingari’s pivot paid live 1-on-1 calls between creators and users' is baseless,” the platform added.

“Chingari private call is just one of the features of this app. So to infer, Chingari in no way has pivoted to only this feature. Moreover, this feature was introduced because no other legacy platform allows users to directly talk to their favourite creators,” the platform further argued.

To check any NSFW content, said the company, it has a robust AI-based model and “have a team of moderators who keep an eye on such content”.

“We at Chingari take the concern around NSFW content very seriously. Being a community-driven platform, we are open to feedback and suggestions,” it added.

According to the Inc42 report, after it questioned Chingari about its new feature and monetisation model, “the company even changed its Android app’s parental rating on the Google (NASDAQ: ) Play Store to 18+ this week (June 22, 2022), even though the personal video call feature was introduced in April”.

“YouTube is internally testing a product for playing online games, according to an email sent to employees at parent company Google (NASDAQ: ),” the report said. It signals Google’s ambitions to move beyond video hosting into games that can easily be played and shared between users, it added.

YouTube, which has billions of monthly users, is already a popular destination for gamers. The new gaming offering would feature arcade-style games like Stack Bounce, where players use a bouncing ball to smash through layers of bricks.

A company spokesperson said that gaming has long been a focus at YouTube. “We’re always experimenting with new features but have nothing to announce right now,” the spokesperson added.

The gaming experiment on YouTube comes as Google shut down its Cloud gaming service called Stadia early this year, after it failed to gain traction with users.

It is also planning to introduce an AI-powered “search” feature for its e-commerce.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is spending $100 million on a solution to compete with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Google (NASDAQ: ) in the field of generative AI. Supposedly, the planned AWS Generative AI Innovation Centre would serve as a conduit between Amazon’s AI and machine learning specialists and customers who want to develop cutting-edge software.

Generative AI is the use of algorithms to generate original media including music, software, art, writing, simulations, and videos. Highspot, Twilio, Ryanair, and Lonely Planet are among the companies Amazon has named as early users of the innovation center. Despite rising competition in the cloud infrastructure industry, the firm plans to increase cloud service sales with the help of its new center.

AI-powered Search Feature

Enterprise expenditure on cloud solutions hit $63 billion globally in the first quarter of 2022, up 20% from the same quarter the previous year, according to a new survey comparing the largest cloud services providers conducted by Synergy Research Group.

Microsoft and Google’s year-over-year growth rates were the highest, with 23% and 10%, respectively, of the global market share. Amazon, the industry frontrunner, maintained its 32% Q1 market share.

Amazon recently introduced Bedrock, an AI tool that enables users to construct their own ChatGPT-like models, as part of its aim to compete with large tech firms. Titan (NS: ), which will be released soon, will have two new core models created by Amazon ML.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline.

Tesla downgraded at Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs downgraded Tesla (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $248.00 (from $185.00) following a massive rally (up 108% YTD) in the EV maker's stock. Shares fell nearly 2% premarket today.

According to the firm, its view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets, is now better reflected in the stock. While the rating change was mostly driven by valuation, the bank also noted a difficult pricing environment for new vehicles, which it believes will hurt Tesla’s non-GAAP gross margin in 2022.

This represents the fourth downgrade this month for Tesla.

UBS downgraded Alphabet , sees better risk-reward in Meta and Amazon

UBS downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $132.00 (from $123.00), as reported in real time on InvestingPro.

The firm’s decision to move to the sidelines is based on several factors. These include limited upside potential to the current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates, medium-term revenue risk, the possibility of operating income margin expansion being offset by GenAI investments, and the perception of better risk-reward opportunities in other stocks, specifically Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ).

2 more downgrades

Celanese (NYSE: ) shares fell more than 2% premarket today after BMO Capital downgraded the company to Market Perform from Outperform and cut its price target to $119.00 from $133.00 as end market weakness is likely to persist.

Viatris (NASDAQ: ) shares fell nearly 3% on Friday after Barclays downgraded the company to Underweight from Equalweight with a price target of $11.00.

The analysts highlight 4 key reasons why he is moving to the sidelines:

Limited upside to current high-single-digit Sites growth estimates; Medium-term revenue risk; Operating income margin expansion could be offset by GenAI investments; and Better risk-reward in other stocks, namely Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

On the competition front, the analysts still don’t see Bing or ChatGPT as “major threats” given the superiority of Search.

“We see some tail risk that Meta's AI chat could gain traction given the scale of users across its apps but we view this as more speculative. Our original concerns around the cost of GenAI have moderated, though near-term risk remains and the co did increase capex guidance last quarter and flagged a mix skew towards (faster depreciating) technical infrastructure. As such, while we view both the cost and competitive risks as less severe, some element of these risks remain,” they said in a note.

After meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Friday during his three-day state visit to the US, Pichai made the announcement, saying that the company will continue to invest in India through its $10 billion digitisation fund.

In 2020, Google had announced to invest a whopping $10 billion in the country through its India Digitisation Fund over the next five to seven years.

""Today we are announcing the opening of our global fintech operations centre in GIFT City, Gujarat. It will cement India's fintech leadership, thanks to UPI, and Aadhaar. We are going to build on that foundation and take it globally,"" Pichai said.

He said Prime Minister Modi's vision for Digital India was ahead of its time and ""I now see it as a blueprint that other countries are looking to do so"".

The Ministry of External Affairs said in a tweet that Modi interacted with Pichai and ""discussed measures like artificial intelligence, fintech and promoting research and development"".

They also discussed collaboration between Google and academic institutions in India to promote research and development, and skill development.

In December last year, Pichai visited India and pledged support for India's G20 Presidency.

""Look forward to continuing our strong partnership and supporting India's G20 Presidency to advance an open, connected internet that works for all,"" Pichai had tweeted after meeting Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi.

Praising the government's Digital India initiative, Pichai said that he is ""excited for India to share its experience with the world as it takes over the G20 Presidency in 2022"".

He added that the pace of technological change in India is ""extraordinary"" and there are several opportunities ahead.

The Prime Minister said on Friday that this was the clear message from the technology handshake event at the White House earlier in the day in which he and President Joe Biden met leading CEOs from the US and India, which included Google (NASDAQ: )'s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Alt (of ChatGPT fame), FMC Corporation (NYSE: )'s Mark Douglas on the American side, and Reliance (NS: )'s Mukesh Ambani and Mahindra's Anand Mahindra.

The event sent a clear message to the companies, the businesses, the manufacturers, the innovators of both countries, and that message is: ""This is the moment. This is the moment. The governments of India and America have done the groundwork for you all. You know, like you plough the field, we've done that. And whatever else is needed further we will keep doing it for you all. However, it is now your responsibility to wholeheartedly play, wholeheartedly thrive.""

""And the one that plays is the one that thrives,"" he added.

Modi was addressing attendees at an event organised at the iconic Kennedy Centre here by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, an advocacy group promoting ties between the two countries.

On the stage with Modi were Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- their second meeting after the US State Department lunch for the visiting leader -- and John Chambers, who is chairman of the USISPF and Chairman emeritus of Cisco (NASDAQ: ).

Modi pressed on with the hard sell, telling business leaders in the audience that they should not let go of this opportunity.

""I assure you that you will find a better environment in India. The ease of doing business is a commitment of our government,"" he said to them.

The Prime Minister presented India as a reliable and trusted economic power and player, detailing how it came to the aid of the world during the worst crisis faced by the world in a century -- the Covid-19 epidemic.

""When the world needed medicines India enhanced its production and sent medicines to more than 150 countries,"" he said, and added, ""When the world needed coronavirus vaccines, India increased its production and sent vaccines to more than 100 countries.""

In conclusion, Modi said, ""I, once again, invite you all to move forward together in this development journey of India. And I had once said this in my speech from the Red Fort, and I said. That this is the time. And this is the right time.""

Investing.com -- The Dow closed lower Wednesday as investors continued to hit pause on tech after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell talked up the need to resume rate hikes later this year.

The fell 0.3%, or 102 points, the fell 1.2%, and the fell 0.5%.

Powell Makes Hawkish Play

The Fed’s projections, released last week, calling for a further two rate hikes this year are a “pretty good guess” for the path of monetary policy should inflation continue to trend above the Fed’s 2% target, Powell said in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.

Powell is set to deliver his second day of testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The hawkish comments contrasted with that of other fed members including Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Atlantic Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic, both of whom towed a more cautious line on the need to rapidly return to rate hikes.

Bostic warned of that pressing on with additional rate hikes could “needlessly drain too much momentum from the economy.” While Goolsbee said he was still undecided on whether to resume hikes next month.

Tech Rally on Pause, Tesla Gets Downgrade

As sentiment on stocks wavered, big tech felt the brunt of the pressure with Google (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) leading to the downside.

In a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, Google accused Microsoft of anti-competitive practice in the cloud-computing market, alleging that the latter uses unfair licensing terms to lock customers into its Azure cloud business.

But while the Fed chief is unlikely to offer fresh clues on future monetary policy, many expect him as well as other Fed officials due to speak this week to point to still high inflation and reiterate the need to resume hiking rates.

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) was embroiled in legal trouble after the FTC sued the e-commerce giant for allegedly tricking customers into signing up for its Prime services without their consent.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 5% after Barclays downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy, on worries that the EV maker could be set to make further price cuts, hurting its margin and earnings.

Energy Rebounds, FedEx Fails to Impress

Energy, meanwhile, shook off the recent malaise and was one of the best performing sectors on the day as oil prices rebounded.

Baker Hughes Co (NASDAQ: ), APA Corporation (NASDAQ: ), and were among the biggest gainers in the sector.

On the earnings front, FedEx Corporation (NYSE: ) fell nearly 3% after delivering fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates and somewhat underwhelming guidance.

Back in Demand Amid Spot ETF Fever

Crypto-related stocks including Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: ), MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: ) and Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: ) were in rally mode after bitcoin briefly surged to over $30,000, a more than one-year high on growing hopes on the prospect of a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, or ETF.

The Prime Minister said on Friday that this was the clear message from the technology handshake event at the White House earlier in the day in which he and President Joe Biden met leading CEOs from the US and India, which included Google (NASDAQ: )'s Sundar Pichai, Microsoft (NASDAQ: )'s Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Alt (of ChatGPT fame), FMC Corporation (NYSE: )'s Mark Douglas on the American side, and Reliance (NS: )'s Mukesh Ambani and Mahindra's Anand Mahindra.

The event sent a clear message to the companies, the businesses, the manufacturers, the innovators of both countries, and that message is: ""This is the moment. This is the moment. The governments of India and America have done the groundwork for you all. You know, like you plough the field, we've done that. And whatever else is needed further we will keep doing it for you all. However, it is now your responsibility to wholeheartedly play, wholeheartedly thrive.""

""And the one that plays is the one that thrives,"" he added.

Modi was addressing attendees at an event organised at the iconic Kennedy Centre here by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, an advocacy group promoting ties between the two countries.

On the stage with Modi were Secretary of State Antony Blinken -- their second meeting after the US State Department lunch for the visiting leader -- and John Chambers, who is chairman of the USISPF and Chairman emeritus of Cisco (NASDAQ: ).

Modi pressed on with the hard sell, telling business leaders in the audience that they should not let go of this opportunity.

""I assure you that you will find a better environment in India. The ease of doing business is a commitment of our government,"" he said to them.

The Prime Minister presented India as a reliable and trusted economic power and player, detailing how it came to the aid of the world during the worst crisis faced by the world in a century -- the Covid-19 epidemic.

""When the world needed medicines India enhanced its production and sent medicines to more than 150 countries,"" he said, and added, ""When the world needed coronavirus vaccines, India increased its production and sent vaccines to more than 100 countries.""

In conclusion, Modi said, ""I, once again, invite you all to move forward together in this development journey of India. And I had once said this in my speech from the Red Fort, and I said. That this is the time. And this is the right time.""

Reports say that Tate holds BTC in huge comparatively.

On June 20, 2022, Tuesday, Romanian prosecutors caught Andrew Tate and raised an indictment for his illegal activities including rape and trafficking. Furthermore, the court has seized some of his possessions such as fifteen luxury cars, fourteen watches, and 21 (BTC) worth $560,000 respectively.

Moreover, Tate has been kept under house arrest during the month of December 2022 for investigation. Apparently, as per the recent press release, the prosecutors of the Directorate for the Investigation of Organized Crime and Terrorism defended to charge. The crimes of Tate are listed under the referral act which includes money laundering, human trafficking, illegal influencing, possessing perpetrator, and human life threats.

The case is processed to the Bucharest Court and effective measures have been taken for the house arrest of Tate and other citizens who are all defendants under this press release. Although the court order is released, it is with respect to the Code of Criminal Procedure followed by the investigation processes, and sharing the indictment without any defeat or concern of presumption.

Charges Seized from Andrew Tate

As mentioned above, the assets of Tate have been seized by Romanian prosecutors. Meanwhile, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) stated that the $300 million Bitcoin (BTC) is seized from Andrew Tate yet the issue lay with the Google (NASDAQ: ) translator. The false report from the BBC stunned the community and was altered to 21 BTC seize sooner.

Andrew Tate, the famous pervert and the late world kickboxing champion along with his brother Tristan who is in Romania, and the other two associates who are liable to his words have all been indicted. It is clearly mentioned that this group is involving women in sexual activities with false promises.

Case Details of Andrew Tate

There are several announcements that have been launched by the Office of Information and Public Relations within the Crime Investigation to the public regarding Andrew Tate.

Back in 2021, the four defendants including Tate is handed over to the Government for constituting a criminal offense. The crime details included rape in March and the illegal computer access of the victims in October.

Recent Updates on the Case

In 2022 March for consequent rape, the four defendants are prisoned under house arrest. Due to that accusations, the gang is trapped and the media team of Tate shared through the BBC:

“While this news is undoubtedly predictable, we embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation.”

Currently, the judge is considering the evidence presented to him/her within the time limit of 60 days. However, the case would prolong for years.

Tate Holding More BTCs

Later in May, Tate is creating engagement with the crypto coins. Like, he tweets the token ticker once it gets launched. This has engaged community enthusiasts to get the tagged coin and soon he claims ‘just joking’. This way, the coin pumps down as soon as it launches and trends in the market.

In 2022, Tate’s arrest was followed by the confiscation of 5 Bitcoin (BTC) valued at $100,000. Meanwhile, the total Bitcoin possessions reported sixteen in the count of value $465K. Now, as per the court, the complete possession of Tate’s BTC is seized."

The lawsuit seeks to restore competition in the digital advertising marketplace and end Google’s monopoly, which will encourage investment in newsrooms and news content throughout the country.

As more Americans read the news online, publishers depend on digital advertising revenue to provide timely, cutting-edge reporting and content that communities across the country rely on. Google’s practices have depressed revenue and impacted local newsrooms adversely by monopolizing the markets for important software and technology products that publishers and advertisers use to buy and sell ad space.

Google controls 90% of the market for “publisher ad servers,” which publishers use to offer ad space for sale. Google also controls over 60% of the market for “ad exchanges,” which run auctions among advertisers bidding for ad space on publishers’ websites. Google controls the largest source of advertisers bidding on exchanges. For Gannett, 60% of all buyers come through Google. The result is Google unfairly controlling selling, buying, and the exchange that matches sellers and buyers – and manipulating all aspects of online advertising transactions.

“Google has monopolized market trading to their advantage and at the expense of publishers, readers and everyone else. Digital advertising is the lifeblood of the online economy. Without free and fair competition for digital ad space, publishers cannot invest in their newsrooms,” said Michael Reed, Gannett Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “For more than a hundred years, Gannett has been a tireless advocate for freedom of the press empowering communities to thrive. This lawsuit seeks to ensure we can continue our mission for hundreds of years more.""

In 2022, Google made upwards of $30 billion in revenue from the sale of ad space on publishers’ websites which was six times the digital advertising revenue of all U.S. news publications, combined.

In December 2020, a bipartisan group of 17 State Attorneys General filed a lawsuit against Google raising similar allegations of ad-tech monopolization. The U.S. Department of Justice, joined by a bipartisan coalition of 17 additional States, filed its own ad-tech lawsuit against Google earlier this year. Both lawsuits have withstood Google’s best efforts to get the cases dismissed. And, last week, the European Union’s competition authority filed a related ad-tech case based on the same underlying conduct. The DOJ and EU are rightly seeking a breakup of Google’s ad-tech business, in addition to monetary damages and fines.
