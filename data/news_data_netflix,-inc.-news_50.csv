NFLX shares are trading around the $488 mark at the time of writing.

Analysts at the investment bank cited the Overweight-rated company's ""attractive risk/reward,"" its increased confidence in Netflix's return on content spending, execution on growth initiatives, including paid sharing and advertising, and the pull-back in competitive intensity in broader Media.

Morgan Stanley also noted that Netflix has begun hedging currency, which it expects will lift earnings, although they note that the impact of FX moves will be delayed in reported results.

""We continue to see NFLX shares as offering an attractive risk/reward as we raise our estimates and PT to $550, which implies shares trade at 26x our 2025E EPS, as we continue to forecast a 25-30% EPS CAGR over the next four years,"" said the investment bank.

""Our earnings outlook has increased on the stronger USD since our October upgrade. There is a high 70-80% flow-through of FX moves to EBIT given the cost base of Netflix,"" they added.

Furthermore, Morgan Stanley said it is raising its net adds forecast for Netflix ""modestly"" in 2024 and beyond, as they see the combined benefits of original programming strength and competitive withdrawal benefiting member growth at Netflix.

The investment bank believes Netflix's ""unmatched scale"" and FCF generation opens up new opportunities for the business, noting that the streaming giant is two years into its gaming investments and ""the benefits of these investments have yet to be material but offer upside in the future."" At the same time, the company is also ""increasingly able to optimize its content spending with new options around licensing."""

Investing.com -- Main U.S. indexes climbed ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve’s final policy meeting of the year, where it is expected to leave rates unchanged. Focus will also be Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments after the policy announcement.

Here are some of the biggest U.S. stock movers today:

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 2.2% after the streaming giant released viewership figures across its catalog, responding to criticism over its perceived lack of transparency over how its titles are consumed.

Pfizer (NYSE: ) stock slumped 8% after the drugmaker forecast 2024 revenue and profit below expectations, even as it raised cost-cut target by $500 million.

Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) stock fell 5.7% after the budget airline raised its forecast for fourth-quarter fuel costs, even while expecting unit revenue for the quarter to improve to the higher end of its previous guidance range on the back of strong leisure demand.

Airbnb (ABNB) stock rose 0.25% after the vacation rental platform agreed to pay over $600 million to the Italian Revenue Agency to settle outstanding host income tax obligations for the 2017-2021 tax years.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) stock fell 2.7% as the electric vehicle manufacturer is set to lose up to $7,500 federal tax credit for some Model 3 vehicles. It also filed a recall of 2 million vehicles to fix autopilot flaws.

Take-Two (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 3%, with the video-game maker set to be included in the , effective Dec 18, likely boosting demand from investors.

Photronics (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 15.6% after the semiconductor photomask manufacturer beat quarterly expectations, with revenue up 8.2% year on year. It also expects next quarter's revenue to be around $221 million, in line with estimates.

Vertex Pharma (NASDAQ: ) climbed 10.3% following positive results from a phase 2 study of VX-548 for the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Since launching our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists in 2021, Netflix has provided more information about what people are watching than any other streamer except YouTube. And now we believe it’s time to go further.

Starting today we will publish What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report twice a year. This is a comprehensive report of what people watched on Netflix over a six month period1, including:

Hours viewed for every title — original and licensed — watched for over 50,000 hours2;

The premiere date3 for any Netflix TV series or film; and

Whether a title was available globally.

In total, this report covers more than 18,000 titles — representing 99% of all viewing on Netflix — and nearly 100 billion hours viewed.

Over 60% of Netflix titles released between January and June 2022 appeared on our weekly Top 10 lists. So while this report is broader in scope, the trends reflected in it are very similar to those in the Top 10 lists, including:

The strength of returning favorites like Ginny & Georgia, Alice in Borderland, The Marked Heart, Outer Banks, You, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, XO Kitty and film sequels Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2;

The popularity of new series like The Night Agent, The Diplomat, Beef, The Glory, Alpha Males, FUBAR and Fake Profile, which generate huge audiences and fandoms;

The size of the audience of our films across every genre including The Mother, Luther: The Fallen Sun, You People, AKA, ¡Que viva México! and Hunger;

The enthusiasm for non-English stories, which generated 30% of all viewing;

The staying power of titles on Netflix, which extends well beyond their premieres. All Quiet on the Western Front, for example, debuted in October 2022 and generated 80M hours viewed between January and June; and

The demand for older, licensed titles, which generates tremendous value for our members and for rights holders.

When reading the report it’s important to remember:

Success on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone. We have enormously successful movies and TV shows with both lower and higher hours viewed. It’s all about whether a movie or TV show thrilled its audience — and the size of that audience relative to the economics of the title; and

To compare between titles it’s best to use our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists, which take into account run times and premiere dates.

This is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry. We believe the viewing information in this report — combined with our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists — will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them.

This decline stood in sharp contrast to the positive momentum seen in major tech companies, where Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). saw a 2.11% increase to $193.42, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). rose by 1.41% to $146.88. Meanwhile, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: ) saw a modest uptick of 0.28%, ending the day at $455.15.

Despite the gains in the tech sector, broader market indices reflected a different story with both the S&P 500 and experiencing slight declines for the day, dropping 0.06% and 0.22% respectively.

The dip in Fox's share price marks a significant deviation from its February peak, now trailing by $7.78. Notably, the trading volume for Fox reached around 5 million shares, which is higher than its typical trading activity, indicating increased investor attention.

Tuesday's mixed market performance highlights the diverging fortunes of companies within different sectors, with tech stocks showing resilience even as some media companies like Fox Corp face headwinds.

As we approach the end of 2022, the streaming giant continues to navigate through a rapidly evolving media landscape, with its stock performance and strategic decisions being closely watched by investors.

Market and Financial Performance

Analysts have pointed to Netflix's strong position in the streaming industry, supported by its vast content library and global reach. The company has been successful in leveraging the shift from linear TV to on-demand video consumption, a trend that is expected to persist. Despite a large market capitalization, which reflects its dominance, there are concerns regarding its future growth trajectory.

Financially, Netflix has shown resilience with projected revenue growth from $31,616 million in FY22 to $43,655 million by FY25. The earnings per share (EPS) are also expected to follow an upward trend, with estimates of significant growth by 2025. This financial health is further underscored by a robust free cash flow yield, which is anticipated to increase in the coming years.

Strategic Initiatives and Growth Drivers

Netflix's growth drivers have been multifaceted. Analysts have highlighted the company's Paid Sharing initiatives and ad-supported tier as key strategies for subscriber growth and revenue acceleration. The company's targeted price increases in key markets, along with a strong content slate, are expected to contribute positively to its financial performance.

The introduction of an advertising tier is seen as a potential game-changer for Netflix. It is expected to provide multi-year tailwinds, even though it's still in its early stages. The company's decision to grow operating margins more gradually, with an increase of 2% per year rather than the previously assumed 3%, reflects a cautious yet strategic approach to balance investment with profitability.

Competitive Landscape

Competition in the streaming space remains a concern, with Netflix facing off against other major players like Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video, Disney+, and HBO Max. While Netflix has maintained a leadership position, the competitive intensity has led to increased content costs and the need for continuous innovation to retain and grow its subscriber base.

Regulatory Environment and Customer Base

Regulatory challenges have not been extensively discussed, but they remain a backdrop against which Netflix operates, especially with its global presence. The company's customer base continues to diversify, with international markets offering significant opportunities for growth, particularly in regions with fewer in-home entertainment options.

Management and Strategy

Netflix's management has been proactive in navigating market dynamics, as evidenced by strategic plan adjustments and marketing initiatives. However, there have been concerns over leadership changes, particularly in the advertising division, which could signal internal challenges.

Potential Impacts of External Factors

Currency fluctuations have been a notable external factor affecting Netflix's revenue, with hedging programs planned to reduce volatility. The potential impact of Hollywood strikes on content production and the rollout of price increases also present risks that could affect subscriber growth and financial performance.

Upcoming Product Launches

The company's content slate, including anticipated releases, is expected to drive engagement and subscriber growth. High-profile releases have been a staple of Netflix's strategy to keep its content fresh and appealing to a broad audience.

Stock Performance

Netflix's stock has experienced volatility, with its performance compared to peers like Amazon and Disney being a focal point for investors. The company's share repurchase activity and price sensitivity among subscribers are factors that contribute to its stock dynamics.

Bear Case

Is Netflix's growth sustainable in the competitive streaming market?

Netflix's growth sustainability is under scrutiny due to market saturation signs and increased reliance on pricing strategies for revenue growth. The streaming engagement trends are reaching a point of maturity, and there is a risk that Netflix's premium valuation may not hold if growth expectations fall short, as suggested by Wolfe Research's downgrade. The firm's concerns about slower-than-expected adoption of ad-supported video on demand (AVOD), trade-downs indicated by ARM shortfalls, and management's signals of less margin expansion reflect the cautious stance on the company's ability to maintain its high valuation multiples.

Can Netflix overcome internal and external challenges to maintain profitability?

Internal challenges, such as turnover in leadership within the advertising division, and external factors like currency headwinds and production strikes, pose significant risks to Netflix's profitability. The company's decision to slow down margin growth and the potential impact from foreign exchange revenue headwinds anticipated in Q4 are bearish signals that could affect its financial health. Additionally, the potential loss of key content and risks associated with executing new monetization strategies such as advertising and paid sharing could hinder Netflix's ability to maintain profitability.

Bull Case

Will Netflix's strategic initiatives drive future revenue growth?

Analysts are optimistic about Netflix's strategic initiatives, including Paid Sharing and the ad-supported tier, which are expected to drive future revenue growth. The company's robust content slate and anticipation of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion support this bullish view. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: )'s analysis suggests that Netflix's strong execution and improving returns on content spend, along with a more attractive risk/reward profile, present significant upside potential compared to downside risks.

How will Netflix's market position and content spending influence its success?

Netflix's dominant position in streaming and high-engagement content production is anticipated to continue, bolstered by its large content budget of $17 billion annually. The policy changes regarding shared-account fees and the introduction of ad-supported services are expected to drive subscriber growth and diversify revenue streams. Despite increasing competition, Netflix's strategic content investments position it well to attract more subscribers globally and maintain its market leadership.

As the streaming industry continues to evolve, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: ) remains a subject of intense scrutiny among Wall Street analysts. The company, known for its vast library of TV shows, movies, anime, documentaries, and more, is navigating a landscape marked by shifting consumer preferences and intensifying competition. Investors are particularly keen on understanding the company's performance across different markets, the impact of its product segments, and its strategic initiatives.

Performance in Different Markets and Product Segments

Netflix's reach is truly global, with a strong presence in both developed and emerging markets. While the company faces challenges in highly penetrated markets such as the United States, it sees significant growth opportunities in international markets like Mexico, where it enjoys high satisfaction and penetration rates. Analysts note that the company's international growth is crucial, especially as the domestic market shows signs of saturation.

Competitive Landscape and Market Trends

The streaming giant is not without its competitors. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ: )'s Prime Video, Warner Bros. Discovery (NASDAQ: ), Comcast (NASDAQ: ), Disney, and ViacomCBS (NASDAQ: ) are all vying for a piece of the pie. Despite this, Netflix's large content budget, which allows for significant investment in proprietary content, positions it well to attract and retain subscribers globally.

Regulatory Environments and Customer Base

Regulatory challenges vary by region, but Netflix has managed to navigate these with relative success. Its customer base is diverse, spanning across different demographics, which is a testament to the broad appeal of its content offerings.

Management and Strategy

Netflix's management team has made strategic decisions to slow down margin growth, opting for a more gradual increase to allow for investment in advertising infrastructure and content. The company plans to grow operating margins more gradually, aiming for a 2% increase per year for 2024 and 2025.

Potential Impacts of External Factors

External factors such as the Hollywood strikes have been seen as negative for Netflix, but less so compared to other streamers and studios. Currency fluctuations have also impacted the company's financials, with plans to implement a hedging program in early 2024 to reduce volatility from international currency fluctuations.

Upcoming Product Launches

Netflix continues to innovate with new product launches. The introduction of ad-supported tiers and initiatives to monetize password sharing are seen as major growth drivers. The company's content slate remains strong, with significant titles set for release despite talent strikes.

Stock Performance

Netflix's stock performance has been a subject of mixed perspectives. While some firms maintain a bullish outlook based on the company's strong content and potential for advertising revenue, others have downgraded the stock due to concerns over slower-than-expected growth forecasts for 2024-25.

Analyst Outlooks and Reasonings

Analysts are generally optimistic about Netflix's strategic initiatives, particularly its ability to drive subscriber growth and average revenue per membership (ARM) through initiatives like password sharing rules and advertising.

Despite potential distortions in earnings, Meta is projected to maintain its growth trajectory. The company's lower price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, a metric that takes into account future growth estimates, signals a promising future. The tech giant is expected to bolster its growth by monetizing high-growth areas such as Reels and AI-powered business messaging.

Meanwhile, other FAANG stocks are also set for continued growth. Increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is anticipated to favor Amazon and Alphabet as organizations increasingly utilize their cloud platforms. Apple's investment in generative AI and potential profits from the self-driving car market could further enhance its performance.

Netflix, on the other hand, is banking on its ad-supported streaming model and gaming for future growth.

(AVGO) announced today that the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding that a Broadcom patent related to HEVC/H.265 video coding is valid. This opinion follows a September 19, 2022 judgment by the District Court of Munich that Netflix infringes this patent. The Munich Court also issued an injunction requiring Netflix to cease and desist all further infringement in Germany.

The European patent at issue, EP 2 575 366 (“`366 Patent”), covers key features of digital video processing often used in HEVC video coding. The Munich District Court ruled that Netflix infringes the `366 Patent through its transmission of HEVC video, which Netflix uses to provide Ultra HD content to its users.

Broadcom has filed a motion with the Munich Court seeking penalties for Netflix’s lack of compliance with the injunction. Under section 890 of the German Civil Procedure Code, penalties for violating the injunction include: (1) government fines of up to €250,000 for each act of infringement, such as each time Netflix sends an infringing video stream to a German subscriber; and/or (2) up to six month’s imprisonment for members of the infringer’s board of directors.

“Broadcom is pleased that the German courts continue to recognize its patented contributions to the video technology used by successful streaming services like Netflix,” said Mark Terrano, vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s Intellectual Property and Licensing Division.

Since 2018, Netflix and Broadcom have been engaged in a wide-ranging patent dispute in which Broadcom has accused Netflix of infringing numerous U.S., German, and Dutch patents through its provision of its video streaming service.

Despite the broader market downturn, shares of tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose last week. Amazon's shares increased by over 6% following positive investor sentiment towards its Q3 update and Q4 forecast. The positive sentiment towards Amazon led to a rise in shares for Microsoft and Apple as well, with Apple set to release its quarterly figures soon.

However, not all tech stocks fared well. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix Inc.

In addition, the platform launched the Top 10 so advertisers can target the most popular series and movies on Netflix. In a recent event, Netflix said the Top 10 feature was something that advertisers were keen on.

Looking to Q1 2024, Netflix said advertisers will be able to utilize the new binge ad (wt) format that ""taps into the viewing behavior of watching multiple episodes in a row."" It means that after watching three consecutive episodes, members will be presented with a fourth episode ad-free. Meanwhile, in early 2024, NFLX will launch the ability to ""showcase QR codes in advertising creative running on Netflix in the US.""

Netflix shares have jumped over 1% so far on Wednesday."

The also fell by over 366 points to close at 32,417.59. This market downturn, primarily due to soaring Treasury yields and various economic and geopolitical issues, has caused concern among Americans as it may impact the performance of numerous mutual funds that benchmark against these indices.

Despite the broader market downturn, shares of tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), and Apple (NASDAQ: ) rose last week. Amazon's shares increased by over 6% following positive investor sentiment towards its Q3 update and Q4 forecast. The positive sentiment towards Amazon led to a rise in shares for Microsoft and Apple as well, with Apple set to release its quarterly figures soon.

However, not all tech stocks fared well. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix Inc.

Netflix smashes Q3 expectations, raises prices

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares catapulted higher on Thursday after it reported far better Q3 earnings than anticipated and a healthy rise in subscribers, while also announcing it will hike prices on its streaming services.

The company's earnings of $3.73 per share was well above the $3.49 average analyst target, while $8.54 billion in sales was in line, and paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter - well above expectations for just over 6M.

The company acknowledged the ""challenging"" macro environment for the industry in the past six months due to the writers and actors strikes, and said it is ""committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible.""

Netflix said it sees Q4 EPS of $2.15, reversing from the prior year's loss of $0.47, and anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of around 11% to some $8.69B.

KeyBanc, Morgan Stanley, Truist and DZ Bank all upgraded the stock to buy-equivalent ratings on the news, with KeyBanc citing the company's ongoing success in paid sharing, its rising operating profit and free cash flow, and its estimate that share buybacks ""should support a 25%+ EPS growth profile.""

Morgan Stanley, for its part, said, “We believe Netflix will deliver the objectives it set out a year ago, accelerate revenue growth back to double digits and expand margins. At the same time, some of the froth in the stock and expectations have come out, creating a better entry point.""

And JPMorgan also hailed the company's paid sharing strategy, as well as a ""strong content slate"" and Q4's ""favorable seasonality.""

Netflix also said it will immediately raise rates on its basic and premium (non-ad-supported) plans in the US, UK and France. In the US, this will mean a $2 raise to $11.99 per month for basic, and a $3 hike to $22.99 for premium. It is keeping prices steady on ad-supported plans.

Netflix ended the week at $400.96, up 16% for the week and some 36% higher year to date

Nvidia dented by new US restrictions on chip exports to China

On the flip side, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shares slumped nearly 10% this past week amid the US government's decision to restrict export of advanced chips to China.

In a regulatory filing, Nvidia highlighted the possibility of export controls affecting its ability to complete product development in a timely manner. The company also said that these controls could potentially disrupt support for existing customers of affected products and their supply to regions impacted by these restrictions.

While these challenges are not expected to have an immediate financial impact, Nvidia may possibly need to relocate certain operations from one or more countries.

Analysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley lowered their Nvidia price targets in response.

Citi analysts kept their Buy rating on the stock but slashed the price target by $55 to $575, writing that they ""assume low likelihood of US government granting export licenses,"" and adding that they believe the new restrictions ""will make it difficult for NVIDIA to sell to China.""

They nevertheless remain bullish on Nvidia stock due to “secular AI growth which remains in early innings, in our view.”

Morgan Stanley likewise kept Nvidia's Overweight rating in place - as well as the stock's designation as a ""Top Pick in semis"" - but cut the price target by $30 to $600 as the announced export controls turned out “more draconian than our expectations.”

Tesla poor earnings, caution

Meanwhile, Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Q3 missed Wall Street estimates as its recent wave of electric vehicle (EV) price cuts weighed on margins, triggering a more-than-9% plunge in the shares Thursday.

Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.66 on revenue of $23.35B late Wednesday, making for its widest revenue miss in over three years. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $24.32B.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the quarter from 18.7% in Q2.

Shares on Thursday reversed Wednesday's after-hours gains after cautious commentary by CEO Elon Musk, who appeared to waver in his optimism after once calling Tesla ""recession-resilient.""

“I’m worried about the high interest rate environment we’re in,” he said on the call. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car.”

Musk also said he wants to ""temper expectations"" for Tesla's Cybertruck vehicle, adding, ""It’s a great product, but financially, it will take a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cashflow contributor.""

Ten Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets on the stock amid increased concern about Tesla's near-term outlook and its ability to maintain its exceptional expansion.

Goldman Sachs analysts, who lowered Tesla's price target by $30 to $235, wrote that they believe the Q3 report ""will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns."" And Citi analysts - who cut the price target by $16 to $255, along with their full-year EPS estimate on Tesla - said the Q3 results were worse than they had anticipated.

For the week, shares were off about 16% to Friday's close of $211.99. The stock has still booked a 96% gain for the year.

Flimsy China demand for Apple's new iPhone

Apple's (NASDAQ: ) new iPhone 15 is facing challenges in the Chinese market, according to Bloomberg, with sales there lagging behind those of its predecessor.

Market tracker Counterpoint Research estimates a 4.5% decline in iPhone 15 sales in China compared with those of the iPhone 14 in the first 17 days after release, while Jefferies analysts estimate a much steeper double-digit percentage shortfall.

These reports highlight the stumbling blocks Apple is encountering in China, where these sales are impacted by economic struggles and competition from companies like Huawei.

Counterpoint projects Huawei could sell 5M to 6M units of its Mate 60 Pro this year alone, numbers that could hit double digits in 2024 - and in fact, Jefferies says, Huawei has now taken the top spot in the market from Apple - a trend that ""suggests iPhone would lose to Huawei in 2024,"" the analysts wrote.

Apple shares slipped 3.3% for the week to $172.88.

ASML a new top pick at BofA despite soft guidance

ASML (NASDAQ: ) issued a cautionary outlook along with its report that orders had fallen below expectations, even as it maintains a robust outlook - a forecast that BofA analysts said was “the reset” they were looking for, with ASML now deemed a top pick at the firm.

The semiconductor-equipment maker warned of flat sales in the upcoming year as customers opt to conserve cash in the face of economic uncertainties, and net profit for the three months ended September 30 was 1.9 billion euros, in line with analysts' expectations, while net bookings came to €2.6B ($1 = €0.94) vs. Q3 sales of €6.7B.

Despite the cautious 2024 outlook, ASML maintains a robust order backlog of €35B, and the company expects a more favorable 2025, given its customers' expansion plans across Asia, the US, and Europe.

BofA, positive on this ""reset,"" added ASML to its list of Top EU SemiCap stocks to own: “The stock trades on 18x EV/EBITDA and 22x PER, which we consider highly attractive given the 21% EBITDA CAGR 2022-25E (PEG

Morgan Stanley added that the new guidance suggests ASML is taking a ""more conservative view"" on FY24, saying the company likely sees “revenues similar to FY23 and yet still see this year as pivotal to preparation for “significant” growth in 2025.""

Still, after the weak guidance, shares lost 3.5% Wednesday. The stock closed Friday at $547.10, down nearly 5% for the week.

The market turbulence was triggered by Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s failure to meet Wall Street's Q3 expectations and escalating Treasury yields, which reached a 16-year high. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, in his speech at the Economic Club of New York, hinted at further increases in the interest rate due to concerns about high inflation.

Despite the gloomy outlook, Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s stock rose over 16% due to nine million new Q3 users and American Airlines (NASDAQ: )' upbeat quarterly results. However, Tesla's shares plunged nearly 10% after its third quarter results missed Wall Street estimates. This led to widespread sectoral declines, including a 2.4% drop in the real estate sector, and losses in major indices like the , , and .

Powell's monetary policy discussion exacerbated investor fears of persistent high interest rates. He underscored the bank's determination to hit a 2% inflation target by closely observing data reflecting economic resilience and labor demand. This might necessitate sustained high-interest rates. Despite unemployment benefits hitting a nine-month low, indicating strength in the labor market, investor uncertainty remains high as reflected by the Market Volatility Index reaching its highest level since March.

On the other hand, the Reserve Bank of Australia faces a $43 billion deficit from COVID-19 stimulus measures, inciting debate over who should cover the bailout. Furthermore, releases of Japan's CPI data and UK retail sales figures are imminent.

The Fed Chair also reinforced his commitment to a 2% inflation target despite global uncertainties.

Powell pointed out that rising bond yields are assisting in tackling stubborn inflation but are also putting pressure on equities; ten-year U.S. Treasury yields reached 4.99%, their highest since July 2007. Despite these tensions and high bond yields, prices are surging towards $2,000 an ounce. Analysts note that gold's traditional negative correlation with bond yields has broken due to geopolitical unrest, potentially easing the Fed's pressure to hike rates.

Mike Archibald of AGF Investments commented on these tighter conditions but also suggested there's a likelihood the Fed might pause rate hikes due to consumer impact. He questioned how long these elevated rates would persist and predicted Powell's continued focus on controlling expectations and maintaining flexibility for possible future hikes.

Meanwhile, U.S. companies reported mixed Q3 earnings: Tesla (NASDAQ: ) saw weaker-than-expected results leading to a 9% drop in its stocks, while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) enjoyed stronger subscriber growth resulting in a 16% increase in its stocks.

The Canadian dollar traded at 72.91 cents against the amidst the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict that caused a surge in commodity prices, with oil nearing $90 per barrel and gold and prices seeing significant increases.

Looking ahead, the Bank of Canada is expected to make a similar rate decision next week. As concerns mount over U.S. debt and potential loss of yield curve control, gold's allure increases, possibly driving further yield increases and prompting the Fed's balance sheet expansion.

The stocks edged higher on Thursday, recovering a small portion of the losses experienced on Wednesday, as investors prepared for more comments from central bankers.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak in the Economic Club of New York later on Thursday with investors guessing if he will endorse remarks from other Fed officials over the last week, who are more dovish than hawkish, the Market Insider said.

Powell's speech comes as the 10-year US Treasury yield approaches 5 per cent.

The yield hit a high of 4.98 per cent on Thursday, it is highest since June 2007.

Investors are also digesting a slew of earnings reports from companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ: ), which missed analyst's profit and revenue estimates, and Netflix (NASDAQ: ), which beat expectations, the Insider said.

Of the 64 companies that reported earnings results so far, 73 per cent have beaten profit estimates by a median of 6 per cent, according to data from Fundstrat.

Tesla is on track to wipe out $40 billion in market value as its shares fell 6 per cent following Elon Musk's downbeat Cybertruck outlook.

But after the S&P 500 soared nearly 16 per cent in the first half of the year its a disappointment. Higher interest rates and bond yields hampered stocks in the late summer and early fall, culminating in a 4.9 per cent decline in September.

Despite the drop, Goldman Sachs is sticking with its mid-year price target of 4,500 for the S&P 500, which is about 6 per cent higher than current levels. Gradual earnings growth will drive the rally as multiples stay flat, according to David Kostin, the firm's chief US equity strategist.

Netflix smashes Q3 expectations, raises prices

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares catapulted higher on Thursday after it reported far better Q3 earnings than anticipated and a healthy rise in subscribers, while also announcing it will hike prices on its streaming services.

The company's earnings of $3.73 per share was well above the $3.49 average analyst target, while $8.54 billion in sales was in line, and paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter - well above expectations for just over 6M.

The company acknowledged the ""challenging"" macro environment for the industry in the past six months due to the writers and actors strikes, and said it is ""committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible.""

Netflix said it sees Q4 EPS of $2.15, reversing from the prior year's loss of $0.47, and anticipates year-over-year revenue growth of around 11% to some $8.69B.

KeyBanc, Morgan Stanley, Truist and DZ Bank all upgraded the stock to buy-equivalent ratings on the news, with KeyBanc citing the company's ongoing success in paid sharing, its rising operating profit and free cash flow, and its estimate that share buybacks ""should support a 25%+ EPS growth profile.""

Morgan Stanley, for its part, said, “We believe Netflix will deliver the objectives it set out a year ago, accelerate revenue growth back to double digits and expand margins. At the same time, some of the froth in the stock and expectations have come out, creating a better entry point.""

And JPMorgan also hailed the company's paid sharing strategy, as well as a ""strong content slate"" and Q4's ""favorable seasonality.""

Netflix also said it will immediately raise rates on its basic and premium (non-ad-supported) plans in the US, UK and France. In the US, this will mean a $2 raise to $11.99 per month for basic, and a $3 hike to $22.99 for premium. It is keeping prices steady on ad-supported plans.

Netflix ended the week at $400.96, up 16% for the week and some 36% higher year to date

Nvidia dented by new US restrictions on chip exports to China

On the flip side, Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shares slumped nearly 10% this past week amid the US government's decision to restrict export of advanced chips to China.

In a regulatory filing, Nvidia highlighted the possibility of export controls affecting its ability to complete product development in a timely manner. The company also said that these controls could potentially disrupt support for existing customers of affected products and their supply to regions impacted by these restrictions.

While these challenges are not expected to have an immediate financial impact, Nvidia may possibly need to relocate certain operations from one or more countries.

Analysts at Citi and Morgan Stanley lowered their Nvidia price targets in response.

Citi analysts kept their Buy rating on the stock but slashed the price target by $55 to $575, writing that they ""assume low likelihood of US government granting export licenses,"" and adding that they believe the new restrictions ""will make it difficult for NVIDIA to sell to China.""

They nevertheless remain bullish on Nvidia stock due to “secular AI growth which remains in early innings, in our view.”

Morgan Stanley likewise kept Nvidia's Overweight rating in place - as well as the stock's designation as a ""Top Pick in semis"" - but cut the price target by $30 to $600 as the announced export controls turned out “more draconian than our expectations.”

Tesla poor earnings, caution

Meanwhile, Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) Q3 missed Wall Street estimates as its recent wave of electric vehicle (EV) price cuts weighed on margins, triggering a more-than-9% plunge in the shares Thursday.

Tesla reported adjusted EPS of $0.66 on revenue of $23.35B late Wednesday, making for its widest revenue miss in over three years. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.73 on revenue of $24.32B.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the quarter from 18.7% in Q2.

Shares on Thursday reversed Wednesday's after-hours gains after cautious commentary by CEO Elon Musk, who appeared to waver in his optimism after once calling Tesla ""recession-resilient.""

“I’m worried about the high interest rate environment we’re in,” he said on the call. “If interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car.”

Musk also said he wants to ""temper expectations"" for Tesla's Cybertruck vehicle, adding, ""It’s a great product, but financially, it will take a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cashflow contributor.""

Ten Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets on the stock amid increased concern about Tesla's near-term outlook and its ability to maintain its exceptional expansion.

Goldman Sachs analysts, who lowered Tesla's price target by $30 to $235, wrote that they believe the Q3 report ""will add to near-to-intermediate term investor concerns."" And Citi analysts - who cut the price target by $16 to $255, along with their full-year EPS estimate on Tesla - said the Q3 results were worse than they had anticipated.

For the week, shares were off about 16% to Friday's close of $211.99. The stock has still booked a 96% gain for the year.

Flimsy China demand for Apple's new iPhone

Apple's (NASDAQ: ) new iPhone 15 is facing challenges in the Chinese market, according to Bloomberg, with sales there lagging behind those of its predecessor.

Market tracker Counterpoint Research estimates a 4.5% decline in iPhone 15 sales in China compared with those of the iPhone 14 in the first 17 days after release, while Jefferies analysts estimate a much steeper double-digit percentage shortfall.

These reports highlight the stumbling blocks Apple is encountering in China, where these sales are impacted by economic struggles and competition from companies like Huawei.

Counterpoint projects Huawei could sell 5M to 6M units of its Mate 60 Pro this year alone, numbers that could hit double digits in 2024 - and in fact, Jefferies says, Huawei has now taken the top spot in the market from Apple - a trend that ""suggests iPhone would lose to Huawei in 2024,"" the analysts wrote.

Apple shares slipped 3.3% for the week to $172.88.

ASML a new top pick at BofA despite soft guidance

ASML (NASDAQ: ) issued a cautionary outlook along with its report that orders had fallen below expectations, even as it maintains a robust outlook - a forecast that BofA analysts said was “the reset” they were looking for, with ASML now deemed a top pick at the firm.

The semiconductor-equipment maker warned of flat sales in the upcoming year as customers opt to conserve cash in the face of economic uncertainties, and net profit for the three months ended September 30 was 1.9 billion euros, in line with analysts' expectations, while net bookings came to €2.6B ($1 = €0.94) vs. Q3 sales of €6.7B.

Despite the cautious 2024 outlook, ASML maintains a robust order backlog of €35B, and the company expects a more favorable 2025, given its customers' expansion plans across Asia, the US, and Europe.

BofA, positive on this ""reset,"" added ASML to its list of Top EU SemiCap stocks to own: “The stock trades on 18x EV/EBITDA and 22x PER, which we consider highly attractive given the 21% EBITDA CAGR 2022-25E (PEG

Morgan Stanley added that the new guidance suggests ASML is taking a ""more conservative view"" on FY24, saying the company likely sees “revenues similar to FY23 and yet still see this year as pivotal to preparation for “significant” growth in 2025.""

Still, after the weak guidance, shares lost 3.5% Wednesday. The stock closed Friday at $547.10, down nearly 5% for the week.

The market turbulence was triggered by Tesla (NASDAQ: )'s failure to meet Wall Street's Q3 expectations and escalating Treasury yields, which reached a 16-year high. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, in his speech at the Economic Club of New York, hinted at further increases in the interest rate due to concerns about high inflation.

Despite the gloomy outlook, Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s stock rose over 16% due to nine million new Q3 users and American Airlines (NASDAQ: )' upbeat quarterly results. However, Tesla's shares plunged nearly 10% after its third quarter results missed Wall Street estimates. This led to widespread sectoral declines, including a 2.4% drop in the real estate sector, and losses in major indices like the , , and .

Powell's monetary policy discussion exacerbated investor fears of persistent high interest rates. He underscored the bank's determination to hit a 2% inflation target by closely observing data reflecting economic resilience and labor demand. This might necessitate sustained high-interest rates. Despite unemployment benefits hitting a nine-month low, indicating strength in the labor market, investor uncertainty remains high as reflected by the Market Volatility Index reaching its highest level since March.

On the other hand, the Reserve Bank of Australia faces a $43 billion deficit from COVID-19 stimulus measures, inciting debate over who should cover the bailout. Furthermore, releases of Japan's CPI data and UK retail sales figures are imminent.

The Fed Chair also reinforced his commitment to a 2% inflation target despite global uncertainties.

Powell pointed out that rising bond yields are assisting in tackling stubborn inflation but are also putting pressure on equities; ten-year U.S. Treasury yields reached 4.99%, their highest since July 2007. Despite these tensions and high bond yields, prices are surging towards $2,000 an ounce. Analysts note that gold's traditional negative correlation with bond yields has broken due to geopolitical unrest, potentially easing the Fed's pressure to hike rates.

Mike Archibald of AGF Investments commented on these tighter conditions but also suggested there's a likelihood the Fed might pause rate hikes due to consumer impact. He questioned how long these elevated rates would persist and predicted Powell's continued focus on controlling expectations and maintaining flexibility for possible future hikes.

Meanwhile, U.S. companies reported mixed Q3 earnings: Tesla (NASDAQ: ) saw weaker-than-expected results leading to a 9% drop in its stocks, while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) enjoyed stronger subscriber growth resulting in a 16% increase in its stocks.

The Canadian dollar traded at 72.91 cents against the amidst the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict that caused a surge in commodity prices, with oil nearing $90 per barrel and gold and prices seeing significant increases.

Looking ahead, the Bank of Canada is expected to make a similar rate decision next week. As concerns mount over U.S. debt and potential loss of yield curve control, gold's allure increases, possibly driving further yield increases and prompting the Fed's balance sheet expansion.

The stocks edged higher on Thursday, recovering a small portion of the losses experienced on Wednesday, as investors prepared for more comments from central bankers.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak in the Economic Club of New York later on Thursday with investors guessing if he will endorse remarks from other Fed officials over the last week, who are more dovish than hawkish, the Market Insider said.

Powell's speech comes as the 10-year US Treasury yield approaches 5 per cent.

The yield hit a high of 4.98 per cent on Thursday, it is highest since June 2007.

Investors are also digesting a slew of earnings reports from companies, including Tesla (NASDAQ: ), which missed analyst's profit and revenue estimates, and Netflix (NASDAQ: ), which beat expectations, the Insider said.

Of the 64 companies that reported earnings results so far, 73 per cent have beaten profit estimates by a median of 6 per cent, according to data from Fundstrat.

Tesla is on track to wipe out $40 billion in market value as its shares fell 6 per cent following Elon Musk's downbeat Cybertruck outlook. Netflix stock surged about 15 per cent on Thursday after the company said it added nearly 9 million subscribers during its third quarter. Argentina's lust for the pushed its black-market rate up 60,000 per cent since peso parity ended in 2002.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) predicts the S&P 500 will find a floor and reverse course in the next few months. Here are 40 high-upside stocks to buy as markets rally again.

As 2022 dawned, investors would have been overjoyed to hear that US stocks were up over 11 per cent through the third quarter, considering that the median call among Wall Street experts at the time was for a 5 per cent gain for the full year.

But after the S&P 500 soared nearly 16 per cent in the first half of the year its a disappointment. Higher interest rates and bond yields hampered stocks in the late summer and early fall, culminating in a 4.9 per cent decline in September.

Despite the drop, Goldman Sachs is sticking with its mid-year price target of 4,500 for the S&P 500, which is about 6 per cent higher than current levels. Gradual earnings growth will drive the rally as multiples stay flat, according to David Kostin, the firm's chief US equity strategist.

The analysts comment ""Our prior EW view was based on concerns that consensus expectations for Netflix's new growth drivers - paid sharing and advertising - were too high. This was implied both in consensus estimates and valuation. However, since hitting $475 when it reported 2Q results in July, both those estimates and valuation have come down. Sentiment around the advertising opportunity, in particular, have soured and uncertainty over an elevated investment cycle in '24 emerged.

Incrementally, we are positive on NFLX better-than-expected out-years margin outlook/commentary. We upgrade to Buy (from Hold) with our thesis predicated on ongoing password sharing benefits (into 2024), advertising ramp (long-term), and share buybacks ($10b added to authorization), with top 3 tentpole content to return by 2025 (Squid Game, Wednesday, Stranger Things), with video games a free call option (we believe stock might go up on a hit/viral game or conversely if NFLX were to shutter its games business), and with optional growth levers still available to NFLX as discussed in our preview (additional AVOD tier; FAST tier; box office; others).

2022-10-19, Investing.com,Netflix jumps 14% after surge in third quarter subscribers; earns analyst upgrades,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-jumps-14-after-surge-in-third-quarter-subscribers-earns-analyst-upgrades-3857276,"Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares jumped more than 13.5% in pre-market Thursday trading after it handily beat profit expectations as subscriber numbers rose.

The streaming giant reported of $3.73 on revenue of $8.54 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $3.49 and revenue of $8.54 billion. The third quarter results beat Netflix’s previous guidance.

The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, well above expectations for just over 6 million.

“The last six months have been challenging for our industry given the combined writers and actors strikes in the US,” Netflix said in a shareholder letter, noting that while the writers’ strike has ended, it continues to talk to the actors’ unions. “We’re committed to resolving the remaining issues as quickly as possible so everyone can return to work making movies and TV shows that audiences will love.”

For the fourth quarter, Netflix sees earnings per share of $2.15 and revenue of about $8.69 billion. The revenue growth is expected to be around 10.7%, after growing 7.8% in the third quarter.

The company said operating margin in the third quarter was 22.4%, slightly above its guidance, and it sees 2022 operating margin near the top of its range at 20%.

KeyBanc analysts upgraded shares to Overweight with a $510 per share price target.

""In our view, Netflix is entering 2024E a cleaner story as: 1) paid sharing appears to have changed Netflix's ability to reach the next ~250M subs; 2) operating profit and FCF are steadily ramping; and 3) buybacks should support a 25%+ EPS growth profile,"" they said in an upgrade note.

JPMorgan analysts hiked the price target to $480 per share on the Overweight-rated stock.

""We’re encouraged that NFLX is executing on Paid Sharing by converting borrower households, contributing to revenue acceleration to +12% FXN in 4Q, & we believe the forecast for similar net adds to 3Q +/- a few million should skew to the upside given more favorable seasonality in 4Q & a strong content slate,"" the analysts wrote.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,"Earnings call: Netflix Co-CEOs discuss Q3 2022 results, future strategies and growth prospects",https://in.investing.com/news/earnings-call-netflix-coceos-discuss-q3-2022-results-future-strategies-and-growth-prospects-93CH-3857211,"In the recent Q3 2022 earnings call, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) Co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, along with CFO Spence Neumann, discussed a range of topics including the impact of the Writers Guild strike, the growth of their ads business, and their future outlook. The executives highlighted their commitment to improving programming quality, increasing transparency, and cracking down on password sharing. They also discussed their plans for content investment, cash flow management, and ancillary businesses.

Key takeaways from the call include:

Netflix is committed to resolving the Writers Guild strike and improving the quality of their programming slate. The company plans to provide more transparency to talent regarding streaming data and audience engagement metrics. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix is a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, with high returns on invested capital.

The company is making progress in its crackdown on password sharing and plans to continue the rollout over the next few quarters. The focus remains on acquiring new subscribers and expanding the ads business. It's worth noting that despite recent price drops, with a 1-month price total return of -12.62% according to InvestingPro Data, Netflix remains a valuable investment with a market cap of $154.17 billion.

Netflix's ads business is seeing growth, with Amy Reinhard leading the segment. The company is confident about capturing a share of the $180 billion opportunity in linear and connected TV advertising. As InvestingPro Data shows, Netflix's revenue growth has been 3.53% in the last twelve months, indicating a positive trend.

Netflix expects a more balanced mix of membership and Average Revenue per Member (ARM) growth in 2024 and beyond. The company aims for a 22% to 23% operating margin in 2024. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix is trading at a high earnings multiple, suggesting potential for future growth.

Licensing third-party content remains a crucial part of Netflix's strategy, with shows like Suits and Band of Brothers highlighted as successes on the platform. InvestingPro Tips also indicate that Netflix has been profitable over the last twelve months, further supporting their growth strategy.

Netflix plans to increase content investment in the future while maintaining healthy revenue growth. The company is particularly committed to animated features due to high demand. This is reflected in the company's strong gross profit of $12.456 billion, as per InvestingPro Data.

In terms of cash flow management, Netflix plans to maintain a minimum cash balance of roughly two months of revenue and will return excess cash to shareholders through buybacks. This is in line with InvestingPro's observation that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt.

Netflix sees gaming as a significant opportunity to engage members and increase retention. The company plans to gradually scale its gaming investment and increase engagement over the next few years. This strategy is supported by InvestingPro's data showing a positive 1-year price total return of 27.1%.

Netflix is exploring ancillary businesses such as live events and experiences to deepen fandom and strengthen its brands. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, providing the company with the financial flexibility to explore new ventures.

During the earnings call, Netflix executives also highlighted their strategy for licensing third-party content, the impact of their distribution and recommendation system on shows like ""Suits,"" their partnerships with other suppliers and competitors, and the lasting value of successful shows on the platform. They discussed recent price changes in certain countries and their plans for pricing tiers.

The company also expressed excitement about the success of their sports-related content, including the Tour de France, quarterback, and David Beckham's documentary. Netflix announced the Netflix Cup, a live event that combines the cast of Drive to Survive and Full Swing in a golf tournament, which will be streamed live on November 14.

Netflix is also working on consolidating its Consumer Products and Experiences Group under one umbrella to enhance fan engagement. This initiative aims to strengthen the Netflix brand and provide fans with a place to express their love for the content they watch on the platform. The investment in this area is not significant compared to their overall business.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,"Powell's speech, Netflix, Tesla earnings - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powells-speech-netflix-tesla-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3857185,"Investing.com -- Fed chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the session, while Wall Street indices are set to open lower after bond yields rose to record levels.The earnings season continues in full flow, with Netflix and Tesla in the spotlight after releasing results after Wednesday's close.

1. Powell’s speech in the spotlight

is set to hold the spotlight Thursday, as the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at the Economic Club of New York later in the session, with markets nervous that he may strike a hawkish tone after a series of U.S. data pointed to strength in the economy.

Fed policy makers had recently signaled that the central bank may be close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, as rising yields have done some of their job in cooling the economy by reining in credit.

However, recent data has indicated that the labor market remains strong and inflation sticky, and this prompted New York Federal Reserve president to take a more hawkish stance, stating Wednesday that the Fed will likely keep rates higher for longer for “some time” to rein in inflation toward its 2% target.

The benchmark surged on Wednesday, trading past 4.9% for the first time since 2007.

Another pause on rate hikes for November is nearly fully priced in, according to Investing’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool , but the odds of a December rate hike have jumped to 40% this week from 26% last week.

2. Futures sell off as risk sentiment takes a hit

U.S. stock futures traded lower Thursday, continuing the previous session’s weakness as rising bond yields prompted investors to exit more risky assets.

At 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT), the contract dropped 100 points or 0.3%, fell by 13 points or 0.3%, and dropped by 34 points or 0.2%.

The major indices closed lower Wednesday, weighed by escalating tensions in the Middle East and worries over elevated bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since mid-2007.

Investors have started to become fearful of the possibility of another rate increase in December to round out the year, and all eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he speaks later in the session [see above].

Economic data on deck include weekly , for September and the for October.

There are more earnings to digest during the session [see below], while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the two corporate powerhouses reported results after the close Wednesday.

3. Netflix soars with new subscribers; Tesla disappoints

Netflix’s subscription service was in demand in the third quarter, as the streaming giant shattered expectations for new customers, sending its stock surging over 12% in premarket trading.

The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, boosted by its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts, well above expectations for just over 6 million.

These gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, in the early days of the global pandemic.

Substantial subscriber additions came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.

Netflix also increased subscription prices for some of its streaming plans as it posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with forecasts. Earnings came in at $3.73 per share, ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $3.49.

Tesla, on the other hand, disappointed with its quarterly results as its recent wave of electric vehicle price cuts weighed on margins. Its stock fell over 4% premarket.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the third quarter from 18.7% in the previous quarter.

Tesla delivered 435,000 EVs in the quarter, down from 466,140 in the second quarter, with the company citing upgrades at various factories for the decline in production volumes.

Tesla was also cautious about expanding electric vehicle production capacity, with CEO Elon Musk saying he was worried that higher borrowing costs would prevent potential customers from affording its vehicles despite substantial price cuts.

4. Third-quarter earnings season continues

The quarterly earnings season continues Thursday, with results due from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), telecoms company AT&T (NYSE: ), tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE: ), railroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: ), asset manager Blackstone (NYSE: ) as well as a number of regional banks.

So far, admittedly very early in the season, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Earlier Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier, posted an almost 25% fall in third-quarter net profit as global economic woes hit demand for chips used in applications from cars to cellphones and servers.

Nokia (NYSE: ) announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs in a new cost reduction effort after the Finnish telecom gear manufacturer’s third-quarter sales fell by a fifth, taken down by sales of next-generation 5G equipment.

5. Crude’s recent rally cools

Oil prices fell Thursday, handing back a lot of the previous session’s sharp gains, as markets awaited more developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the outlook for global supply.

By 04:50 ET, the futures traded 1.7% lower at $85.75 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.7% to $89.78 a barrel.

Crude prices climbed about 2% in the previous session on concerns of disruptions to global supplies after Iran called for an oil embargo on Israel over the conflict in Gaza and after the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, reported a larger-than-expected draw.

However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has shown few signs of taking any immediate action on Iran's call, easing worries over potential disruptions.

Prices have also been pressured after a deal was reached between the Venezuelan government and the country's political opposition to ensure fair 2024 elections, potentially allowing the country’s oil flows to reenter the global market after years of sanctions."

(NASDAQ: ) saw significant growth in the third quarter of 2022, adding nine million subscribers and recording an annual revenue increase to $8.5 billion, up 8% from the previous year. The company's net income also rose nearly 20% to $1.6 billion, according to data released on Wednesday. The surge was attributed to an increase in global subscribers, which now total 247 million.

InvestingPro data reveals that Netflix's market cap stands at an impressive $154.17 billion, with a P/E ratio of 36.37, suggesting that investors are willing to pay a high price for the company's earnings. The company's revenue for the last twelve months was $32,126.45 million, marking a growth of 3.53% from the previous year.

The company's content budget for the year stands at $13 billion, down from $17 billion due to ongoing Hollywood strikes. Despite this reduction, Netflix, a prominent player in the Entertainment industry as per InvestingPro Tips, has maintained its competitive edge with successful original series like ""One Piece"" and ""Suits"".

In line with its pricing strategy, Netflix implemented a price hike for its premium ad-free service from $19.99 to $22.99 in the U.S., U.K., and France. This move aims to drive users towards its cheaper ad-inclusive service priced at $6.99 per month. This strategy has received criticism from industry analysts, such as Mike Proulx of Forrester Research (NASDAQ: ) who argued that consumers expect more value for their money and recent price hikes do not offer additional benefits.

Despite these concerns and a weak ad market, Netflix reported a 70% increase in ad-tier memberships and a 30% uptake of the cheaper plan in the 12 countries where this tier was available. The company has also made successful efforts in combating password sharing.

Looking ahead, Netflix expects a drop in net income in Q4 due to higher marketing costs associated with new releases like “The Crown” and Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon.” However, InvestingPro Tips suggest that analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year, and it has been profitable over the last twelve months.

In other developments, Netflix downsized its animation department, leading to cuts and halting two films' production. However, the streaming giant announced a multiyear agreement with Skydance Animation, led by ex-Pixar chief John Lasseter, to develop animated movies directly for Netflix starting from 2024.

As part of their analysis, InvestingPro also noted that despite the company's stock price falling significantly over the last three months, it has seen a high return over the past decade. This, combined with Netflix's high return on invested capital, suggests that stockholders can expect high returns on book equity.

2022-10-18, Investing.com,"Gaza update, Chinese GDP, Netflix earnings - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/gaza-update-chinese-gdp-netflix-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3855286,"Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Biden heads to Israel, while crude prices soared as a missile explosion on a Gaza hospital esclated tensions in the Middle East. The earnings season continues with numbers from Netflix and Tesla, while Chinese GDP expanded by more than expected in the third quarter.

1. Biden heads to Israel

U.S. President Joe Biden flies to Israel on Wednesday in an attempt to soothe heightened tensions in the region after a missile strike on a Gaza hospital killed hundreds of Palestinians.

Palestinian officials said an Israeli air strike hit the hospital, while Israel blamed the blast on a failed rocket launch by Palestinian militants. Both sides denied responsibility.

The news has inflamed an already tense situation and resulted in a planned summit between the U.S. president, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi being cancelled.

Biden will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet later Wednesday, but it’s debatable what he can achieve given the circumstances.

Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council is set to vote later Wednesday on a resolution that calls for humanitarian pauses in the conflict to allow humanitarian aid access to the Gaza Strip.

2. Futures just lower as earnings season continues

U.S. stock futures traded with minor losses Wednesday, as investors digested more quarterly corporate earnings.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract dropped 23 points or 0.1%, fell 7 points or 0.2%, and dropped 40 points or 0.3%.

The major indices traded in a muted fashion Tuesday, but corporate results have generally been impressive at this early stage of the third quarter earnings season.

So far, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Big tech companies take the earnings lead today [see below], but United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the carrier issued disappointing fourth-quarter guidance after the close Tuesday, with higher fuel costs and the suspension of Tel Aviv flights expected to weigh.

JB Hunt (NASDAQ: ) stock also traded lower premarket after the transportation and logistics company fell slightly short on profit expectations in the third quarter.

There are also fresh economic numbers to digest, in the form of and data for September.

3. Netflix expected to receive subscriber boost

The quarterly earnings continues in full flow Wednesday, with results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ), after the close, the day’s highlight.

Netflix suffered a weak quarter last time out, but investors are hoping for better news as its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts could lead to a pick-up in subscriber growth.

Netflix's crackdown on password-sharing is expected to have boosted subscribers by about 6 million in the third quarter, and investors will be looking to see whether this sets the stage for price increases in an attempt to further increase revenue.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) is also due to report after the close of trading, with the electric vehicle manufacturer having already disclosed its third-quarter vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue.

Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 435,000 electric vehicles during the third quarter - not breaking a delivery record for the first time in a long time.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) leads the way before the open, and the banking giant is likely to follow its peers in benefiting from rising net interest income, driven by higher interest rates and loan growth.

4. China’s 3Q GDP grows more than expected

China may have turned the corner, after data released earlier Wednesday showed that the Asian giant’s economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter from a year earlier.

grew 4.9% in July-September from the year earlier, a drop from the 6.3% expansion in the second quarter, but still considerably better than the expected 4.4% increase.

On a quarter-by-quarter basis, GDP grew 1.3% in the third quarter, accelerating from a revised 0.5% in the prior quarter.

Additionally, China's in September grew 4.5% from a year earlier, matching the pace in August, and rose 5.5% in September, accelerating from a 4.6% increase the month earlier.

The world's second-biggest economy has started to show signs of stabilising, helped by a series of stimulus steps from Beijing, although a durable recovery could be hampered by the ongoing crisis in the country’s real estate sector.

There has been no word of Country Garden, China's biggest private property developer, paying a $15 million coupon due, fuelling expectations that it has defaulted on its offshore debt.

Non-payment would trigger cross defaults in other Country Garden bonds, likely prompting one of China's biggest corporate debt restructurings.

5. Crude soars after Gaza hospital explosion

Oil prices soared Wednesday after a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital heightened tensions in the Middle East, thwarting a U.S. diplomatic effort in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 05:00 ET, the futures traded 2.6% higher at $87.66 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2.5% to $92.11 a barrel.

The explosion at the crowded hospital in Gaza, which was blamed on both Israeli and Hamas forces, has renewed concerns that a spillover of this conflict could disrupt crude supplies in the oil-rich region as a planned summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders was cancelled.

The crude market had received a boost late Tuesday after data from the indicated that U.S. inventories fell a hefty 4.4 million barrels in the week to October 13.

This draw comes after a bumper build in the prior week, which also saw U.S. production reach new peaks, and diluted worries about a reduction in demand in the world’s largest consumer.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) from Equalweight to Overweight with a price target of $475.00 (from $430.00).

The analysts comment ""Our prior EW view was based on concerns that consensus expectations for Netflix's new growth drivers - paid sharing and advertising - were too high. This was implied both in consensus estimates and valuation. However, since hitting $475 when it reported 2Q results in July, both those estimates and valuation have come down. Sentiment around the advertising opportunity, in particular, have soured and uncertainty over an elevated investment cycle in '24 emerged. Against this rising anxiety and falling stock price, the business has been accelerating, the password crackdown is working, and the competition has pulled back. With 3Q results, Netflix has provided clear guidance for its content spending and margin expectations for '24, removing some added uncertainty. """

Incrementally, we are positive on NFLX better-than-expected out-years margin outlook/commentary. We upgrade to Buy (from Hold) with our thesis predicated on ongoing password sharing benefits (into 2024), advertising ramp (long-term), and share buybacks ($10b added to authorization), with top 3 tentpole content to return by 2025 (Squid Game, Wednesday, Stranger Things), with video games a free call option (we believe stock might go up on a hit/viral game or conversely if NFLX were to shutter its games business), and with optional growth levers still available to NFLX as discussed in our preview (additional AVOD tier; FAST tier; box office; others). Our $465 price target (up from $430 prior) is based on 25x our 2025E GAAP EPS and is supported by our 10-year DCF model (8.75% WACC, 3.0%/13x/low-30% terminal growth/AEBITDA/OI margin).

The executives highlighted their commitment to improving programming quality, increasing transparency, and cracking down on password sharing. They also discussed their plans for content investment, cash flow management, and ancillary businesses.

Key takeaways from the call include:

Netflix is committed to resolving the Writers Guild strike and improving the quality of their programming slate. The company plans to provide more transparency to talent regarding streaming data and audience engagement metrics. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix is a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, with high returns on invested capital.

The company is making progress in its crackdown on password sharing and plans to continue the rollout over the next few quarters. The focus remains on acquiring new subscribers and expanding the ads business. It's worth noting that despite recent price drops, with a 1-month price total return of -12.62% according to InvestingPro Data, Netflix remains a valuable investment with a market cap of $154.17 billion.

Netflix's ads business is seeing growth, with Amy Reinhard leading the segment. The company is confident about capturing a share of the $180 billion opportunity in linear and connected TV advertising. As InvestingPro Data shows, Netflix's revenue growth has been 3.53% in the last twelve months, indicating a positive trend.

Netflix expects a more balanced mix of membership and Average Revenue per Member (ARM) growth in 2024 and beyond. The company aims for a 22% to 23% operating margin in 2024. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix is trading at a high earnings multiple, suggesting potential for future growth.

Netflix plans to increase content investment in the future while maintaining healthy revenue growth. The company is particularly committed to animated features due to high demand. This is reflected in the company's strong gross profit of $12.456 billion, as per InvestingPro Data.

In terms of cash flow management, Netflix plans to maintain a minimum cash balance of roughly two months of revenue and will return excess cash to shareholders through buybacks. This is in line with InvestingPro's observation that Netflix operates with a moderate level of debt.

Netflix sees gaming as a significant opportunity to engage members and increase retention. The company plans to gradually scale its gaming investment and increase engagement over the next few years. This strategy is supported by InvestingPro's data showing a positive 1-year price total return of 27.1%.

Netflix is exploring ancillary businesses such as live events and experiences to deepen fandom and strengthen its brands. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Netflix's liquid assets exceed short-term obligations, providing the company with the financial flexibility to explore new ventures.

During the earnings call, Netflix executives also highlighted their strategy for licensing third-party content, the impact of their distribution and recommendation system on shows like ""Suits,"" their partnerships with other suppliers and competitors, and the lasting value of successful shows on the platform. They discussed recent price changes in certain countries and their plans for pricing tiers.

Netflix is also working on consolidating its Consumer Products and Experiences Group under one umbrella to enhance fan engagement.

The investment in this area is not significant compared to their overall business.

2022-10-19, Investing.com,"Powell's speech, Netflix, Tesla earnings - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/powells-speech-netflix-tesla-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3857185,"Investing.com -- Fed chair Jerome Powell is set to speak later in the session, while Wall Street indices are set to open lower after bond yields rose to record levels.The earnings season continues in full flow, with Netflix and Tesla in the spotlight after releasing results after Wednesday's close.

1. Powell’s speech in the spotlight

is set to hold the spotlight Thursday, as the Federal Reserve chairman speaks at the Economic Club of New York later in the session, with markets nervous that he may strike a hawkish tone after a series of U.S. data pointed to strength in the economy.

Fed policy makers had recently signaled that the central bank may be close to ending its rate-hiking cycle, as rising yields have done some of their job in cooling the economy by reining in credit.

However, recent data has indicated that the labor market remains strong and inflation sticky, and this prompted New York Federal Reserve president to take a more hawkish stance, stating Wednesday that the Fed will likely keep rates higher for longer for “some time” to rein in inflation toward its 2% target.

The benchmark surged on Wednesday, trading past 4.9% for the first time since 2007.

Another pause on rate hikes for November is nearly fully priced in, according to Investing’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool , but the odds of a December rate hike have jumped to 40% this week from 26% last week.

2. Futures sell off as risk sentiment takes a hit

U.S. stock futures traded lower Thursday, continuing the previous session’s weakness as rising bond yields prompted investors to exit more risky assets.

At 04:50 ET (08:50 GMT), the contract dropped 100 points or 0.3%, fell by 13 points or 0.3%, and dropped by 34 points or 0.2%.

The major indices closed lower Wednesday, weighed by escalating tensions in the Middle East and worries over elevated bond yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbing to its highest level since mid-2007.

Investors have started to become fearful of the possibility of another rate increase in December to round out the year, and all eyes will be on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as he speaks later in the session [see above].

Economic data on deck include weekly , for September and the for October.

There are more earnings to digest during the session [see below], while Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the two corporate powerhouses reported results after the close Wednesday.

3. Netflix soars with new subscribers; Tesla disappoints

Netflix’s subscription service was in demand in the third quarter, as the streaming giant shattered expectations for new customers, sending its stock surging over 12% in premarket trading.

The company said paid subscribers rose 8.76 million in the third quarter, boosted by its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts, well above expectations for just over 6 million.

These gains represented its strongest quarterly uptick since the second quarter of 2020, in the early days of the global pandemic.

Substantial subscriber additions came in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, where Netflix added nearly 4 million subscribers. More than 70% of its members now reside outside the United States.

Netflix also increased subscription prices for some of its streaming plans as it posted revenue of $8.54 billion, in line with forecasts. Earnings came in at $3.73 per share, ahead of Wall Street's expectation of $3.49.

Tesla, on the other hand, disappointed with its quarterly results as its recent wave of electric vehicle price cuts weighed on margins. Its stock fell over 4% premarket.

Gross margins excluding credits, which have been closely watched following recent price EV cuts, slowed to 16.1% in the third quarter from 18.7% in the previous quarter.

Tesla delivered 435,000 EVs in the quarter, down from 466,140 in the second quarter, with the company citing upgrades at various factories for the decline in production volumes.

Tesla was also cautious about expanding electric vehicle production capacity, with CEO Elon Musk saying he was worried that higher borrowing costs would prevent potential customers from affording its vehicles despite substantial price cuts.

4. Third-quarter earnings season continues

The quarterly earnings season continues Thursday, with results due from the likes of American Airlines (NASDAQ: ), telecoms company AT&T (NYSE: ), tobacco giant Philip Morris (NYSE: ), railroad operator CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: ), asset manager Blackstone (NYSE: ) as well as a number of regional banks.

So far, admittedly very early in the season, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Earlier Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple (NASDAQ: ) supplier, posted an almost 25% fall in third-quarter net profit as global economic woes hit demand for chips used in applications from cars to cellphones and servers.

Nokia (NYSE: ) announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs in a new cost reduction effort after the Finnish telecom gear manufacturer’s third-quarter sales fell by a fifth, taken down by sales of next-generation 5G equipment.

5. Crude’s recent rally cools

Oil prices fell Thursday, handing back a lot of the previous session’s sharp gains, as markets awaited more developments in the Israel-Hamas war and the outlook for global supply.

By 04:50 ET, the futures traded 1.7% lower at $85.75 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.7% to $89.78 a barrel.

Crude prices climbed about 2% in the previous session on concerns of disruptions to global supplies after Iran called for an oil embargo on Israel over the conflict in Gaza and after the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, reported a larger-than-expected draw.

However, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has shown few signs of taking any immediate action on Iran's call, easing worries over potential disruptions.

Prices have also been pressured after a deal was reached between the Venezuelan government and the country's political opposition to ensure fair 2024 elections, potentially allowing the country’s oil flows to reenter the global market after years of sanctions."

(NASDAQ: ) saw significant growth in the third quarter of 2022, adding nine million subscribers and recording an annual revenue increase to $8.5 billion, up 8% from the previous year. The company's net income also rose nearly 20% to $1.6 billion, according to data released on Wednesday. The surge was attributed to an increase in global subscribers, which now total 247 million.

InvestingPro data reveals that Netflix's market cap stands at an impressive $154.17 billion, with a P/E ratio of 36.37, suggesting that investors are willing to pay a high price for the company's earnings. The company's revenue for the last twelve months was $32,126.45 million, marking a growth of 3.53% from the previous year.

The company's content budget for the year stands at $13 billion, down from $17 billion due to ongoing Hollywood strikes. Despite this reduction, Netflix, a prominent player in the Entertainment industry as per InvestingPro Tips, has maintained its competitive edge with successful original series like ""One Piece"" and ""Suits"".

In line with its pricing strategy, Netflix implemented a price hike for its premium ad-free service from $19.99 to $22.99 in the U.S., U.K., and France. This move aims to drive users towards its cheaper ad-inclusive service priced at $6.99 per month. This strategy has received criticism from industry analysts, such as Mike Proulx of Forrester Research (NASDAQ: ) who argued that consumers expect more value for their money and recent price hikes do not offer additional benefits.

Despite these concerns and a weak ad market, Netflix reported a 70% increase in ad-tier memberships and a 30% uptake of the cheaper plan in the 12 countries where this tier was available. The company has also made successful efforts in combating password sharing.

Looking ahead, Netflix expects a drop in net income in Q4 due to higher marketing costs associated with new releases like “The Crown” and Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon.” However, InvestingPro Tips suggest that analysts predict the company will remain profitable this year, and it has been profitable over the last twelve months.

In other developments, Netflix downsized its animation department, leading to cuts and halting two films' production. However, the streaming giant announced a multiyear agreement with Skydance Animation, led by ex-Pixar chief John Lasseter, to develop animated movies directly for Netflix starting from 2024.

As part of their analysis, InvestingPro also noted that despite the company's stock price falling significantly over the last three months, it has seen a high return over the past decade. This, combined with Netflix's high return on invested capital, suggests that stockholders can expect high returns on book equity.

So far, 83% of companies have so far topped earnings expectations, while about 70% have surpassed sales estimates, according to FactSet data.

Big tech companies take the earnings lead today [see below], but United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) will also be in the spotlight after the carrier issued disappointing fourth-quarter guidance after the close Tuesday, with higher fuel costs and the suspension of Tel Aviv flights expected to weigh.

There are also fresh economic numbers to digest, in the form of and data for September.

3. Netflix expected to receive subscriber boost

The quarterly earnings continues in full flow Wednesday, with results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ), after the close, the day’s highlight.

Netflix suffered a weak quarter last time out, but investors are hoping for better news as its efforts to restrict sharing of accounts could lead to a pick-up in subscriber growth.

Netflix's crackdown on password-sharing is expected to have boosted subscribers by about 6 million in the third quarter, and investors will be looking to see whether this sets the stage for price increases in an attempt to further increase revenue.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) is also due to report after the close of trading, with the electric vehicle manufacturer having already disclosed its third-quarter vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company’s revenue.

Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that it delivered just over 435,000 electric vehicles during the third quarter - not breaking a delivery record for the first time in a long time.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) leads the way before the open, and the banking giant is likely to follow its peers in benefiting from rising net interest income, driven by higher interest rates and loan growth.

4. China’s 3Q GDP grows more than expected

China may have turned the corner, after data released earlier Wednesday showed that the Asian giant’s economy grew at a faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter from a year earlier.

grew 4.9% in July-September from the year earlier, a drop from the 6.3% expansion in the second quarter, but still considerably better than the expected 4.4% increase.

Additionally, China's in September grew 4.5% from a year earlier, matching the pace in August, and rose 5.5% in September, accelerating from a 4.6% increase the month earlier.

The world's second-biggest economy has started to show signs of stabilising, helped by a series of stimulus steps from Beijing, although a durable recovery could be hampered by the ongoing crisis in the country’s real estate sector.

There has been no word of Country Garden, China's biggest private property developer, paying a $15 million coupon due, fuelling expectations that it has defaulted on its offshore debt.

Non-payment would trigger cross defaults in other Country Garden bonds, likely prompting one of China's biggest corporate debt restructurings.

5. Crude soars after Gaza hospital explosion

Oil prices soared Wednesday after a deadly blast at a Gaza hospital heightened tensions in the Middle East, thwarting a U.S. diplomatic effort in the Israel-Hamas war.

By 05:00 ET, the futures traded 2.6% higher at $87.66 a barrel, while the contract climbed 2.5% to $92.11 a barrel.

The explosion at the crowded hospital in Gaza, which was blamed on both Israeli and Hamas forces, has renewed concerns that a spillover of this conflict could disrupt crude supplies in the oil-rich region as a planned summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian and Palestinian leaders was cancelled.

The crude market had received a boost late Tuesday after data from the indicated that U.S. inventories fell a hefty 4.4 million barrels in the week to October 13.

Despite this, historical data indicates a potential recovery in October. Investors are closely watching five key factors that could influence this trajectory.

The Biden administration's restrictions on Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) chip sales to China have been one of the significant influences on the market. The move, aimed at curbing China's access to advanced semiconductors for AI breakthroughs, affected semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia itself, the Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ). Despite this, the sector displayed resilience with a ""bend, don’t break"" price action and rallied intra-day.

Another factor contributing to market volatility is the week of monthly options expiration. During this period, choppy price action is often observed as traders and institutional investors adjust positions related to expiring options contracts.

The commencement of earnings season also plays a role in shaping market dynamics. The highly anticipated earnings releases from Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) are expected to cause ripples in the market.

Geopolitical tensions following an attack on Israel have added another layer of uncertainty. Despite rumors of an imminent Israeli ground attack, the Israeli military has indicated otherwise. This situation could significantly impact equities, the US Dollar, and .

Lastly, despite recent weakness in small-cap stocks, there are indications of a possible reversal in November. Historical data suggests that the iShares Index ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) typically performs well during this period.

As summer ends and end-of-year seasonality generally favors stocks, these five market areas should be closely monitored by investors. The interplay of these factors will likely shape the course of US equities as they navigate the pre-election turbulence and look toward a potential recovery.

While the streaming giant initially focused on mobile games, it is now looking to develop higher-end games that can be streamed on TVs or PCs, competing with major players like Sony (NYSE: ) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), the Wall Street Journal reported.

In the coming months, Netflix subscribers will have the opportunity to play games on their mobile devices based on popular shows like ""Squid Game"" and ""Wednesday."" Netflix is also in discussions to create games based on other content like ""Extraction,"" its Sherlock Holmes series, and ""Black Mirror.""

In addition to developing its own titles, Netflix will continue to license existing games in its catalog.

Furthermore, Netflix has explored the possibility of releasing a game within the popular ""Grand Theft Auto"" series through a licensing deal with Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ: ).

Netflix's games are currently offered to subscribers at no extra charge, and the company does not generate revenue directly from these games. The primary purpose of these games is to enhance the overall subscriber experience by providing an engaging and interactive element to the platform.

It serves as a strategy to retain existing subscribers and attract new ones, especially during periods when their favorite shows are not actively releasing new content."
2022-10-16, Investing.com,"Blinken's diplomatic mission, corporate earnings, Rite Aid - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/blinkens-diplomatic-mission-corporate-earnings-rite-aid--whats-moving-markets-3851419,"Investing.com -- U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken seeks to limit the extent of the conflict in the Middle East, while the focus on Wall Street turns to the new quarterly corporate earnings season. Rite Aid has filed for bankruptcy while crude prices consolidate after recent hefty gains.

1. Blinken attempts to limit Middle East conflict

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken returns to Israel on Monday as part of a concerted diplomatic attempt to ensure Israel's conflict with Palestinian militant group Hamas does not spillover elsewhere in the region.

Israel has imposed a strict blockade on the Gaza region as it carries out a heavy bombardment in preparation for a ground invasion.

Blinken has already visited Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to limit the scope of the conflict.

However, tensions are rising as Iran, which backs Hamas, the dominant power in Gaza, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians.

""If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,"" said Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Tehran could not simply stay an observer.

“We are on the verge of the abyss in the Middle East,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned in a statement Sunday.

2. Futures edge higher; Powell set to speak later in week

U.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, at the start of a busy week for quarterly corporate earnings.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract added 100 points or 0.3%, climbed by 10 points or 0.2%, and inched up by 15 points or 0.1%.

The third quarter earnings season picks up steam this week [see below], with several major U.S. companies expected to show an improvement in profit growth after a tepid first half.

The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, and eyes will quickly turn to U.S. retail sales figures for September, due on Tuesday, will give investors insight into the strength of consumer spending.

There are a number of Fed officials due to speak this week, but most attention will be on comments by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday when he addresses the Economic Club of New York, just before the start of the central bank's blackout period.

3. Earnings season gets going in earnest

The quarterly earnings kicks into top gear this week with 11% of the slated to report, although Monday is a little short of star quality.

Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) is the biggest name due later in the session, and the lender follows on from JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ) reporting quarterly profits on Friday that outstripped analysts' estimates boosted by higher interest rates.

Continuing the banking theme, Bank of America (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are both due ahead of the open on Tuesday.

Other big names include healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), reporting ahead of Tuesday’s market open, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) ahead of Wednesday’s open, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) after Wednesday’s close and Philip Morris (NYSE: ) ahead of the open on Thursday.

4. Rite Aid files for bankruptcy

Rite Aid (NYSE: ) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday as the drugstore chain struggles with slowing sales, mounting debt and a slew of lawsuits over its alleged role in the U.S. opioid crisis.

Rite Aid has been named as a defendant, along with other pharmacy chains, in lawsuits that alleged they helped fuel the opioid crisis in the U.S..

The filing will allow the company to resolve litigation claims in an ""equitable manner"", a spokesperson said.

Rite Aid said it has received a commitment for $3.45 billion in new financing from some of its lenders, even as it struggled with total debts of $8.60 billion as of June 3.

Rite Aid also appointed Jeffrey Stein as its new CEO and chief restructuring officer, replacing interim CEO Elizabeth Burr, and announced it will close more of its underperforming stores.

5. Oil consolidates after conflict-inspired gains

Oil prices edged lower Monday, consolidating after last week’s hefty gains as traders awaited any more developments in the Israel-Hamas war given the potential for a hit to global supply.

By 05:00 ET, the futures traded 0.3% lower at $86.09 a barrel, while the contract dropped 0.4% to $90.50.

Both benchmarks climbed nearly 6% on Friday, posting their highest daily percentage gains since April, and for the week, Brent advanced 7.5% while WTI climbed 5.9%.

Israel is not a big player in terms of crude production, but concerns are mounting about any potential escalation which could impact supplies from countries in the world's top oil producing region, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.

“Uncertainty and concern over the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war continue to support the oil market. In recent days, Iran has warned about the risk of a wider conflict, while there are reports that Saudi Arabia has frozen talks to normalize relations with Israel,” said analysts at ING, in a note."

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Microsoft closes Activision deal, owes billions to the IRS

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) have finally completed the transaction to merge - Microsoft's largest deal in its 48-year history - after intense regulatory scrutiny and related delays, per the deal that the companies announced back in January 2022.

In accordance with that agreement, Activision Blizzard became a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft as a subsidiary of Microsoft - Anchorage Merger Sub Inc. - merged with and into Activision Blizzard.

Microsoft successfully addressed myriad competition concerns from U.K. and European regulators and received a favorable ruling from a U.S. district judge in this regard, and the news came after the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the buyout, excluding cloud gaming rights, would help maintain competitive pricing and improve services.

Still, even after the closing of the deal, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it continued to oppose the pact and remained focused on its appeal against it.

“Today we start the work to bring beloved Activision, Blizzard, and King franchises to Game Pass and other platforms,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a blog post.

Separately, Microsoft revealed in an 8-K filing that the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) has notified the company of a $28.9 billion back-tax claim, along with penalties and interest, for the tax years 2004 to 2013.

This dispute revolves around how Microsoft allocated profits across various countries and jurisdictions during that period. Microsoft also notes that the proposed adjustments are taxes paid under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which could potentially reduce the final tax liability under the audit by up to $10B.

The company intends to appeal the IRS's claim, and the company does not anticipate any immediate changes in its tax liabilities, as the IRS Appeals process is expected to take several years to complete.

Analysts at BofA don’t expect to see material impact on FY24/25 EPS or FCF, writing, ""The $28.9 billion represents 111% of Microsoft’s deferred income tax liabilities and 45% of the company’s net cash balance.""

Microsoft shares barely budged for the week, closing Friday at $327.73.

Arm Holdings picks up slew of buy ratings

Chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) earned a series of top ratings from several major brokerages following its highly anticipated IPO last month, bringing an end to a customary quiet period for Arm's underwriters.

Arm's debut garnered $4.87 billion for the company's 90% owner SoftBank (TYO: ) in the largest listing so far this year.

Arm, which holds a near-monopoly in terms of share of the lucrative smartphone market, has been hit by a recent downturn in demand for the devices.

But in notes to clients, a raft of key brokerages initiated their coverage of Arm with buy-equivalent ratings, citing optimism around the firm's plans to generate revenue through elevated royalty fees and its focus on building its presence in cloud and automotive markets.

""We believe these strategic shifts and the higher royalty rates they can command should accelerate the company's revenue growth and further expand the valuation premium at which the company historically traded, based on the uniqueness and ubiquity of its technology ecosystem as well as the highly profitable and predictable nature of its business model,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said, giving Arm a Buy rating and a price target of $60.

Goldman Sachs, which set a price target of $62, also predicted that Arm would continue to bolster its smartphone dominance through the increased royalties.

Other analysts at Citi, Mizuho and TD Cowen also delivered price targets of between $60 to $70, with JPMorgan taking the most bullish view.

Arm shares lost some 6% for the week, closing at $50.78. They had debuted at $51.

Netflix loses Outperform rating at Wolfe Research

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) took a hit Friday trade after Wolfe Research cut the streaming giant's rating to Peer Perform from Outperform.

“2024 ARPU [average revenue per user] expectations look full, while today's paid-sharing net adds lead to tomorrow's gross add shortfalls,” the analysts wrote in a downgrade note.

While Netflix has been expanding its share of the global premium video revenue, the analyst flagged 2024-2025 growth forecasts as being too optimistic.

“If future growth falls short, we doubt that NFLX's 50% P/E and 70% EV/EBITDA premium to the S&P would hold up,"" they added.

The firm's prior bullish thesis was built on the expected transition from a land-grab phase to a more efficient one that aims to monetize existing viewership by addressing issues such as ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) and password sharing among 100 million global users.

“With reports of slow AVOD adoption, recent ARM shortfalls signaling trade down, management signaling less margin expansion, and a lack of compelling 3P data on sub growth, we believe the risk/ reward for NFLX is balanced,” the analyst said.

Shares lost nearly 7% for the week to $355.68.

2022-10-15, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3850697,"Investing.com -- Geopolitical tensions remain to the fore, while earnings and U.S. retail sales data will give an insight into the health of the consumer. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is to speak while economic data out of China and the U.K. will be closely watched. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Earnings season picks up

Third quarter earnings season picks up steam, with several major U.S. companies due to report results in a season expected to show an improvement in profit growth after a tepid first half.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) kicks off earnings for the megacaps after the close on Wednesday. These companies' shares have been central drivers of the rally in equity markets so far this year.

Bank of America (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are both set to report ahead of the open on Tuesday and several regional banks are also to report during the coming week.

On Friday, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ) reported quarterly profits that outstripped analysts' estimates boosted by higher interest rates.

Other big names include healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), reporting ahead of Tuesday’s market open, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) ahead of Wednesday’s open, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) after Wednesday’s close and Philip Morris (NYSE: ) ahead of the open on Thursday.

U.S. data; Fedspeak

Aside from earnings, U.S. retail sales figures for September, due on Tuesday, will give investors insight into the strength of consumer spending, which drives around two-thirds of the economy.

Economists are expecting retail sales to have risen last month. A stronger-than-expected reading could stir fears of a rebound in inflation and add to the view that the Federal Reserve will need to keep rates higher for longer.

Market watchers will be closely watching comments by Fed Chair Jerome on Thursday when he addresses the Economic Club of New York.

Several regional Fed presidents are also due to make appearances during the week including Patrick , Thomas , Neel Kashkari, Loretta Mester and Lorie . Fed Governors Lisa and Christopher are also due to make speeches.

Oil volatility

prices surged almost 6% on Friday, with posting its biggest weekly gain since February, as investors priced in the possibility that the conflict in the Middle East could widen as Israel began ground raids inside the Gaza Strip.

The conflict in the Middle East has had little impact on global oil and gas supplies, and Israel is not a big producer. Investors and market observers, however, are assessing how it could escalate and what it might mean for supplies from nearby countries in the world's top oil producing region.

Also pushing prices higher was the U.S. move on Thursday to impose the first sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the Group of Seven's price cap of $60 a barrel, an effort to close loopholes in the mechanism designed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia is the world's second-largest oil producer and a major exporter, and the tighter U.S. scrutiny of its shipments could curtail supply.

China data

Market watchers will be looking to a flurry of economic data out of China on Wednesday for indications that the uneven recovery in the world's second largest economy is stabilizing, as questions remain over the impact of the crisis in the country's property sector and how much additional stimulus Beijing may still need to roll out.

Economists are expecting data on gross domestic product to point to a modest pick-up of year-over-year, still below Beijing’s annual growth target of about 5%.

There have been reports the government is looking to increase its budget deficit to meet this year's 5% growth target.

Separate reports on , and are expected to point to slight improvements.

U.K. data

The U.K. is to release its latest report on Tuesday followed a day later by figures for September, which will be the final such reports ahead of the Bank of England’s upcoming November meeting.

U.K. inflation has come in above expectations and ahead of BoE forecasts for most of the year before slowing more than expected in August, wrongfooting markets. That said, it’s still well above the BoE’s 2% target.

Meanwhile, the last jobs report indicated that the U.K. labor market was starting to cool, but wage growth remained hot.

Last month the BoE narrowly voted to keep rates on hold for the first time in almost two years, raising the prospect that peak rates have been reached, but indicated that it stands ready to take further action to rein in inflation if needed.

2022-10-17, Investing.com,"US Equities Navigate Pre-election Turbulence, Eyeing Potential Recovery",https://in.investing.com/news/us-equities-navigate-preelection-turbulence-eyeing-potential-recovery-93CH-3854741,"Tuesday's pre-election period saw a downturn in US equities, including the ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), amid a storm of volatility and uncertainty. Despite this, historical data indicates a potential recovery in October. Investors are closely watching five key factors that could influence this trajectory.

The Biden administration's restrictions on Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) chip sales to China have been one of the significant influences on the market. The move, aimed at curbing China's access to advanced semiconductors for AI breakthroughs, affected semiconductor stocks such as Nvidia itself, the Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ). Despite this, the sector displayed resilience with a ""bend, don’t break"" price action and rallied intra-day.

Another factor contributing to market volatility is the week of monthly options expiration. During this period, choppy price action is often observed as traders and institutional investors adjust positions related to expiring options contracts.

The commencement of earnings season also plays a role in shaping market dynamics. The highly anticipated earnings releases from Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) are expected to cause ripples in the market.

Geopolitical tensions following an attack on Israel have added another layer of uncertainty. Despite rumors of an imminent Israeli ground attack, the Israeli military has indicated otherwise. This situation could significantly impact equities, the US Dollar, and .

Lastly, despite recent weakness in small-cap stocks, there are indications of a possible reversal in November. Historical data suggests that the iShares Index ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) typically performs well during this period.

As summer ends and end-of-year seasonality generally favors stocks, these five market areas should be closely monitored by investors. The interplay of these factors will likely shape the course of US equities as they navigate the pre-election turbulence and look toward a potential recovery.

Israel has imposed a strict blockade on the Gaza region as it carries out a heavy bombardment in preparation for a ground invasion.

Blinken has already visited Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to limit the scope of the conflict.

However, tensions are rising as Iran, which backs Hamas, the dominant power in Gaza, warned Israel of escalation if it kept attacking Palestinians.

""If the Zionist aggressions do not stop, the hands of all parties in the region are on the trigger,"" said Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, adding that Tehran could not simply stay an observer.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Microsoft closes Activision deal, owes billions to the IRS

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) have finally completed the transaction to merge - Microsoft's largest deal in its 48-year history - after intense regulatory scrutiny and related delays, per the deal that the companies announced back in January 2022.

In accordance with that agreement, Activision Blizzard became a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft as a subsidiary of Microsoft - Anchorage Merger Sub Inc. - merged with and into Activision Blizzard.

Microsoft successfully addressed myriad competition concerns from U.K. and European regulators and received a favorable ruling from a U.S. district judge in this regard, and the news came after the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the buyout, excluding cloud gaming rights, would help maintain competitive pricing and improve services.

Still, even after the closing of the deal, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it continued to oppose the pact and remained focused on its appeal against it.

“Today we start the work to bring beloved Activision, Blizzard, and King franchises to Game Pass and other platforms,” Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a blog post.

Separately, Microsoft revealed in an 8-K filing that the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) has notified the company of a $28.9 billion back-tax claim, along with penalties and interest, for the tax years 2004 to 2013.

This dispute revolves around how Microsoft allocated profits across various countries and jurisdictions during that period. Microsoft also notes that the proposed adjustments are taxes paid under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which could potentially reduce the final tax liability under the audit by up to $10B.

The company intends to appeal the IRS's claim, and the company does not anticipate any immediate changes in its tax liabilities, as the IRS Appeals process is expected to take several years to complete.

Analysts at BofA don’t expect to see material impact on FY24/25 EPS or FCF, writing, ""The $28.9 billion represents 111% of Microsoft’s deferred income tax liabilities and 45% of the company’s net cash balance.""

Microsoft shares barely budged for the week, closing Friday at $327.73.

Arm Holdings picks up slew of buy ratings

Chip designer Arm Holdings (NASDAQ: ) earned a series of top ratings from several major brokerages following its highly anticipated IPO last month, bringing an end to a customary quiet period for Arm's underwriters.

Arm's debut garnered $4.87 billion for the company's 90% owner SoftBank (TYO: ) in the largest listing so far this year.

Arm, which holds a near-monopoly in terms of share of the lucrative smartphone market, has been hit by a recent downturn in demand for the devices.

But in notes to clients, a raft of key brokerages initiated their coverage of Arm with buy-equivalent ratings, citing optimism around the firm's plans to generate revenue through elevated royalty fees and its focus on building its presence in cloud and automotive markets.

""We believe these strategic shifts and the higher royalty rates they can command should accelerate the company's revenue growth and further expand the valuation premium at which the company historically traded, based on the uniqueness and ubiquity of its technology ecosystem as well as the highly profitable and predictable nature of its business model,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said, giving Arm a Buy rating and a price target of $60.

Goldman Sachs, which set a price target of $62, also predicted that Arm would continue to bolster its smartphone dominance through the increased royalties.

Other analysts at Citi, Mizuho and TD Cowen also delivered price targets of between $60 to $70, with JPMorgan taking the most bullish view.

Arm shares lost some 6% for the week, closing at $50.78. They had debuted at $51.

Netflix loses Outperform rating at Wolfe Research

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) took a hit Friday trade after Wolfe Research cut the streaming giant's rating to Peer Perform from Outperform.

“2024 ARPU [average revenue per user] expectations look full, while today's paid-sharing net adds lead to tomorrow's gross add shortfalls,” the analysts wrote in a downgrade note.

While Netflix has been expanding its share of the global premium video revenue, the analyst flagged 2024-2025 growth forecasts as being too optimistic.

“If future growth falls short, we doubt that NFLX's 50% P/E and 70% EV/EBITDA premium to the S&P would hold up,"" they added.

The firm's prior bullish thesis was built on the expected transition from a land-grab phase to a more efficient one that aims to monetize existing viewership by addressing issues such as ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) and password sharing among 100 million global users.

“With reports of slow AVOD adoption, recent ARM shortfalls signaling trade down, management signaling less margin expansion, and a lack of compelling 3P data on sub growth, we believe the risk/ reward for NFLX is balanced,” the analyst said.

Shares lost nearly 7% for the week to $355.68.

2022-10-15, Investing.com,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,https://in.investing.com/news/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3850697,"Investing.com -- Geopolitical tensions remain to the fore, while earnings and U.S. retail sales data will give an insight into the health of the consumer. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is to speak while economic data out of China and the U.K. will be closely watched. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Earnings season picks up

Third quarter earnings season picks up steam, with several major U.S. companies due to report results in a season expected to show an improvement in profit growth after a tepid first half.

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) kicks off earnings for the megacaps after the close on Wednesday. These companies' shares have been central drivers of the rally in equity markets so far this year.

Bank of America (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are both set to report ahead of the open on Tuesday and several regional banks are also to report during the coming week.

On Friday, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ) reported quarterly profits that outstripped analysts' estimates boosted by higher interest rates.

Other big names include healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), reporting ahead of Tuesday’s market open, consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) ahead of Wednesday’s open, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) after Wednesday’s close and Philip Morris (NYSE: ) ahead of the open on Thursday.

U.S. data; Fedspeak

Aside from earnings, U.S. retail sales figures for September, due on Tuesday, will give investors insight into the strength of consumer spending, which drives around two-thirds of the economy.

Economists are expecting retail sales to have risen last month. A stronger-than-expected reading could stir fears of a rebound in inflation and add to the view that the Federal Reserve will need to keep rates higher for longer.

Market watchers will be closely watching comments by Fed Chair Jerome on Thursday when he addresses the Economic Club of New York.

Several regional Fed presidents are also due to make appearances during the week including Patrick , Thomas , Neel Kashkari, Loretta Mester and Lorie . Fed Governors Lisa and Christopher are also due to make speeches.

Oil volatility

prices surged almost 6% on Friday, with posting its biggest weekly gain since February, as investors priced in the possibility that the conflict in the Middle East could widen as Israel began ground raids inside the Gaza Strip.

The conflict in the Middle East has had little impact on global oil and gas supplies, and Israel is not a big producer. Investors and market observers, however, are assessing how it could escalate and what it might mean for supplies from nearby countries in the world's top oil producing region.

Also pushing prices higher was the U.S. move on Thursday to impose the first sanctions on owners of tankers carrying Russian oil priced above the Group of Seven's price cap of $60 a barrel, an effort to close loopholes in the mechanism designed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.

Russia is the world's second-largest oil producer and a major exporter, and the tighter U.S. scrutiny of its shipments could curtail supply.

China data

Market watchers will be looking to a flurry of economic data out of China on Wednesday for indications that the uneven recovery in the world's second largest economy is stabilizing, as questions remain over the impact of the crisis in the country's property sector and how much additional stimulus Beijing may still need to roll out.

Economists are expecting data on gross domestic product to point to a modest pick-up of year-over-year, still below Beijing’s annual growth target of about 5%.

There have been reports the government is looking to increase its budget deficit to meet this year's 5% growth target.

Separate reports on , and are expected to point to slight improvements.

U.K. data

The U.K. is to release its latest report on Tuesday followed a day later by figures for September, which will be the final such reports ahead of the Bank of England’s upcoming November meeting.

U.K. inflation has come in above expectations and ahead of BoE forecasts for most of the year before slowing more than expected in August, wrongfooting markets. That said, it’s still well above the BoE’s 2% target.

Meanwhile, the last jobs report indicated that the U.K. labor market was starting to cool, but wage growth remained hot.

Last month the BoE narrowly voted to keep rates on hold for the first time in almost two years, raising the prospect that peak rates have been reached, but indicated that it stands ready to take further action to rein in inflation if needed.

The analyst comments ""As Netflix approaches its 3Q23 earnings report Oct. 18, we see the key issue as paid sharing. Our survey work (as outlined in a companion note today) suggests that the lift to Netflix from cracking down on account sharing should have been much larger than indicated by the 5.9 million global net adds to 238 million in 2Q23, and guidance for a consistent net add trend in 3Q23, +/- ~ 2 million subs (we model 6.9 million). Netflix, after all, started in 2Q23 clamping down on the 100 million globally (30 million in U.S./Canada) who it said use accounts shared by someone outside their household. Our survey work suggested that, in the U.S. at least, ~ 40% were likely to convert to paying, a result not apparent in 2Q23 actuals. Will we see a bigger lift in 3Q23 to paid subs from the sharing crackdown, consistent with our survey work? If so, the stock would like it, and other streamers could benefit, as our survey work suggests they have a bigger proportionate lift opportunity from paid subs than Netflix. However, our check of Netflix operating data into 3Q23 is not telling a clear story of acceleration. Instead, the data is mixed, and suggestive of some caution into the report."""

Analysts at JPMorgan told investors in a note that the focus will be on the paid sharing progress, ad scale average revenue per membership (ARM) into Q4 and 2024, and operating margin trajectory.

""We remain positive on NFLX overall, but we recognize there is a growing list of questions into 3Q earnings w/the Street looking for more clarity around recent conference comments, ad business leadership changes, and whether a softer margin trajectory is coming from a position of competitive strength or slower growth (or both),"" the analysts said, who maintained a Buy rating and $455 price target on the stock.

The firm estimates NFLX will have cumulative borrower monetization of 18 million by the end of 2022, 30 million by the end of 2024, and 37 million by the end of 2025. In addition, they estimate 10 million ad tier subscribers at the end of 2022, ""which would mean 20M+ MAUs/viewers, which could prove optimistic.""

Analysts at Citi, who maintained a Buy rating and $500 price target on the stock, said the set-up has three facets.

""First, the good news: Netflix continues to take share of video viewing and the ad tier still has significant upside potential. Second, the neutral news: We expect Netflix to report results in line with the Street on all key metrics. Third, the bad news: consensus estimates for 4Q23 and 2024 may need to come down for revenues and margins,"" the analysts explained.

""To us, this suggests bearish tactical positioning may be reasonable. But, once sell-side estimates get reset, we believe Netflix remains a compelling Buy as rivals increase pricing and moderate content spending opening up a window for Netflix to distance itself from rivals,"" they added."

The analyst comments ""As Netflix approaches its 3Q23 earnings report Oct. 18, we see the key issue as paid sharing. Our survey work (as outlined in a companion note today) suggests that the lift to Netflix from cracking down on account sharing should have been much larger than indicated by the 5.9 million global net adds to 238 million in 2Q23, and guidance for a consistent net add trend in 3Q23, +/- ~ 2 million subs (we model 6.9 million). Netflix, after all, started in 2Q23 clamping down on the 100 million globally (30 million in U.S./Canada) who it said use accounts shared by someone outside their household. Our survey work suggested that, in the U.S. at least, ~ 40% were likely to convert to paying, a result not apparent in 2Q23 actuals. Will we see a bigger lift in 3Q23 to paid subs from the sharing crackdown, consistent with our survey work? If so, the stock would like it, and other streamers could benefit, as our survey work suggests they have a bigger proportionate lift opportunity from paid subs than Netflix. However, our check of Netflix operating data into 3Q23 is not telling a clear story of acceleration. Instead, the data is mixed, and suggestive of some caution into the report."""

While Netflix has been expanding its share of the global premium video revenue, the analysts flag 2024-2025 growth forecasts as too optimistic.

“If future growth falls short, we doubt that NFLX's 50% P/E and 70% EV/EBITDA premium to the would hold up.”

The prior bullish thesis was built on the expected transition from a land grab phase to a more efficient phase, which aims to monetize existing viewership by addressing issues such as ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) and password sharing among 100 million global users.

“With reports of slow AVOD adoption, recent ARM shortfalls signaling trade down, management signaling less margin expansion, and a lack of compelling 3P data on sub growth, we believe the risk/ reward for NFLX is balanced,” the analysts added.

Analysts at JPMorgan told investors in a note that the focus will be on the paid sharing progress, ad scale average revenue per membership (ARM) into Q4 and 2024, and operating margin trajectory.

""We remain positive on NFLX overall, but we recognize there is a growing list of questions into 3Q earnings w/the Street looking for more clarity around recent conference comments, ad business leadership changes, and whether a softer margin trajectory is coming from a position of competitive strength or slower growth (or both),"" the analysts said, who maintained a Buy rating and $455 price target on the stock.

The firm estimates NFLX will have cumulative borrower monetization of 18 million by the end of 2022, 30 million by the end of 2024, and 37 million by the end of 2025. In addition, they estimate 10 million ad tier subscribers at the end of 2022, ""which would mean 20M+ MAUs/viewers, which could prove optimistic.""

Analysts at Citi, who maintained a Buy rating and $500 price target on the stock, said the set-up has three facets.

""First, the good news: Netflix continues to take share of video viewing and the ad tier still has significant upside potential. Second, the neutral news: We expect Netflix to report results in line with the Street on all key metrics. Third, the bad news: consensus estimates for 4Q23 and 2024 may need to come down for revenues and margins,"" the analysts explained.

""To us, this suggests bearish tactical positioning may be reasonable. But, once sell-side estimates get reset, we believe Netflix remains a compelling Buy as rivals increase pricing and moderate content spending opening up a window for Netflix to distance itself from rivals,"" they added."

In terms of the upcoming earnings report, we expect Netflix to report above Street modeled subscriber performance (based on the data contained in this preview); however, we expect outsized growth from these net adds to have an immaterial impact to ARM reflecting spindown activity and emerging markets growth.

Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cuts

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.

On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2022 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""

Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.

""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.

Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.

The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.

Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.

Netflix eyes price bump after actors strike: report

According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.

The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.

Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.





Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbers

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.

The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.

The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.

Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations & represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”

They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”

Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.

Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens grip

Starting recently, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.

The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.

Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.

2022-10-07, IANS,"HONOR 90 5G: Shakes up status quo in saturated Indian phone market; get it for as low as Rs 26,999",https://in.investing.com/news/honor-90-5g-shakes-up-status-quo-in-saturated-indian-phone-market-get-it-for-as-low-as-rs-26999-3840389,"New Delhi, Oct 7 (IANS) The saturated Indian smartphone market was waiting for a new entrant to shake up the status quo and HTech, a comprehensive solutions provider, has now brought HONOR 90 in India that not only breaks walnuts but sets new standards for comfortable viewing and creative freedom.Equipped with a stunning 200MP Main Camera featuring AI Vlog Master and industry-leading Quad-Curved Floating Display with 3840 Hz PWM Dimming technology, HONOR 90 5G packs groundbreaking hardware and software into one device.

The HONOR 90 5G device comes in two variants -- 12GB +512 GB and 8+256 GB, which, coupled with RAM Turbo, gives up to 5GB on 8GB RAM variant and 7GB on 12GB variant.

Let us see if this device can create ripples in the Indian market.

First of all, the all-new triple camera system consists of a 200MP Main Camera with a 1/1.4-inch sensor, which by prioritising excellence in clarity, HDR capabilities, and low-light performance, delivers outstanding photographic results.

The triple camera has a 12MP ultra-wide and macro camera with a 112-degree field of view and a 2MP Depth Camera that helps the camera gauge distances accurately.

This camera is supported with multi-frame fusion, noise reduction algorithm and pixel binning to give a light-capturing performance that is equivalent to large 2.24 micrometer pixels (16-in-1).

The 200MP main camera resulted in outstanding high dynamic range (HDR) photos and detailed, bright images even in low-light situations. For selfie lovers, Honor 90 sports a 50MP camera which helps capture good images.

With the Portrait Mode, you can effortlessly create exceptional portraits that have well-defined facial features, accurate skin tones and produce an authentic bokeh effect that naturally blends the background with the main subject.

To offer photographers greater flexibility, the Portrait Mode lets users capture photos at 2X zoom to produce results that better highlight subjects in frames.

Additionally, the smartphone harnesses the immense power of the processor to deliver 4K video recording at 30fps from all three cameras - 200 MP Main Camera, 12 MP Ultrawide Camera and 50 MP Selfie Camera.

While shooting in 4k, in one single take, users can smoothly transition between Main, Ultrawide, and front camera without stopping the 4k recording.

For vloggers, the device helps denoise audio, makes video mode recommendations, and comes with an AI Vlog Assistant that lets users generate a social media-ready 15-second video with just a few taps.

Furthermore, with omnidirectional noise reduction that has a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, you can capture solid and clear human voices and zero of the surrounding noise - close to that of a professional recorder.

Design-wise, HONOR 90 offers a slim 7.8mm thin design with 183g weight. It comes with gracefully quad-curved edges.

Honor 90 offers deeply reinforced glass, demonstrating exceptional robustness and enabling the curved display to withstand being dropped any number of times.

On the rear, HONOR 90 showcases the iconic N Series Dual Ring Design, featuring rounded contours that are crafted with cutting technique to create a dazzling gleam, thereby elevating its elegance to another level.

The device comes in three colours: Midnight Black, Emerald Green and Diamond . Equipped with a 6.7-inch Quad-Curved Floating Display, HONOR 90 supports a high resolution of 2664x1200, 100 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut and up to 1.07 billion colours.

The display supports a peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits, improving users' readability even under bright light. To alleviate eye fatigue, the display also features Dynamic Dimming, simulating natural light.

Additionally, it supports HONOR’s Circadian Night Display technology, which filters blue light and promotes melatonin secretion to naturally improve users’ nighttime sleep quality.

Honor 90 also supports HDR10+ and HDR certifications from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video.

On the battery front, it houses a 5000mAh battery for day-long usage. In our test, it gave up to 16-17 hours of life with occasional video streaming, social media, and daily work tasks.

With its Built-in AI power-saving technology, the device optimises battery performance and enhances efficiency, which enables maximum productivity even during intensive use.

The smartphone is powered by the Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ) Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 accelerated edition processor, which has 20 per cent better GPU performance and a 30 per cent better AI performance than the phone’s predecessor.

HONOR 90 runs on the latest Android 13-based MagicOS 7.1, and packs a punch with enhanced smart features like Magic Text, which provides a smart life experience and maximizes productivity.

The smartphone comes in two storage variants 8+256 GB and 12+512 GB priced at Rs 37,999 and Rs 39,999, respectively.

Having said that, it can be purchased at as low as Rs 26,999 and Rs 29,999, during the Amazon Great Indian Festival, starting October 8.

These offers can also be purchased at all mainline stores. These deals include the bank offers.

2022-10-06, IANS,Netflix yet to scale up India biz due to lack of local content: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-yet-to-scale-up-india-biz-due-to-lack-of-local-content-report-3839412,"San Francisco, Oct 6 (IANS) With about 65 lakh subscribers in the country at the moment, streaming major Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has reportedly ""not succeeded"" in scaling up its business in the key Indian market. Netflix’s slower growth in India is primarily owing to the lack of local content, TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing analysts at global asset management firm AllianceBernstein.

The analysts reportedly said that only ""12 per cent of the titles"" Netflix offers in India were local content.

In comparison, nearly 60 per cent of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video’s offerings were in domestic languages in the country. Prime Video has about 2 crore subscribers in India and Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers, said the report.

""Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video,"" write the analysts.

""India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,"" they added in a note.

Netflix was yet to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, a significant price reduction in subscription tiers in India helped Netflix grow engagement in the country by nearly 30 per cent (year on year) in the first quarter of 2022. Over time, Netflix has adapted our prices to meet local needs and to further deepen its penetration, it lowered prices in India by 20-60 per cent.

""These reductions -- combined with an improved slate -- helped grow engagement in India by nearly 30 per cent year on year while F/X neutral revenue growth in 2022 accelerated to 24 per cent (versus 19 per cent in 2021),"" the company said in its quarter earnings report.

Streaming giant Netflix is reportedly planning to increase the price of its streaming service again -- starting with the US and Canada first -- to make up for the revenue lost during the Hollywood strike, a media report said.

Learning from the success in India, Netflix reduced prices in an additional 116 countries in Q1. Streaming giant Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

It also remains to be seen by how much will the price be hiked.

Over 15,000 television and film actors went on strike in July to demand higher pay and residual payments from streaming services.

The Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a union that represents around 160,000 actors, has been on strike after the union failed to reach an agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers regarding residuals and the use of AI.

They were following in the footsteps of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which has been on strike since May 2.

Last year, Netflix raised the prices of all of its plans, raising the ad-free Standard tier to $15.49 per month and the Premium plan to $19.99 per month.

The company also introduced a $6.99 per month ad-supported plan and later discontinued its $9.99 per month basic ad-free plan.

The company cracked down on password sharing earlier this year and began charging an additional $7.99 per month to share your account with someone outside your household.

2022-10-04, Investing.com,Netflix's potential price hike in Q4 seen as 'sooner than expected',https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-considers-raising-prices-after-actors-strike-ends--wsj-432SI-3835543,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is planning to raise the price of its ad-free streaming service after the ongoing Hollywood actors strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal.

While specific details of the price increase, including the amount and timing, have not been disclosed, discussions are expected to begin in the U.S. and Canada.

This move follows a broader trend in the streaming industry, where major ad-free services have increased prices by approximately 25% in the past year to improve profitability and encourage users to switch to cheaper ad-supported plans.

Netflix has been one of the few major streaming platforms that did not raise its prices over the past year. Instead, the company focused on increasing revenue by cracking down on password sharing.

The decision to raise prices is likely a response to the rising costs associated with labor agreements reached during the ongoing Hollywood strikes. The Writers Guild of America recently reached a tentative agreement with studios, and negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild, which went on strike in July, have resumed.

Netflix's move to raise prices is expected to occur once the strikes have been resolved, and it is part of a broader industry trend aimed at managing increased talent costs resulting from these labor agreements.

""While we already expected a price increase sometime in 2024, based off comments from 2Q earnings, a 4Q hike would be sooner than expected,"" Oppenheimer analysts commented.

""The price increase should increase ARM (rev/sub), either driving more subs to higher ARM ad-tier relative to ad-free Standard plan, or by increasing ad-free ARM. Either way, NFLX should be able to report higher revenue, after disappointing investors, with the stock -21% vs. NASDAQ's -9%, since reporting 2Q earnings on 7/19.""

The streaming giant has also modified its pricing tiers, discontinuing its basic ad-free tier in the U.S. and expanding the price gap between its standard ad-free plan and its ad-supported tier."

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Netflix to challenge $26 million tax demand in India,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-to-challenge-26-million-tax-demand-in-india-93CH-3833407,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ) Entertainment Services (India) LLP is expected to file an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal against a ₹196-crore ($26 million) tax demand. The move follows a ruling in favor of the Indian tax department by the Dispute Resolution Panel earlier this year. The tax department has accused Netflix of evading income tax in India, arguing that the streaming giant acted as a dependent agent permanent establishment of Netflix.

The tax demand is based on the company's operations from April to December 2020, during which it generated revenue above ₹1,145 crore ($154 million), with profits attributed to Indian operations calculated at ₹503 crore ($67.5 million). Netflix, with a market cap of $169.38 billion and a P/E ratio of 39.71 according to InvestingPro data, offered only ₹13.36 crore ($1.8 million) in taxes. The tax department asserts that the remainder of the profit, attributed to operations carried out of India through a permanent establishment arrangement, is taxable in India and amounts to ₹490 crore ($65.7 million), leading to the disputed tax demand of Rs 196 crore.

A Netflix spokesperson stated, “We fully adhere to tax laws and their requirements globally,” but did not provide further details on the case.

The tax department additionally argued that Netflix's Open Connect Appliance (OCA), a content distribution network developed by the company to deliver its TV shows and movies, was based out of India and thus liable for taxes there.

India is a significant market for Netflix, contributing the highest net subscriber additions globally in 2022, driven by an aggressive pricing plan launched in December 2021. According to an EY media report, India is the world's largest market by time spent on over-the-top services, with subscription revenues for this market projected to reach $3 billion by 2024.

In response to digital companies earning revenues through large user bases without paying taxes in the country, India introduced a 'Google (NASDAQ: ) tax' on digital advertisements in 2016 and expanded it in 2020 to include e-commerce supplies or services. Netflix's ongoing tax dispute reflects the complexities of this evolving taxation landscape.

As a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, Netflix has been experiencing slowing revenue growth recently, based on InvestingPro Tips. The company's revenue growth was reported at 3.53% for LTM2022.Q2. Despite trading at a high earnings multiple, the stock has fared poorly over the last month, with a 1-month price total return of -13.54%.

Tesla's delivery miss, newest price cuts

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) on Monday missed EV delivery estimates after summer upgrades to its factories, reporting 435,059 vehicles in Q3 vs. Wall Street expectations for 456,722.

On the production side, the EV giant manufactured a total of 430,488 vehicles during the quarter, below the estimate of 461,992. Tesla said it expected a drop from Q2 as it made upgrades to facilities, adding, ""Our 2022 volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles remains unchanged.""

Wedbush Securities, which has an Outperform rating on Tesla shares, blamed the miss on longer-than-expected downtimes of factories in Shanghai and Austin, Texas, that it says forced the shift of some 20,000 units into the fourth quarter, based on its estimates.

""We believe Tesla is now set to be entering the next stage of growth for the company globally with the Model 3 refresh front and center in China and Cybertruck production set to kick off beginning around Halloween,"" Wedbush said in a note on Monday, calling them tailwinds for the stock going into the next year.

Later in the week, the company also announced it would once again reduce prices on some of its popular EVs in the US, cutting its price on the Model 3 sedan to $38,990 from $40,240, and on its long-range Model 3 to $45,990 from the prior $47,240.

The performance model's price tag has been reduced to $50,990 from $53,240, and the Model Y performance sport utility vehicle saw a price reduction to $52,490 from $54,490.

Tesla shares initially took a hit on both of these pieces of news, but ultimately gained ground for the full week, rising 6.4% to $260.53 from Monday's open. Shares are also up some 140% year to date.

Netflix eyes price bump after actors strike: report

According to The Wall Street Journal, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) plans to again hike the price of its ad-free service in several markets globally just a few months after the Hollywood actors' strike ends.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price bumps in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.

The move would come amid a number of price hikes among streaming companies as they aim to improve profitability without alienating customers, with the WSJ calculating a 25% rise in major ad-free streaming services over the past year.

Netflix was up 1.2% for the week to $381.51 from Monday's open.





Rivian sinks on debt offering and preliminary numbers

Shares of Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: ) plunged some 23% Thursday after the EV maker announced a $1.5 billion green convertible senior unsecured note offering the previous night, along with disappointing preliminary Q3 results.

The debt offering, expected to extend the company's cash runway through 2025, includes an option for an additional $225 million. The notes can be redeemed for cash between October 2027 and September 2030, subject to specific share price performance conditions.

The company also said it currently expects Q3 sales to come in between $1.29B and $1.33B, slightly below market expectations.

Still, Truist remains bullish with a Buy rating and $30 price target on the stock, writing that the announcement ""largely falls in line with expectations & represents RIVN's strategy of continued opportunistic capital raises.”

They did add that they would not be surprised by a pullback, but added, ""with most of the unknowns out of the way, we see an increasingly positive setup into the 3Q print.”

Overall, the shares lost 20.7% for the week to $18.92 from Monday's opening price.

Apple changing App Store rules as China tightens grip

Starting recently, Apple (NASDAQ: ) is now mandating that new apps must provide proof of a Chinese government license before they can be published on its platform.

The move aligns Apple with local competitors that had already adopted this policy years ago to comply with China's increasingly strict regulatory environment.

Obtaining the newly required ""internet content provider (ICP) filing"" license typically involves having a presence in China or collaborating with a local publisher, posing challenges for numerous foreign app developers.

Apple had previously maintained a more lenient approach to ICP filings, which allowed it to offer a more extensive selection of mobile apps compared to local rivals and contributed to Apple's popularity in China, its third-largest market.

Shares are up 3.7% to $177.49 for the week vs. its Monday open.

The HONOR 90 5G device comes in two variants -- 12GB +512 GB and 8+256 GB, which, coupled with RAM Turbo, gives up to 5GB on 8GB RAM variant and 7GB on 12GB variant.

Let us see if this device can create ripples in the Indian market.

First of all, the all-new triple camera system consists of a 200MP Main Camera with a 1/1.4-inch sensor, which by prioritising excellence in clarity, HDR capabilities, and low-light performance, delivers outstanding photographic results.

The triple camera has a 12MP ultra-wide and macro camera with a 112-degree field of view and a 2MP Depth Camera that helps the camera gauge distances accurately.

This camera is supported with multi-frame fusion, noise reduction algorithm and pixel binning to give a light-capturing performance that is equivalent to large 2.24 micrometer pixels (16-in-1).

The 200MP main camera resulted in outstanding high dynamic range (HDR) photos and detailed, bright images even in low-light situations. For selfie lovers, Honor 90 sports a 50MP camera which helps capture good images.

With the Portrait Mode, you can effortlessly create exceptional portraits that have well-defined facial features, accurate skin tones and produce an authentic bokeh effect that naturally blends the background with the main subject.

To offer photographers greater flexibility, the Portrait Mode lets users capture photos at 2X zoom to produce results that better highlight subjects in frames.

Additionally, the smartphone harnesses the immense power of the processor to deliver 4K video recording at 30fps from all three cameras - 200 MP Main Camera, 12 MP Ultrawide Camera and 50 MP Selfie Camera.

While shooting in 4k, in one single take, users can smoothly transition between Main, Ultrawide, and front camera without stopping the 4k recording.

For vloggers, the device helps denoise audio, makes video mode recommendations, and comes with an AI Vlog Assistant that lets users generate a social media-ready 15-second video with just a few taps.

Furthermore, with omnidirectional noise reduction that has a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, you can capture solid and clear human voices and zero of the surrounding noise - close to that of a professional recorder.

Design-wise, HONOR 90 offers a slim 7.8mm thin design with 183g weight. It comes with gracefully quad-curved edges.

Honor 90 offers deeply reinforced glass, demonstrating exceptional robustness and enabling the curved display to withstand being dropped any number of times.

On the rear, HONOR 90 showcases the iconic N Series Dual Ring Design, featuring rounded contours that are crafted with cutting technique to create a dazzling gleam, thereby elevating its elegance to another level.

The device comes in three colours: Midnight Black, Emerald Green and Diamond . Equipped with a 6.7-inch Quad-Curved Floating Display, HONOR 90 supports a high resolution of 2664x1200, 100 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut and up to 1.07 billion colours.

The display supports a peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits, improving users' readability even under bright light. To alleviate eye fatigue, the display also features Dynamic Dimming, simulating natural light.

Additionally, it supports HONOR’s Circadian Night Display technology, which filters blue light and promotes melatonin secretion to naturally improve users’ nighttime sleep quality.

2022-10-06, IANS,Netflix yet to scale up India biz due to lack of local content: Report,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-yet-to-scale-up-india-biz-due-to-lack-of-local-content-report-3839412,"San Francisco, Oct 6 (IANS) With about 65 lakh subscribers in the country at the moment, streaming major Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has reportedly ""not succeeded"" in scaling up its business in the key Indian market. Netflix’s slower growth in India is primarily owing to the lack of local content, TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing analysts at global asset management firm AllianceBernstein.

The analysts reportedly said that only ""12 per cent of the titles"" Netflix offers in India were local content.

In comparison, nearly 60 per cent of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) Prime Video’s offerings were in domestic languages in the country. Prime Video has about 2 crore subscribers in India and Disney+ Hotstar continues to dominate the market with over 40 million subscribers, said the report.

""Perhaps the lesson from India points to both the need for higher density of local-language content, but also a recognition that in many emerging markets, value is less tied to a comparison with other streaming services and more tied to a much lower cost of linear TV or Internet video,"" write the analysts.

""India, for example, is likely YouTube’s largest market, and a key growth area for social media names,"" they added in a note.

Netflix was yet to comment on the report.

Meanwhile, a significant price reduction in subscription tiers in India helped Netflix grow engagement in the country by nearly 30 per cent (year on year) in the first quarter of 2022. Over time, Netflix has adapted our prices to meet local needs and to further deepen its penetration, it lowered prices in India by 20-60 per cent.

""These reductions -- combined with an improved slate -- helped grow engagement in India by nearly 30 per cent year on year while F/X neutral revenue growth in 2022 accelerated to 24 per cent (versus 19 per cent in 2021),"" the company said in its quarter earnings report.

Streaming giant Netflix is reportedly planning to increase the price of its streaming service again -- starting with the US and Canada first -- to make up for the revenue lost during the Hollywood strike, a media report said.

Learning from the success in India, Netflix reduced prices in an additional 116 countries in Q1. Streaming giant Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

The analyst comments: ""We are initiating coverage of Netflix (NFLX) with a Buy rating and a $482 PT – there are tailwinds from its early-stage successful rollout of its crack down on password sharing, with optionality on the size of the advertising opportunity supporting growth hopes (and valuation), but it trades much more expensively with similar growth to other media conglomerates, although we acknowledge the ad opportunity could be worth $79-$292/sh on an NPV when normalized."""

We are below consensus on subscriber growth, especially in international markets, but offset by a more positive view on ARM growth, based not only on price hikes but also AVOD growth.

Revenues of $459.3 million missed projections of $473.37 million, primarily due to the decrease in the net average selling price for conventional eggs.

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

It also remains to be seen by how much will the price be hiked.

Over 15,000 television and film actors went on strike in July to demand higher pay and residual payments from streaming services.

The Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, a union that represents around 160,000 actors, has been on strike after the union failed to reach an agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers regarding residuals and the use of AI.

They were following in the footsteps of the Writers Guild of America (WGA), which has been on strike since May 2.

Last year, Netflix raised the prices of all of its plans, raising the ad-free Standard tier to $15.49 per month and the Premium plan to $19.99 per month.

The company also introduced a $6.99 per month ad-supported plan and later discontinued its $9.99 per month basic ad-free plan.

The company cracked down on password sharing earlier this year and began charging an additional $7.99 per month to share your account with someone outside your household.

2022-10-04, Investing.com,Netflix's potential price hike in Q4 seen as 'sooner than expected',https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-considers-raising-prices-after-actors-strike-ends--wsj-432SI-3835543,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is planning to raise the price of its ad-free streaming service after the ongoing Hollywood actors strike concludes, according to the Wall Street Journal.

While specific details of the price increase, including the amount and timing, have not been disclosed, discussions are expected to begin in the U.S. and Canada.

This move follows a broader trend in the streaming industry, where major ad-free services have increased prices by approximately 25% in the past year to improve profitability and encourage users to switch to cheaper ad-supported plans.

Netflix has been one of the few major streaming platforms that did not raise its prices over the past year. Instead, the company focused on increasing revenue by cracking down on password sharing.

The decision to raise prices is likely a response to the rising costs associated with labor agreements reached during the ongoing Hollywood strikes. The Writers Guild of America recently reached a tentative agreement with studios, and negotiations with the Screen Actors Guild, which went on strike in July, have resumed.

Netflix's move to raise prices is expected to occur once the strikes have been resolved, and it is part of a broader industry trend aimed at managing increased talent costs resulting from these labor agreements.

""While we already expected a price increase sometime in 2024, based off comments from 2Q earnings, a 4Q hike would be sooner than expected,"" Oppenheimer analysts commented.

""The price increase should increase ARM (rev/sub), either driving more subs to higher ARM ad-tier relative to ad-free Standard plan, or by increasing ad-free ARM. Either way, NFLX should be able to report higher revenue, after disappointing investors, with the stock -21% vs. NASDAQ's -9%, since reporting 2Q earnings on 7/19.""

The streaming giant has also modified its pricing tiers, discontinuing its basic ad-free tier in the U.S. and expanding the price gap between its standard ad-free plan and its ad-supported tier."

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said it believes Netflix will likely begin the price rises in the US and Canada, although they are unsure how much the price will be lifted by or when they will take effect.

As streaming companies aim for improved profitability, the WSJ calculates that over the past year, the price of major ad-free streaming services has risen by about 25%.

2022-10-03, Investing.com,Netflix to challenge $26 million tax demand in India,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-to-challenge-26-million-tax-demand-in-india-93CH-3833407,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ) Entertainment Services (India) LLP is expected to file an appeal before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal against a ₹196-crore ($26 million) tax demand. The move follows a ruling in favor of the Indian tax department by the Dispute Resolution Panel earlier this year. The tax department has accused Netflix of evading income tax in India, arguing that the streaming giant acted as a dependent agent permanent establishment of Netflix.

The tax demand is based on the company's operations from April to December 2020, during which it generated revenue above ₹1,145 crore ($154 million), with profits attributed to Indian operations calculated at ₹503 crore ($67.5 million). Netflix, with a market cap of $169.38 billion and a P/E ratio of 39.71 according to InvestingPro data, offered only ₹13.36 crore ($1.8 million) in taxes. The tax department asserts that the remainder of the profit, attributed to operations carried out of India through a permanent establishment arrangement, is taxable in India and amounts to ₹490 crore ($65.7 million), leading to the disputed tax demand of Rs 196 crore.

A Netflix spokesperson stated, “We fully adhere to tax laws and their requirements globally,” but did not provide further details on the case.

The tax department additionally argued that Netflix's Open Connect Appliance (OCA), a content distribution network developed by the company to deliver its TV shows and movies, was based out of India and thus liable for taxes there.

India is a significant market for Netflix, contributing the highest net subscriber additions globally in 2022, driven by an aggressive pricing plan launched in December 2021. According to an EY media report, India is the world's largest market by time spent on over-the-top services, with subscription revenues for this market projected to reach $3 billion by 2024.

In response to digital companies earning revenues through large user bases without paying taxes in the country, India introduced a 'Google (NASDAQ: ) tax' on digital advertisements in 2016 and expanded it in 2020 to include e-commerce supplies or services. Netflix's ongoing tax dispute reflects the complexities of this evolving taxation landscape.

As a prominent player in the Entertainment industry, Netflix has been experiencing slowing revenue growth recently, based on InvestingPro Tips. The company's revenue growth was reported at 3.53% for LTM2022.Q2. Despite trading at a high earnings multiple, the stock has fared poorly over the last month, with a 1-month price total return of -13.54%. However, the company's return over the last year was high, at 59.11%. For more insights like these, interested readers can check out InvestingPro which offers additional tips for informed investing.

2022-10-02, Investing.com,Rising content costs pressure streaming services to increase prices,https://in.investing.com/news/rising-content-costs-pressure-streaming-services-to-increase-prices-93CH-3832205,"Monday saw the rise of discontent among consumers due to the increasing prices of streaming services, with further price hikes anticipated. Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) recently raised the price of its Prime Instant Video service, adding ad breaks while offering users the option to pay more for an ad-free experience. Other media companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), are expected to follow this trend.

The Writers Guild of America secured an agreement earlier this week with studios to address concerns around compensation from streaming and the impact of artificial intelligence on their jobs. This significant victory for the writers signifies an impending increase in costs for studios and streaming services.

Simultaneously, sports rights fees, a key differentiator for many media companies' streaming services, are projected to rise from $19.8 billion in 2022 to $31.6 billion in 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts. As pay-TV distributors seem less willing to pay for sports networks, the cost of content continues to climb, putting pressure on media companies caught in a Catch-22 situation as consumers demand more high-quality content.

To keep pricing low, streaming services have introduced ad-supported tiers. While ad-free tier prices have increased, ad-supported tiers have largely remained the same. These tiers offer high long-term potential as they allow management to stabilize prices while increasing revenue per user by adjusting ad prices, user streaming minutes, or ads per minute of content.

However, ad prices dipped in 2022, with Netflix agreeing to lower prices with some advertisers in July and ad-supported streamers reducing their ad prices by 5% to 10% at this summer's Upfronts according to a Digiday report. These lower ad prices are exerting additional pressure on streamers' profits.

Investors have been urging media companies since last year to curb the losses incurred by their streaming services. With breakeven projections set for next year, price increases are seen as the quickest way to boost revenue without escalating costs. However, this may lead to customer cancellations and difficulties in acquiring new customers in a market already grappling with significant subscriber churn.

Streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix, which offer differentiated services, are expected to thrive despite these challenges. Amazon benefits from its Prime ecosystem, including its fast shipping service, while Netflix's wide-ranging content and superior technology appeal to a broad global audience.

However, smaller streaming companies might struggle and will need to find better ways to retain customers, possibly through bundling or reverting to more licensing revenue over direct-to-consumer approaches. For investors interested in streaming, the pricing power of a media company's streaming service is a crucial factor in their investment decision. Despite the challenges, Netflix remains one of the most appealing streaming service stocks as it manages costs and capitalizes on scale.

2022-09-30, IANS,Netflix ends subscriber-based DVD rental service,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-ends-subscriberbased-dvd-rental-service-3830907,"San Francisco, Sep 30 (IANS) Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has ended its subscriber-based DVD rental service after mailing its final DVD rentals on September 29. ""Netflix will mail its final DVD on September 29, 2022. But the red envelope remains an enduring symbol of our love of entertainment,"" Netflix wrote on X on Friday.

In April, the streaming giant announced to shut down its DVD rental business on September 29, saying the declining demand for physical rentals is making it ""increasingly difficult"" to provide the desired level of service.

Since shipping its first disc (Beetlejuice) in 1998, the company has shipped 5.2 billion films in those red envelopes to over 40 million customers, according to Engadget.

In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming on-demand, which quickly grew to become the company's most popular offering by 2009.

The rest is history, as Netflix gradually expanded to create its own streaming content and now has over 238 million subscribers.

While this is the end of an era, there is one silver lining.

In August, Netflix announced that anyone who still has a rental disc will be able to keep it and that they can even request up to 10 more films to help the company clear out its stock.

""We are not charging for any unreturned discs after 9/29. Please enjoy your final shipments for as long as you like!,"" Netflix said.

Meanwhile, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

In May, the company launched paid sharing in more than 100 countries, representing more than 80 per cent of its revenue base.

The company notified subscribers of the change via email, which Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at during an earnings call in August, reports Engadget.

Disney in the updated Subscriber Agreement, specified that a household includes only “the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence"" and used by the people who live there.

The agreement also suggested that Disney+ will introduce new fee options for users who want to add outside members to their accounts, noting that the upcoming rule applies to everyone “unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier”.

The company is following in the footsteps of Netflix, which officially began cracking down on password sharing in the US and other countries in May. The details have not been released yet. However, Netflix has set a precedent with its $8 per extra person, per month charges.

On November 1, Disney+ subscribers in Canada and parts of Europe will gain access to the streaming service's less expensive ad-supported tier, which has been available in the US since 2022, the report said.

Last week, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) announced that it will introduce 'limited advertisements' to its Prime Video streaming service in 2024 as it aims to put more cash into creating TV shows and films. In addition, the company said it will roll out the ""ad-free"" subscription tier for an extra $2.99 per month for Prime members in the US -- a similar move which was taken by competitors such as Disney+ and Netflix.

The patent is related to high-efficiency video coding (HEVC/H.265), a crucial technology for high-quality video transmission. This decision marks a significant milestone in an ongoing dispute between the two companies that began in 2018.

Broadcom accused Netflix of infringing multiple patents related to video streaming services in the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands. The specific European patent that formed the basis of this recent ruling is EP 2 575 366, known as the “366 Patent.” This patent covers fundamental features of digital video processing widely used in HEVC/H.265 video coding.

The court found that Netflix violated the '366 Patent by transmitting HEVC video, a technology Netflix extensively employs to provide Ultra HD content to its user base. As a result of the ruling, the court issued an injunction requiring Netflix to cease and desist all further infringement activities within Germany. This injunction restricts Netflix from utilizing Broadcom’s patented technology in certain video streaming services.

Mark Terrano, Vice President and General Manager of Broadcom’s Intellectual Property and Licensing Division, expressed satisfaction with the court’s ruling. ""Netflix has built a robust video streaming business that relies on Broadcom's patented technology to deliver content to its users, and Broadcom is pleased to see this recognized by the German court,"" Terrano said.

Netflix has not yet responded to the ruling. This legal development is expected to have significant implications for both companies and could potentially reshape aspects of the broader tech and entertainment industry.

2022-09-25, Investing.com,US Dollar Peaks Amid Inflation Concerns; Stocks Remain Steady,https://in.investing.com/news/us-dollar-peaks-amid-inflation-concerns-stocks-remain-steady-93CH-3822941,"Monday saw the U.S. Dollar reach its highest level since March, as investors sought safer options amidst speculation that central banks would maintain high interest rates to curb inflation. This development coincided with a decline in U.S. government bonds, while stocks remained steady.

The and the , heavily influenced by technology companies, showed little change following the worst weekly drop on Wall Street since March. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NASDAQ: ) saw a rise of 0.8% after reaching a preliminary labor agreement with Hollywood screenwriters. In contrast, Foot Locker Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ) and Nike Inc. (NYSE:NYSE: ) experienced a slump following a downgrade from Jefferies analysts due to anticipated consumer challenges.

A surge in the yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note by nine basis points marked a high of 4.53%, a level unseen since 2007. Concurrently, Bloomberg’s Dollar Spot Index increased for the fourth day in a row, nearing its highest point this year.

Traders are increasingly wary of the potential inflationary impact of rising oil prices, which could complicate efforts by policymakers to lower rates in the near future. Hedge funds have increased their exposure to oil, betting that shrinking supplies will drive demand.

Despite these concerns, Austan Goolsbee, head of the Fed Bank of Chicago, maintains that there is still a chance for the U.S. to avoid a recession. Last week, two U.S. Federal Reserve officials suggested that at least one more rate hike may be necessary and that borrowing costs might need to remain elevated for an extended period to bring inflation back to the target of two percent.

Increasing oil prices and a significant fiscal deficit are causing losses in government debt, pushing Treasury yields across all maturities to their highest levels in over ten years. Strategists at Bank of America Corp (NYSE: NYSE: ) predict that the Treasury may increase to 4.75% before risk sentiment and tighter financial conditions lead to a decrease towards year-end.

2022-09-25, Investing.com,Broadcom Announces Munich Court Rules Netflix Is Infringing Broadcom Video Patent; Imposes Injunction,https://in.investing.com/news/assorted/broadcom-announces-munich-court-rules-netflix-is-infringing-broadcom-video-patent-imposes-injunction-432SI-3822777,"Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: ) announced today that the District Court of Munich, Germany, ruled that Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is infringing a Broadcom patent related to HEVC/H.265 video coding. The court issued an injunction requiring Netflix to cease and desist all further infringement in Germany.

Since 2018, Netflix and Broadcom have been engaged in a wide-ranging patent dispute whereby Broadcom has accused Netflix of infringing numerous U.S., German, and Dutch patents through its provision of its video streaming service. The European patent at issue in this ruling, EP 2 575 366 (“‘366 Patent”), covers key features of digital video processing often used in HEVC/H.265 video coding. The court, on September 19, 2022, ruled that Netflix is infringing the ‘366 Patent through its transmission of HEVC video, which Netflix employs to provide Ultra HD content to its users. The resulting court-ordered injunction prohibits Netflix from providing certain video streaming services utilizing Broadcom’s patented technology.

“Netflix has built a robust video streaming business that relies on Broadcom’s patented technology to deliver content to its users, and Broadcom is pleased to see this recognized by the German court,” said Mark Terrano, vice president and general manager of Broadcom’s Intellectual Property and Licensing Division."
2022-10-02, Investing.com,Rising content costs pressure streaming services to increase prices,https://in.investing.com/news/rising-content-costs-pressure-streaming-services-to-increase-prices-93CH-3832205,"Monday saw the rise of discontent among consumers due to the increasing prices of streaming services, with further price hikes anticipated. Amazon (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ) recently raised the price of its Prime Instant Video service, adding ad breaks while offering users the option to pay more for an ad-free experience. Other media companies, including Netflix (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ), are expected to follow this trend.

The Writers Guild of America secured an agreement earlier this week with studios to address concerns around compensation from streaming and the impact of artificial intelligence on their jobs. This significant victory for the writers signifies an impending increase in costs for studios and streaming services.

Simultaneously, sports rights fees, a key differentiator for many media companies' streaming services, are projected to rise from $19.8 billion in 2022 to $31.6 billion in 2030, according to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts. As pay-TV distributors seem less willing to pay for sports networks, the cost of content continues to climb, putting pressure on media companies caught in a Catch-22 situation as consumers demand more high-quality content.

To keep pricing low, streaming services have introduced ad-supported tiers. While ad-free tier prices have increased, ad-supported tiers have largely remained the same. These tiers offer high long-term potential as they allow management to stabilize prices while increasing revenue per user by adjusting ad prices, user streaming minutes, or ads per minute of content.

However, ad prices dipped in 2022, with Netflix agreeing to lower prices with some advertisers in July and ad-supported streamers reducing their ad prices by 5% to 10% at this summer's Upfronts according to a Digiday report. These lower ad prices are exerting additional pressure on streamers' profits.

Investors have been urging media companies since last year to curb the losses incurred by their streaming services. With breakeven projections set for next year, price increases are seen as the quickest way to boost revenue without escalating costs. However, this may lead to customer cancellations and difficulties in acquiring new customers in a market already grappling with significant subscriber churn.

Streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix, which offer differentiated services, are expected to thrive despite these challenges. Amazon benefits from its Prime ecosystem, including its fast shipping service, while Netflix's wide-ranging content and superior technology appeal to a broad global audience.

However, smaller streaming companies might struggle and will need to find better ways to retain customers, possibly through bundling or reverting to more licensing revenue over direct-to-consumer approaches. For investors interested in streaming, the pricing power of a media company's streaming service is a crucial factor in their investment decision. Despite the challenges, Netflix remains one of the most appealing streaming service stocks as it manages costs and capitalizes on scale.

2022-09-30, IANS,Netflix ends subscriber-based DVD rental service,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-ends-subscriberbased-dvd-rental-service-3830907,"San Francisco, Sep 30 (IANS) Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has ended its subscriber-based DVD rental service after mailing its final DVD rentals on September 29. ""Netflix will mail its final DVD on September 29, 2022. But the red envelope remains an enduring symbol of our love of entertainment,"" Netflix wrote on X on Friday.

In April, the streaming giant announced to shut down its DVD rental business on September 29, saying the declining demand for physical rentals is making it ""increasingly difficult"" to provide the desired level of service.

Since shipping its first disc (Beetlejuice) in 1998, the company has shipped 5.2 billion films in those red envelopes to over 40 million customers, according to Engadget.

In 2007, Netflix introduced streaming on-demand, which quickly grew to become the company's most popular offering by 2009.

The rest is history, as Netflix gradually expanded to create its own streaming content and now has over 238 million subscribers.

While this is the end of an era, there is one silver lining.

In August, Netflix announced that anyone who still has a rental disc will be able to keep it and that they can even request up to 10 more films to help the company clear out its stock.

""We are not charging for any unreturned discs after 9/29. Please enjoy your final shipments for as long as you like!,"" Netflix said.

Meanwhile, Netflix added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

In May, the company launched paid sharing in more than 100 countries, representing more than 80 per cent of its revenue base.

The company notified subscribers of the change via email, which Disney CEO Bob Iger hinted at during an earnings call in August, reports Engadget.

Disney in the updated Subscriber Agreement, specified that a household includes only “the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence"" and used by the people who live there.

The agreement also suggested that Disney+ will introduce new fee options for users who want to add outside members to their accounts, noting that the upcoming rule applies to everyone “unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier”.

The company is following in the footsteps of Netflix, which officially began cracking down on password sharing in the US and other countries in May. The details have not been released yet. However, Netflix has set a precedent with its $8 per extra person, per month charges.

On November 1, Disney+ subscribers in Canada and parts of Europe will gain access to the streaming service's less expensive ad-supported tier, which has been available in the US since 2022, the report said.

Last week, Amazon (NASDAQ: ) announced that it will introduce 'limited advertisements' to its Prime Video streaming service in 2024 as it aims to put more cash into creating TV shows and films. In addition, the company said it will roll out the ""ad-free"" subscription tier for an extra $2.99 per month for Prime members in the US -- a similar move which was taken by competitors such as Disney+ and Netflix.

The patent is related to high-efficiency video coding (HEVC/H.265), a crucial technology for high-quality video transmission.

Broadcom accused Netflix of infringing multiple patents related to video streaming services in the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The two parties are scheduled to meet again on the same day, with hopes high for a resolution.

The dispute, which was initiated on May 2, 2022, has led to a significant halt in the production of television shows and movies. High-profile projects such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s Stranger Things, Disney's Blade, and Paramount's Evil have been notably affected by the work stoppages resulting from the strike.

The main point of contention in this dispute lies in the writers' demand for improved compensation. They argue that their current earnings do not adequately reflect the substantial revenue generated from streaming services.

Since the inception of the strike, studios have managed to save money due to halted productions. However, executives have warned that the absence of new content could eventually impact profits. This situation has raised concerns about potential financial implications if the dispute continues unresolved.

Both sides involved in this conflict have expressed a strong desire to reach an agreement soon. However, if no consensus is reached, there could be a potential extension of this industrial action until the end of 2022, as reported by CNBC.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Netflix: Evercore ISI lowers price target amid market concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-evercore-isi-lowers-price-target-amid-market-concerns-93CH-3813890,"In Monday morning trading, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares saw a slight increase of 0.2%, reaching $395.88, following a 10% drop last week. This modest rise brings the company's year-to-date gain to 35%. The drop in share price has been attributed to several factors, including the company's planned growth of operating margins, the nascent stage of its advertising revenue business, and the impact of ongoing Hollywood strikes.

The team of analysts from Evercore ISI, led by Mark Mahaney, maintained their Outperform rating on Netflix shares but reduced their price target to $500 from $550. They highlighted three key points made by Netflix at a recent conference. Firstly, the company plans to increase operating margins more slowly than 3% per year in the future. Secondly, its advertising revenue business is still in its early stages. Lastly, ongoing Hollywood strikes are negatively impacting the business.

Analysts predict that Netflix's content expenditure over the coming years will remain largely stable, leading to a slow increase in gross margins. However, they argue that the decision to grow operating margins more gradually lacks a firm strategy behind it. They speculate that additional margins might be allocated towards developing an ad-selling infrastructure or offsetting higher content costs.

Regarding advertising revenue, analysts noted an imbalance between demand and supply for Netflix ad space. They suggested that this issue could be resolved over time as recognition and selection of Netflix's ad-supported offering grows.

The Hollywood strikes present two significant challenges for Netflix. Firstly, they may lead to a gap in the company's content schedule. Secondly, they could delay potential price increases. Analysts anticipate that Netflix will raise its subscription prices but suggest that this should be accompanied by an improvement in content quality and quantity to provide better value for subscribers.

According to FactSet data, opinions on Netflix shares amongst Wall Street analysts are divided. 53% of analysts covering the shares have Buy ratings, 40% have Neutral ratings, and 7% have Sell ratings.

The analysts told investors the firm is taking a more gradual approach to the streaming giant, also lowering estimates for the company following recent management comments at an investor conference and very recent ad channel checks.

""At the risk of oversimplifying, we believe that three specific NFLX mngmt comments helped trigger a 10%+ stock tradeoff over the past week: 1) NFLX intends to grow operating margins' more gradually' than 3% a year going forward; 2) the advertising revenue business is still in the 'crawl of the crawl, walk, run stage;' and 3) the Hollywood strikes are 'bad for business,' the analysts wrote.

""We believe the pace of margin expansion for NFLX is being driven more by elective than structural factors, but we are reducing our Operating Margin expansion assumptions for '24 and '25 from 3% per year to 2% per year, which reduces our EPS estimates and PT,"" they added.

Evercore's latest channel checks show Netflix having a supply problem, not a demand issue, according to the analysts. However, they believe this will be addressed over time."
2022-09-18, Investing.com,Netflix's paid sharing strategy boosts subscriber growth and revenue potential,https://in.investing.com/news/netflixs-paid-sharing-strategy-boosts-subscriber-growth-and-revenue-potential-93CH-3813474,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ), on Monday, revealed that its paid sharing feature has started to deliver promising results. The company plans to roll out paid sharing across all operational countries, which is expected to fuel revenue growth in the latter half of the year.

The feature was introduced after successful trials in select Latin American countries and has since been expanded to over 100 countries. This expansion covers more than 80% of Netflix's revenue base and contributed to a substantial increase of 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.

During a recent investor conference hosted by Bank of America (NYSE: ), Netflix's CFO Spence Neumann highlighted the immense growth potential that lies ahead for the company. He noted that through paid sharing, Netflix could potentially convert over 100 million viewers into paid members. This represents a significant opportunity for monetization. In the U.S., for instance, Netflix charges $7.99 per month for paid sharing. Alternatively, password borrowers can opt for their own account with plans ranging from $6.99 per month (basic with ads) to $19.99 per month (premium).

Even if a small fraction of these 100 million free users convert to paid members, it would significantly impact Netflix's bottom line. For example, adding 10 million new members at $7.99 a month would generate $960 million in pure profit.

Neumann also clarified that the paid sharing rollout will span over the next few quarters, which should continue to drive growth in the user base.

The company also stands to benefit from global streaming growth due to its strong international presence and extensive local-language content. While operating margins are projected to be between 18% to 20% this year, similar to last year, Neumann believes there's potential for this figure to increase significantly, especially as content spending seems to have plateaued and even declined last year.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Netflix PT Lowered to $500 at Evercore ISI,https://in.investing.com/news/pro/netflix-inc-receives-investment-bank-analyst-rating-update-3813092,"(Updated - September 18, 2022 4:44 AM EDT)

Evercore ISI analyst lowered the price target on Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to $500.00 (from $550.00) while maintaining a Outperform rating.

The analyst comments ""We are maintaining our Outperform rating on NFLX, but lowering our estimates and price target in the wake of recent management comments at an investor conference and very recent ad channel checks. At the risk of oversimplifying, we believe that three specific NFLX mngmt comments helped triggered a 10%+ stock tradeoff over the past week: 1) NFLX intends to grow operating margins “more gradually” than 3% a year going forward; 2) the advertising revenue business is still in the “crawl of the crawl, walk, run stage;” and 3) the Hollywood strikes are “bad for business.” We believe the pace of margin expansion for NFLX is being driven more by elective than structural factors, but we are reducing our Operating Margin expansion assumptions for ’24 and ’25 from 3% per year to 2% per year, which reduces our EPS estimates and PT. ’25 GAAP EPS is reduced 7% from $20.82 to $19.32 and PT from $550 to $500, based in part on 26X our ’25 EPS estimate. Re the ads crawl comments, we didn’t find these surprising. Our latest channel checks show NFLX having a supply – not a demand – problem. But we believe this will be addressed over time. And on the Hollywood strikes, we 100% agree that these are negative for Netflix, tho less so than for other Streamers & studios."""

In August, Disney+ announced plans for an ad-supported service, while Netflix launched its ""basic with ads"" streaming plan last year. Prime members in the UK, the US, Germany and Canada will begin seeing advertisements early next year unless they pay an additional fee for an ""ad-free"" option.

""We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required for Prime members. We’re not making changes in 2024 to the current price of Prime membership. We will also offer a new ad-free option and will share the price of that option at a later date,"" Amazon said in a blogpost.

Later in 2024, the company said it would include ads in Prime Video across France, Italy, Spain, Mexico and Australia. Amazon stated that pricing for other countries will be announced at a later date.

""We will email Prime members several weeks before ads are introduced into Prime Video with information on how to sign up for the ad-free option if they would like,"" the company mentioned.

2022-09-21, Investing.com,Hollywood strike discussions continue between WGA and producers,https://in.investing.com/news/hollywood-strike-discussions-continue-between-wga-and-producers-93CH-3818691,"The Writers Guild of America (WGA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are continuing to negotiate in an effort to resolve the ongoing Hollywood strike that has lasted over three months, according to a joint statement issued on Thursday, September 21, 2022. The two parties are scheduled to meet again on the same day, with hopes high for a resolution.

The dispute, which was initiated on May 2, 2022, has led to a significant halt in the production of television shows and movies. High-profile projects such as Netflix (NASDAQ: )'s Stranger Things, Disney's Blade, and Paramount's Evil have been notably affected by the work stoppages resulting from the strike.

The main point of contention in this dispute lies in the writers' demand for improved compensation. They argue that their current earnings do not adequately reflect the substantial revenue generated from streaming services.

Since the inception of the strike, studios have managed to save money due to halted productions. However, executives have warned that the absence of new content could eventually impact profits. This situation has raised concerns about potential financial implications if the dispute continues unresolved.

Both sides involved in this conflict have expressed a strong desire to reach an agreement soon. However, if no consensus is reached, there could be a potential extension of this industrial action until the end of 2022, as reported by CNBC.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Netflix: Evercore ISI lowers price target amid market concerns,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-evercore-isi-lowers-price-target-amid-market-concerns-93CH-3813890,"In Monday morning trading, Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares saw a slight increase of 0.2%, reaching $395.88, following a 10% drop last week. This modest rise brings the company's year-to-date gain to 35%. The drop in share price has been attributed to several factors, including the company's planned growth of operating margins, the nascent stage of its advertising revenue business, and the impact of ongoing Hollywood strikes.

The team of analysts from Evercore ISI, led by Mark Mahaney, maintained their Outperform rating on Netflix shares but reduced their price target to $500 from $550. They highlighted three key points made by Netflix at a recent conference. Firstly, the company plans to increase operating margins more slowly than 3% per year in the future. Secondly, its advertising revenue business is still in its early stages. Lastly, ongoing Hollywood strikes are negatively impacting the business.

Analysts predict that Netflix's content expenditure over the coming years will remain largely stable, leading to a slow increase in gross margins. However, they argue that the decision to grow operating margins more gradually lacks a firm strategy behind it. They speculate that additional margins might be allocated towards developing an ad-selling infrastructure or offsetting higher content costs.

Regarding advertising revenue, analysts noted an imbalance between demand and supply for Netflix ad space. They suggested that this issue could be resolved over time as recognition and selection of Netflix's ad-supported offering grows.

The Hollywood strikes present two significant challenges for Netflix. Firstly, they may lead to a gap in the company's content schedule. Secondly, they could delay potential price increases. Analysts anticipate that Netflix will raise its subscription prices but suggest that this should be accompanied by an improvement in content quality and quantity to provide better value for subscribers.

According to FactSet data, opinions on Netflix shares amongst Wall Street analysts are divided. 53% of analysts covering the shares have Buy ratings, 40% have Neutral ratings, and 7% have Sell ratings.

The analysts told investors the firm is taking a more gradual approach to the streaming giant, also lowering estimates for the company following recent management comments at an investor conference and very recent ad channel checks.

2022-09-18, Investing.com,Netflix's paid sharing strategy boosts subscriber growth and revenue potential,https://in.investing.com/news/netflixs-paid-sharing-strategy-boosts-subscriber-growth-and-revenue-potential-93CH-3813474,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ), on Monday, revealed that its paid sharing feature has started to deliver promising results. The company plans to roll out paid sharing across all operational countries, which is expected to fuel revenue growth in the latter half of the year.

The feature was introduced after successful trials in select Latin American countries and has since been expanded to over 100 countries. This expansion covers more than 80% of Netflix's revenue base and contributed to a substantial increase of 5.9 million subscribers in the second quarter.

During a recent investor conference hosted by Bank of America (NYSE: ), Netflix's CFO Spence Neumann highlighted the immense growth potential that lies ahead for the company. He noted that through paid sharing, Netflix could potentially convert over 100 million viewers into paid members. This represents a significant opportunity for monetization. In the U.S., for instance, Netflix charges $7.99 per month for paid sharing. Alternatively, password borrowers can opt for their own account with plans ranging from $6.99 per month (basic with ads) to $19.99 per month (premium).

Even if a small fraction of these 100 million free users convert to paid members, it would significantly impact Netflix's bottom line. For example, adding 10 million new members at $7.99 a month would generate $960 million in pure profit.

Neumann also clarified that the paid sharing rollout will span over the next few quarters, which should continue to drive growth in the user base.

The company also stands to benefit from global streaming growth due to its strong international presence and extensive local-language content. While operating margins are projected to be between 18% to 20% this year, similar to last year, Neumann believes there's potential for this figure to increase significantly, especially as content spending seems to have plateaued and even declined last year.

2022-09-15, Investing.com,Netflix outlines growth strategies targeting revenue boost in 2024,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-outlines-growth-strategies-targeting-revenue-boost-in-2024-93CH-3811228,"Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) is charting a path to bolster its revenue growth in 2024 and beyond, according to recent insights from the company's Chief Financial Officer, Spencer Neumann. The CFO revealed two primary catalysts that are expected to stimulate the streaming titan's top-line growth, which has recently experienced a slowdown.

The second half of 2022 is projected to mark the commencement of accelerated growth for Netflix, as indicated by the company's management. This forecast comes in the wake of sluggish year-over-year growth rates for Netflix, which recorded 1.9%, 3.7%, and 2.7% for 4Q 2022 and the first and second quarters of 2022 respectively.

One key driver behind this anticipated growth is the continued implementation of a paid account-sharing strategy. This plan aims to monetize over 100 million users who currently borrow Netflix accounts by offering them ways to transfer their profiles, user experiences, and viewing preferences into paid subscriptions. However, the process is still in its formative stages and will unfold over several quarters.

Simultaneously, Netflix is set to tap into its emerging advertising business as another significant catalyst for revenue growth. Despite being in its early ""crawl"" phase, management sees this sector as a promising avenue for long-term growth. Advertising revenue is expected to constitute at least 10% of Netflix's overall revenue eventually.

With Netflix's trailing 12-month revenue exceeding $32 billion, the potential scale of its advertising business could be considerable. The year 2024 is slated to witness an expansion in Netflix's advertising capabilities coupled with a surge in advertiser demand.

However, it was highlighted that these future plans are not the sole drivers for boosting top-line growth. Management emphasized that they expect growth acceleration to kick off from the second half of 2022 itself, indicating that other strategies might also be in play.

Neumann told listeners that the company had over 100 million ""borrowers"" that were not paying for Netflix, but they had to address it to drive a ""sustained flywheel of healthy revenue growth.""

The company has seen a more muted cancel reaction as a result of the roll-out, as well as a better retention of its existing members. As a result, the streaming giant sees healthy characteristics going forward in terms of bringing on new paid members, both in terms of individual accounts and extra members.

The Netflix CFO also revealed that the password-sharing crackdown will continue to roll out across a few quarters.

When it comes to the streaming service's new ad-tier subscription, Neumann revealed there is a healthy mix of sign-ups across the various plans, although they skew slightly more towards ad-free accounts.

Neumann also believes the ability for advertisers to buy into the top ten titles is a positive. However, he feels the company's advertising build-out is still in its infancy, but the firm is confident in the long-term advertising opportunity being a big incremental revenue and profit contributor to the business.

Even so, the CFO acknowledged it would have to be built over time, with the company working on the scale and reach, with advertisers preferring a scaled solution. He commented that the company needs to work on better ad targeting and relevance capabilities.

Moving onto the company's operating margin, Neumann revealed that it peaked at 21%, but they have been managing in the roughly 18% to 20% range, although, it has started to tick up from last year. He acknowledged that it is best to grow the operating margin with revenue, although he noted it is not prudent for the company to keep growing at a 3% operating margin per year.

""Given our scale, now that we are at roughly 20% operating margin, I don't think it's really prudent for us to keep growing at three percentage points of margin per year. I think that would probably constrain the business too much,"" he commented.

This projection was shared at the recent Indonesia in View conference hosted by the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA) on Tuesday.

Key industry leaders expressed optimism about the market's growth. Tizar Patria, Senior Manager of Business Development for Netflix (NASDAQ: ) in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, highlighted the importance of content that resonates with local consumers. Clarissa Tanoesoedibjo, Managing Director of Vision+, emphasized the need for an ecosystem that supports all platforms, from pay TV to free-to-air and streaming.

Despite being Southeast Asia's largest video content market, Indonesia faces challenges. One of the key issues discussed at the conference was piracy. AVIA's Coalition Against Piracy's recent annual consumer surveys revealed that 54% of consumers in Indonesia access pirate services, making it the region's fourth highest incidence of piracy. To combat this, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between CAP and the Video Streaming Association of Indonesia (AVISI) on August 30. The agreement aims to combine resources to fight online piracy and protect Indonesia's creative and media industries.

The conference also focused on the monetization of premium video. Chris Mottershead, Commercial Director APAC at Publica, suggested that programmatic advertising could play a significant role in monetization due to changes in advertiser planning habits.

The event concluded with a keynote conversation with Hary Tanoesoedibjo, Executive Chairman of MNC Group. He outlined his plans to transform MNC Group into primarily a content and entertainment company by merging RCTI+ and Vision+ into one super app offering both free-to-air content and a premium subscription service. He also mentioned plans to sell the data infrastructure part of MNC Play while retaining the IPTV business.

Industry insiders agreed that supportive business models and a broadened skills base are essential for future growth. However, they also pointed out that Indonesia is currently the only country without a production incentive scheme, indicating more support is needed for industry expansion.

However, this is still less than the spike in subscribers Netflix witnessed in June, but comes as yet another sign that Netflix’s paid-sharing rollout is actually working.

The company saw a dip of over 25 per cent from its record-breaking June.

Moreover, the report said that nearly 23 per cent of Netflix sign-ups went to its ad-supported plan, up 4 points compared to June 2022, and the largest share of sign-ups since that plan's launch in November.

The company launched paid sharing in more than 100 countries in May, representing more than 80 per cent of its revenue base.

Meanwhile, Netflix said that it added 5.9 million subscribers globally in the second quarter (Q2), with the US and Canada making up 1.17 million new members in the April-June period.

""Revenue in each region is now higher than pre-launch, with sign-ups already exceeding cancellations. Paid net additions were 5.9 million in Q2,"" Netflix said in a statement, adding that its password-sharing crackdown is working.

The revenue was $8.2 billion (3 per cent increase year-on-year) and operating profit was $1.8 billion in the second quarter.

For Q3, the company forecasts revenue of $8.5 billion, up 7 per cent year over year.

Under the terms of a deal signed last year, Microsoft provides the streaming group with the technology to place ads on the platform. This service is key to Netflix's $6.99 ad-supported subscription option, which it rolled out in 2022 in a bid to help boost subscriber growth and combat fierce competition in the streaming sector.

The pact included an agreement from Microsoft that it would pay a so-called ""minimum guarantee,"" or a promise that it would deliver a large amount of ad revenue to Netflix. This, in turn, would cover some of Netflix's financial risk, according to the WSJ.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Netflix is now working with Microsoft to bring down the revenue guarantee. It added that some Netflix executives are frustrated that Microsoft has failed to sell more ad inventory. The company is also in preliminary discussions to sell ads through other partners, the WSJ reported.

Elsewhere, some ad buyers have recently agreed to pay Netflix around $39 to $45 for every 1,000 viewers, according to the WSJ. Previous reports in the paper said that the fee was previously roughly $45 to $55.

Neither Microsoft nor Netflix immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment."

Moreover, users can still visit the Home tab and other sections of the app to discover the full catalogue of series and films.

The more users interact with and tell Netflix what they like, the more they will see on the My Netflix tab.

Earlier this month, the company had updated the profile transfer feature to allow users to transfer their profile to an existing account.

The profile transfer feature allows users to transfer their personalised recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games and other preferences to another account.

Last week, the streaming giant had announced that it has ended password sharing in India and was alerting subscribers who were sharing their accounts outside their homes.

Netflix gets upgraded at Baird , following Q2 earnings

Baird upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $500.00 from $340.00, based on increased confidence in the company's execution of new initiatives such as advertising and paid sharing, as well as a stronger financial profile that is expected to improve investor sentiment over time.

The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue.

Near-term expectations seem better calibrated following the 2Q print - and in our view, the modest pullback has provided an attractive entry point into a strengthening long-term investment case.

That said, in our view “so far so good” with five sectors showing positive double digit earnings growth (energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services and real estate), three sectors posting positive single digit earnings growth (consumer staples, health care and financials), and two sectors delivering double digit negative earnings growth (materials and information technology),” Oppenheimer strategists said.

For Q2 2022, the blended earnings decline for the S&P 500 is -9.0%, which is higher than the expected earnings decline of 7%.

“The (blended) net profit margin for the S&P 500 for Q2 2022 is 11.1%, which is below the previous quarter’s net profit margin (11.5%), below the year-ago net profit margin (12.2%), and below the 5-year average (11.4%). If 11.1% is the actual net profit margin for the quarter, it will mark the sixth straight quarter in which the net profit margin for the index has declined year-over-year,” FactSet analysts wrote in a blog post on Friday.

Some of the most notable companies to report this week include General Electric (NYSE: ), General Motors (NYSE: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), AT&T (NYSE: ), Boeing (NYSE: ), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Wedbush analysts argue that Street’s focus is on Microsoft.

“The entire Street will be laser focused on one print this week: Microsoft. While this is a massive week for Big Tech earnings season there is no better barometer of the overall cloud and enterprise spending environment than Redmond and all eyes will be glued to the screens Tuesday after the bell,” they said in a client note.

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

Morgan Stanley analysts: “2022 has been a story of higher valuations than we expected amid falling inflation and cost-cutting. However, disinflation is now eating into sales growth, which means investor focus is likely to shift toward top line growers rather than just companies exhibiting cost efficiencies.”

Oppenheimer analysts: “We remain highly constructive on equities on expectations that economic fundamentals are likely to remain resilient if not robust in this period of significant transition tied to monetary policy. Corporations, the consumer and labor continue to reflect in our view resilience characteristic with a recovery process from a period of crisis and great uncertainty into a period of sustainable economic growth.”

Barclays analysts: “Valuations are up and earnings are in the hot seat as we enter the busiest weeks of summer reporting season. Estimates are heading lower for most sectors, while uncertainty is high for Big Tech. Two potential sources of downside: negative operating leverage worsened by faster disinflation, and China exposure.”

Berenberg analysts: “US equities look expensive in both absolute and relative terms compared to non-US equities. Equity bond yield gaps (excluding Japan) have compressed or even reversed in the last 12- 18 months. However, the gap between the US equity-bond yield gap and non-US yield gaps is near historical highs – this suggests more relative support for non-US equities versus local bonds than in the US. In absolute terms, US equities trade above a 12-month forward P/E of 20x for only the third time in the last 50 years; the last two times that US equities have been this expensive were both liquidity-fuelled bubbles.”

Goldman Sachs analysts: “We believe recent valuation expansion despite higher rates is reasonable considering the longer-term relationship between rates and equities, the improvement in expected growth, and the high market concentration in stocks benefiting from AI optimism. While our baseline forecast assumes a slight contraction in the S&P 500 P/E multiple to 19x by year-end, we believe risks to valuations are tilted to the upside if the multiples of laggards “catch up” or yields fall.”"

Earnings season kicks into top gear

Additionally, toymaker Mattel (NASDAQ: ) is set to receive a boost from the strong showing of the ""Barbie"" movie, which recorded the biggest domestic debut of 2022.

Fed meeting key in determining sentiment

2022-07-27, Investing.com,"Netflix reworking Microsoft deal, bringing down ad prices - WSJ",https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-reworking-microsoft-deal-bringing-down-ad-prices--wsj-3742082,"Investing.com -- Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is reworking the terms of its advertising partnership with tech giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ) and slashing ad prices, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.

Under the terms of a deal signed last year, Microsoft provides the streaming group with the technology to place ads on the platform. This service is key to Netflix's $6.99 ad-supported subscription option, which it rolled out in 2022 in a bid to help boost subscriber growth and combat fierce competition in the streaming sector.

The pact included an agreement from Microsoft that it would pay a so-called ""minimum guarantee,"" or a promise that it would deliver a large amount of ad revenue to Netflix. This, in turn, would cover some of Netflix's financial risk, according to the WSJ.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Netflix is now working with Microsoft to bring down the revenue guarantee. It added that some Netflix executives are frustrated that Microsoft has failed to sell more ad inventory. The company is also in preliminary discussions to sell ads through other partners, the WSJ reported.

Elsewhere, some ad buyers have recently agreed to pay Netflix around $39 to $45 for every 1,000 viewers, according to the WSJ. Previous reports in the paper said that the fee was previously roughly $45 to $55.

Neither Microsoft nor Netflix immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment."

Netflix gets upgraded at Baird , following Q2 earnings

Baird upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $500.00 from $340.00, based on increased confidence in the company's execution of new initiatives such as advertising and paid sharing, as well as a stronger financial profile that is expected to improve investor sentiment over time.

Last week, reported mixed Q2 , with EPS of $3.29 beating the consensus estimates, while revenues of $8.19 billion came in below expectations.

The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue.

Near-term expectations seem better calibrated following the 2Q print - and in our view, the modest pullback has provided an attractive entry point into a strengthening long-term investment case.

Shopify stock gains on upgrade

Shopify (NYSE: ) shares gained more than 2% pre-market today after MoffettNathanson upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $76.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro.

Lam Research (NASDAQ: ) shares rose more than 1.8% pre-market today after Stifel upgraded the company to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $725.00 from $505.00.

We view Lam as a prime near-and-longer term beneficiary of HBM-driven DRAM growth, and off rock bottom JunQ memory levels, see a path forward for Lam’s revenue trajectory to outperform consensus starting in calendar 2H.

Mega-caps take the stage

2022-07-24, Investing.com,Increased confidence in management fuels Baird to upgrade Netflix stock,https://in.investing.com/news/increased-confidence-in-management-fuels-baird-to-upgrade-netflix-stock-432SI-3735705,"Baird analysts upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares to Outperform with a price target hiked by $160 to $500 per share.

The rating change is fueled by Baird’s increased confidence in the company's execution, with a special focus on new initiatives like advertising and paid sharing. The analysts flag 5 reasons why they are more confident in Netflix’s management.

Commentary that ad-supported plans are generating peruser economics above Basic (ad-free) plans globally; Healthy early results from paid sharing; The decision to remove the Basic (ad-free) plan for new/returning users in key markets; Management’s acknowledgment that its broader pricing philosophy has not changed; Survey results show Netflix is maintaining its popularity among consumers.

“With near-term expectations better calibrated following the 2Q23 print, we think NFLX is entering a period of particular strength for the business, including: 1) significant revenue acceleration in 4Q23 and F24 as the benefits of paid sharing and advertising compound, 2) continued annual operating margin expansion given the high-margin nature of new revenue streams and the benefits of scale, 3) significant and growing FCF over the next few years, and 4) competitive advantages in the near-term as peers increasingly focus on profitability and navigate disruptions to content production, where NFLX may be relatively better positioned,” the analysts further noted in an upgrade note.

Although the valuation is “admittedly rich,” the analysts believe the rating change is justified, given the underlying momentum and unique qualities of the business.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the EV maker's recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.

But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.

As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.

The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Meanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.

However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.

Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.

Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.

But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:

Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.

Taiwan Semiconductor

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.

The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.

The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.

While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2022 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.

Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.

The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.

Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.

Microsoft

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.

After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product - Microsoft shares rocketed to a record high for the session.

Analysts were generally bullish on the news as well.

Barclays, for instance, called the move ""a major next step for MSFT’s AI monetization. We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""

BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""

Mizuho was also very positive, writing:

We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).

After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.

By 06:30 ET (10:30 GMT), the contract was up 55 points, or 0.2%, traded 14 points, or 0.3%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.5%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street closed in a mixed fashion Thursday, with the blue chip gaining over 160 points, or 0.5%. This was its ninth straight positive close and longest streak of increases since 2017, and its highest close since March 2022.

The tech-heavy , however, fell almost 300 points, or 2.1%, its largest one-day decline in over four months, weighed by poorly received results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and EV manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Positive earnings help sentiment

The earnings season has been largely beneficial so far, with 73% of the companies that have already reported exceeding analysts’ expectations, according to FactSet data.

Banks have dominated the first week, benefiting from rising interest rates, although the major lenders have had to cope with a slump in deal making.

Regional lenders like Comerica (NYSE: ) and Regions Financial Corporation (NYSE: ) end the week, along with credit card giant American Express (NYSE: ), but attention has largely switched to next week and numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Microsoft/Activision deal now more likely

The potential $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) now looks more likely to proceed after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the deal.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, but their opposition has been showing signs of softening.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

Fed meeting looms large

Away from the corporate sector, next week sees a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points.

Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle or signal more hikes ahead is likely to guide sentiment in the weeks ahead.

Oil rises on Chinese stimulus hopes

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, and raising expectations of more widespread support.

By 06:30 ET, the futures traded 1.3% higher at $76.63 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.3% to $80.64. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 1% this week.

Additionally, fell 0.3% to $1,965.75/oz, while traded largely unchanged at 1.1126.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"U.S. stock futures point higher, FTX sues Bankman-Fried - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stock-futures-point-higher-ftx-sues-bankmanfried--whats-moving-markets-3733004,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge up ahead of the final trading day of the week, with investors looking ahead to major tech earnings and a key Federal Reserve interest decision next week. Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

But gains have been tempered as traders exercised caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting. The has also rebounded from a 15-month low ahead of the gathering.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,4 big earnings hits: Tesla beats but shares sink; Netflix takes a slide,https://in.investing.com/news/4-big-earnings-hits-tesla-beats-but-shares-sink-netflix-takes-a-slide-3732851,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest earnings reports you may have missed this week and how analysts responded: numbers out of Tesla, Netflix, IBM, and Goldman Sachs.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) late Wednesday earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.

Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.

Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.

The price cuts helped the EV giant boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""

Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed : While EPS of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.

The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.

Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:

Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.

IBM

International Business Machines (NYSE: ) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.

IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2022 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.

UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2022 ""implied"" guidance.

BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday said plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.

Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.

The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.

Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.

Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"Asian stocks edge lower as markets weigh China stimulus, tech gloom",https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-edge-lower-as-markets-weigh-china-stimulus-tech-gloom-3732443,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Friday as investors weighed more Chinese stimulus measures against weakness in technology stocks after chipmaking giant TSMC presented a bleak outlook for the year.

China’s top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, unveiled new measures aimed at boosting spending in the automobile and consumer electronics sectors.

The move comes amid promises of more policy support from Beijing, after data showed that a Chinese economic recovery slowed sharply in the second quarter.

Chinese stocks recoup some weekly losses on stimulus cheer

Hong Kong’s index was the best performer in Asia, rising 0.7% on strength in locally-listed Chinese stocks.

But the and indexes traded sideways after relinquishing most early gains. All three indexes were still set to lose over 1% this week, although they did trim some weekly losses on Friday.

Fund managers were seen growing less optimistic over a Chinese economic recovery this year, amid weak indicators and limited policy support. Bank of America economists warned that local stocks could test 11-year lows as a post-COVID economic rebound runs out of steam.

Weakness in China bodes poorly for broader Asian markets, many of which depend on the country as a trading hub.

Asia tech under pressure from weak earnings outlook, Wall St losses

Broader Asian stocks were held back by weakness in heavyweight technology shares. An overnight slide in major U.S. technology stocks provided weak cues to markets, following disappointing results from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW: ) (NYSE: ), Asia’s most valuable company, sank 3% on Friday after the firm reported a 23% drop in its second-quarter profit, and also warned that its sales and profits were set to decline further this year.

TSMC was not alone in presenting a weak outlook. Hong Kong’s Sunny Optical Technology Group (HK: ), which manufactures smartphone components for several major brands, fell 1% after it flagged an as much as 70% profit decline in the first half of 2022.

Most tech-heavy Asian bourses retreated, with South Korea’s down 0.1%, while the index slid 0.7%.

Australia’s fell 0.3%, amid some concerns over slowing commodity demand in China.

Japan’s fell 0.1%, while the broader was flat as data showed that Japanese remained sticky through June - a trend that could attract policy tightening by the Bank of Japan.

On the other hand, Indian stocks continued to outperform this week, with the and indexes notching record highs for the past four sessions."

The rating change is fueled by Baird’s increased confidence in the company's execution, with a special focus on new initiatives like advertising and paid sharing. The analysts flag 5 reasons why they are more confident in Netflix’s management.

Commentary that ad-supported plans are generating peruser economics above Basic (ad-free) plans globally; Healthy early results from paid sharing; The decision to remove the Basic (ad-free) plan for new/returning users in key markets; Management’s acknowledgment that its broader pricing philosophy has not changed; Survey results show Netflix is maintaining its popularity among consumers.

“With near-term expectations better calibrated following the 2Q23 print, we think NFLX is entering a period of particular strength for the business, including: 1) significant revenue acceleration in 4Q23 and F24 as the benefits of paid sharing and advertising compound, 2) continued annual operating margin expansion given the high-margin nature of new revenue streams and the benefits of scale, 3) significant and growing FCF over the next few years, and 4) competitive advantages in the near-term as peers increasingly focus on profitability and navigate disruptions to content production, where NFLX may be relatively better positioned,” the analysts further noted in an upgrade note.

Although the valuation is “admittedly rich,” the analysts believe the rating change is justified, given the underlying momentum and unique qualities of the business.

Netflix shares are trading modestly higher in pre-market Monday."

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) shares took a dive this past week as investors fretted over the EV maker's recent price cuts to boost volumes and combat intensifying competition in the electric vehicle market. The decision pushed up to a record high of $24.93 billion during the three-month period.

But the move also weighed on its gross profit margin from automotive operations, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, which dropped to 18.2% from 18.8% in the first quarter and 26.2% last year. Although that decline was not as large as many analysts had expected, Tesla's stock still slumped after chief executive Elon Musk later suggested that more price reductions could be coming this year.

As far as the headline numbers go, Tesla reported EPS of $0.91 on revenue of $24.93 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.79 cents on revenue of $24.29B.

The price cuts helped the company boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with deliveries surging 86% to 466,140, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, and both BofA and Goldman Sachs - which said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain - reiterating their Neutral ratings on the stock.

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Meanwhile, Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) crackdown on password sharing between users - and its cheaper ad-supported tier - appear to be working, with the company seeing a ""low"" number of cancellations and adding 5.9 million subscribers in Q2 - well above Wall Street estimates.

However, this trend was overshadowed by softer-than-anticipated of $8.2B, even as EPS came in at a far better-than-expected $3.29 (vs. estimates for $2.84). Netflix's third-quarter projection of $8.5B for the top-line figure missed forecasts as well.

Co-CEO Greg Peters warned investors that returns from all of these initiatives would take ""several quarters"" to materialize.

Shares in Netflix took a slide, ending the week down 4% to $427.50.

But Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after what it called ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

Taiwan Semiconductor

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: ), or TSMC, on Thursday logged a higher-than-expected profit on some resilience in chip demand, but warned that a boom in artificial intelligence will not be enough to offset a broader industry downturn.

The New York-traded stock took a quick fall after the results, with American depositary receipts finishing the week down 7.1% to $97.25.

The firm - which is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, and also a key supplier to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) - said net Q2 earnings per share fell 23% to 7.01 Taiwan dollars (US$1 = T$31.07), or US$1.14 per ADR. The per-ADR figure came in easily above expectations for $1.07, per analysts polled by Investing.com.

While the year-on-year decline in profit was partially due to a strong performance last year, it also reflects a slowdown in semiconductor demand through 2022 amid rising interest rates and worsening global economic conditions.

Profitability is expected to worsen in the coming quarter, with the chipmaker's gross profit margin set to drop to 51.5% to 53.5% in the third quarter from 54.1% in the second quarter, while operating profit margin is also expected to decline to between 38% and 40% from 42%.

The firm said that it faced increased headwinds from a broader economic downturn, which was keeping chip demand subdued after a bumper 2022. TSMC also struck a less optimistic note on an artificial intelligence-driven boost to chip demand than some of its peers.

Following the results, research firm CFRA trimmed the company's rating to Buy from the prior Strong Buy.

Microsoft

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said 365 Copilot users would be charged $30 per month for Microsoft 365 E3, E5, Business Standard, and Business Premium when generally available.

After the announcement Tuesday - with higher-than-expected pricing for a very widely used product - Microsoft shares rocketed to a record high for the session.

We think the price uplift (53% over E5) is at the upper end of investors’ expectations and should drive shares.” Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) similarly said that the pricing ""represents a significant step-up to existing license costs.""

BofA, meanwhile, estimated this to represent a $1.52B opportunity based on its estimate of 422 million Office 365 subscribers and anticipation of 1% penetration into that user base. It also believes that ""M365 Copilot’s ability to parse through relevant business data"" is a ""critical differentiator to existing AI products.""

Mizuho was also very positive, writing:

We remain confident that MSFT's growth opportunities over the medium term and beyond are greater than many realize, and this includes significant Generative AI monetization. And among June-quarter companies about to report, MSFT remains our top pick. We reiterate our Buy rating and raise our PT to $420 (was $390).

After Tuesday's surge, shares retreated and ultimately ended down fractionally for the week to $343.77.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, but their opposition has been showing signs of softening.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

Fed meeting looms large

Away from the corporate sector, next week sees a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points.

Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle or signal more hikes ahead is likely to guide sentiment in the weeks ahead.

Oil rises on Chinese stimulus hopes

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at promoting local spending, and raising expectations of more widespread support.

By 06:30 ET, the futures traded 1.3% higher at $76.63 a barrel, while the contract climbed 1.3% to $80.64. Both contracts are on course for gains of around 1% this week.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"U.S. stock futures point higher, FTX sues Bankman-Fried - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-stock-futures-point-higher-ftx-sues-bankmanfried--whats-moving-markets-3733004,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures edge up ahead of the final trading day of the week, with investors looking ahead to major tech earnings and a key Federal Reserve interest decision next week. Elsewhere, FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and U.S. regulators withdraw a case before an in-house judge that was aiming to block the $69 billion merger between Microsoft and Activision Blizzard.

1. U.S. stock futures inch higher

U.S. stock futures pointed up Friday after earnings from Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) cast some doubt over a recent rally in tech stocks in the prior session.

At 05:03 ET (09:03 GMT), ticked up by 9 points or 0.19%, gained 32 points or 0.09%, and rose 59 points or 0.38%.

The tech-heavy slipped to its largest one-day decline in over four months on Thursday, dragged down by disappointing results from electric carmaker Tesla and streaming giant Netflix, while the benchmark also lost ground. Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has contributed heavily to a recent surge in tech stocks that has helped power a jump in stock markets this year.

The broad-based posted its ninth consecutive winning day, its longest streak of increases since 2017, buoyed in part by upbeat profit estimates from Johnson & Johnson. The 30-stock index also climbed to its highest close since March 2022.

2. American Express to report; tech titans ahead

Second quarter earnings season in the U.S. is set to temporarily slow Friday, following a batch of stronger-than-anticipated results from several major companies this week.

Credit card company American Express (NYSE: ) will feature on the earnings calendar before the start of the U.S. trading day, along with car retailer AutoNation (NYSE: ). According to FactSet data cited by CNBC, 73% of the S&P 500 firms that have already reported have beat analysts' estimates, fuelling hopes that the broader U.S. economy may be able to engineer a soft landing despite an unprecedented string of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Investors will have a chance next week to dive into the numbers from some of the country's biggest tech players, including traditional powerhouses like Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

Also looming in the background is a key policy decision from the , with the U.S. central bank widely expected to raise borrowing costs by another 25 basis points. Whether officials will then decide to back away from its long-standing tightening cycle remains to be seen.

3. FTX sues Bankman-Fried

Bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed a lawsuit against founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former top executives in a bid to recover over $1B in allegedly misappropriated funds.

Along with Bankman-Fried, the lawsuit named as defendants Caroline Ellison, who led FTX's trading arm Alameda Research, as well as former technology chief Zixiao ""Gary"" Wang and former engineering director Nishad Singh.

Turnaround expert John Ray, who replaced Bankman-Fried at the helm of FTX in November, and his executive team claim that the defendants committed ""one of the largest financial frauds in history"" by misusing funds to finance bonuses, luxury real estate, and speculative investments. Ray -- widely known as the overseer of energy giant Enron's liquidation -- is arguing that the money belongs to FTX's creditors, including thousands of customers who were unable to access their assets after the group suspended withdrawals last year.

A spokesman for Bankman-Fried, who also faces criminal charges from U.S. prosecutors, declined a request to comment from Reuters. Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

4. FTC withdraws in-house challenge to Microsoft-Activision mega-merger

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has suspended its request for an in-house judge to block the $69B tie-up of Microsoft and video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ), bringing the deal one step closer to completion.

An FTC administrative law judge was supposed to have heard the case on Aug. 2, but the agency chose on Thursday to put this particular attack against the merger on hold. However, the FTC could still re-file the challenge at a later date.

Regulators in both the U.S. and Britain have expressed worries over how the merger may impact competition, arguing that Microsoft could make ""Call of Duty"" exclusive to its Xbox console and, in effect, muscle out rival platforms.

But their opposition has been showing signs of softening. A U.S. federal judge and an appeals court rejected a separate FTC injunction request last week. The U.K.'s competition watchdog, which previously blocked the deal, subsequently said it was once again open to hearing Microsoft's remedies to its concerns.

Microsoft and Activision have now extended the deadline to wrap up the transaction to Oct. 18.

5. Oil rises on hopes for more Chinese stimulus

Crude prices rose Friday, closing a volatile week with gains on rising hopes that China, the world’s largest crude importer, will roll out more stimulus measures to support its stuttering economic recovery.

The country revealed disappointing second quarter growth numbers earlier this week, prompting Beijing to unveil new measures on Friday aimed at lifting sales of cars and electronics to bolster economic activity.

But gains have been tempered as traders exercised caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting. The has also rebounded from a 15-month low ahead of the gathering.

By 05:04 ET, the futures traded 0.78% higher at $76.24 a barrel, while the contract climbed 0.74% to $80.23 per barrel."
2022-07-21, Investing.com,4 big earnings hits: Tesla beats but shares sink; Netflix takes a slide,https://in.investing.com/news/4-big-earnings-hits-tesla-beats-but-shares-sink-netflix-takes-a-slide-3732851,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest earnings reports you may have missed this week and how analysts responded: numbers out of Tesla, Netflix, IBM, and Goldman Sachs.

InvestingPro subscribers got this news in rapid fire. Never be left in the dust again.

Tesla

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) late Wednesday earnings of $0.91 per share - surpassing the $0.79 Wall Street consensus - on better-than-expected revenue of $24.93, and margins were also less bad than feared.

Still, shares sank 9.7% in Thursday trading.

Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins - which have been closely watched following recent price cuts on Tesla's electric vehicles - fell 6.8% to 18.2% in Q2 from the prior year, better than analysts' estimates of 16.9%.

The price cuts helped the EV giant boost its installed base and rake in new customers, with vehicle deliveries surging 86% to 466,140 EVs in Q2, marking a record quarter for the company.

Wedbush called the move a ""smart strategy,"" saying after the report that the price cuts ""have been in a homerun success in China, Europe, and the US… In a nutshell, we view Tesla where Apple was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time.""

Needham and Company reiterated its Hold rating due to valuation, adding that it leans ""more bullish when thinking about TSLA's positioning vs legacy [original equipment manufacturer] peers.""

Goldman Sachs said the report was ""solid"" but that headwinds remain, reiterating its Neutral rating on the stock. Bofa also reiterated Neutral given risks from price cuts, increasing competition, and near-term macro considerations - while also noting the positive factors of cost reduction and ""its ability to remain agile.""

Wells Fargo, meanwhile, said Tesla delivered ""a low quality"" EPS beat ""driven mostly by other income.""

Netflix

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) dropped 8.4% on Thursday, following mixed : While EPS of $3.29 came in better than the consensus of $2.84, revenue of $8.19 billion missed the consensus estimate of $8.27B.

The company added 5.9 million paid net subscribers in Q2 as it successfully rolled out paid sharing to more than 100 countries, representing over 80% of its total revenue. Buyside expectations were around 4M net subscriber additions.

Evercore ISI lifted the price target to $550 after ""a mother of a quarter"" and removed its Tactical Underperform rating on the stock. The firm blamed the move lower in shares on expectations correction, and not a fundamental correction, and ""would encourage investors to buy NFLX shares on this (small) pullback.""

BofA, meanwhile, bumped the price target by $35 to $525 per share on Buy-rated NFLX shares. The analysts said the results were ""healthy,"" adding:

Within the Media ecosystem, we believe NFLX’s depth/breadth of content positions them well to withstand the production reductions.

IBM

International Business Machines (NYSE: ) shares rose more than 2% after better-than-expected of $2.18 a share on below-par sales of $15.58B.

IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2022 constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. At current foreign exchange rates, currency is expected to be neutral to revenue growth.

UBS reiterated a Sell rating and a $110 per share price target on IBM stock, as the analysts believe the reiterated guidance bears a risk: They say they expect revenue to come in at the low end of the full-year 2022 ""implied"" guidance.

BofA, however, kept its Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target by $8 to $160 per share, saying, ""We believe the turnaround at IBM ([revenue] growth and [free cash flow] improvement) will continue. The company has a defensive portfolio, attractive dividend yield and an underappreciated AI portfolio.""

Goldman Sachs

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday said plunged 60% to $3.08 in Q2, missing estimates, on lower revenue of $10.89B that squeaked past consensus.

Still, shares ticked up by 1% in Wednesday trading.

The results were attributed to one-off charges related to the banking giant's home improvement lending group GreenSky and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios. Company top brass had already previously warned that this would be a challenging quarter.

Investment banking fees also dropped by 20% to $1.43B, which trading revenue from fixed income, currency, and commodities slipped by more than a fourth.

Like some of its banking rivals, Goldman's investment and trading business has suffered from a slowdown in dealmaking followed by a string of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes that have put pressure on the U.S. economy.

2022-07-21, Investing.com,"Asian stocks edge lower as markets weigh China stimulus, tech gloom",https://in.investing.com/news/asian-stocks-edge-lower-as-markets-weigh-china-stimulus-tech-gloom-3732443,"Investing.com -- Most Asian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Friday as investors weighed more Chinese stimulus measures against weakness in technology stocks after chipmaking giant TSMC presented a bleak outlook for the year.

China’s top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, unveiled new measures aimed at boosting spending in the automobile and consumer electronics sectors.

The move comes amid promises of more policy support from Beijing, after data showed that a Chinese economic recovery slowed sharply in the second quarter.

Chinese stocks recoup some weekly losses on stimulus cheer

Hong Kong’s index was the best performer in Asia, rising 0.7% on strength in locally-listed Chinese stocks.

But the and indexes traded sideways after relinquishing most early gains. All three indexes were still set to lose over 1% this week, although they did trim some weekly losses on Friday.

Fund managers were seen growing less optimistic over a Chinese economic recovery this year, amid weak indicators and limited policy support. Bank of America economists warned that local stocks could test 11-year lows as a post-COVID economic rebound runs out of steam.

Weakness in China bodes poorly for broader Asian markets, many of which depend on the country as a trading hub.

Asia tech under pressure from weak earnings outlook, Wall St losses

Broader Asian stocks were held back by weakness in heavyweight technology shares. An overnight slide in major U.S. technology stocks provided weak cues to markets, following disappointing results from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Tesla (NASDAQ: ).

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TW: ) (NYSE: ), Asia’s most valuable company, sank 3% on Friday after the firm reported a 23% drop in its second-quarter profit, and also warned that its sales and profits were set to decline further this year.

TSMC was not alone in presenting a weak outlook. Hong Kong’s Sunny Optical Technology Group (HK: ), which manufactures smartphone components for several major brands, fell 1% after it flagged an as much as 70% profit decline in the first half of 2022.

Most tech-heavy Asian bourses retreated, with South Korea’s down 0.1%, while the index slid 0.7%.

Australia’s fell 0.3%, amid some concerns over slowing commodity demand in China.

Japan’s fell 0.1%, while the broader was flat as data showed that Japanese remained sticky through June - a trend that could attract policy tightening by the Bank of Japan.

On the other hand, Indian stocks continued to outperform this week, with the and indexes notching record highs for the past four sessions."

Johnson & Johnson, IBM keep Dow win streak intact

International Business Machines (NYSE: ), a major Dow component, shrugged off the weakness in tech despite reporting as revenue fell short of Wall Street estimates.

Tesla slides as fresh margin worries overshadow Q2 results beat

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: ) reported second-quarter that beat Wall Street estimates, but fears of falling margins were renewed after Chief Executive Elon Musk said the electric vehicle maker would be willing to cut prices again should the economic backdrop deteriorate.

Still, the quarterly results from Tesla were a step in the ""right direction,"" Wedbush says, touting optimism over the EV maker's plan to licence its full self-driving software to other automakers.

""We view Tesla where Apple (NASDAQ: ) was in the 2008/2009 period as Cupertino was just starting to monetize its services and golden ecosystem with the Street not seeing the broader golden vision at the time,"" Wedbush said in a note as it lifted its price target on the stock to $350 from $300.

Netflix leads pain in Tech

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% as the streaming giant reported a second-quarter , though it added more subscribers than expected in the quarter.

The company's slow rollout of paid sharing, which bans members from sharing their subscriptions with users outside their household, was a ""surprise to investors,"" Oppenheimer said, and weighed on average revenue per membership.

But the slow pace of paid sharing rollout is likely to limit the impact to ""premium subscribers around seasonal usage, content launch, and impact of strike on linear TV in Sept,"" Oppenheimer added after lifting its target on the stock to $515 from $500.

Labor market remains tight

1. Goldman Sachs to round out bank earnings

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is set to unveil its latest returns on Wednesday, with some investors bracing for the Wall Street powerhouse to potentially report one of its weakest quarters ever.

A slowdown in stock and bond trading, as well as an expected drop in lucrative investment banking fees, are projected to have weighed heavily on Goldman over the last three months.

Recent results from the banking giant's closest rivals point to the impact of the dearth in dealmaking. On Tuesday, Goldman peer Morgan Stanley's (NYSE: ) second quarter revenue from sales and trading slipped by more than a fifth.

But analysts worry that Goldman faces other issues; namely, an anticipated write-down worth several hundred million dollars from its purchase of home improvement lending group GreenSky, and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios.

Chief executive David Solomon and other members of Goldman's management team have already flagged that this will be a challenging quarter. But just how bad it will be remains uncertain.

2. Tesla and Netflix ahead

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) are also among the biggest businesses on tap to report results Wednesday as the parade of second quarter earnings gathers speed.

For Tesla, the focus will likely center around the EV giant's gross margin, which analysts expect will slump to a ""trough"" following a series of price cuts aimed at boosting volumes and countering intensifying competition.

Tesla shares, however, have surged over the past three months thanks to solid delivery numbers and charging deals with legacy automakers like GM (NYSE: ) and Ford (NYSE: ). The stock has also been swept up in the enthusiasm around companies with exposure to artificial intelligence (AI).

Meanwhile, investors are curious to see how Netflix has fared after it launched a drive in May to crack down on password sharing between users.

The analysts, who have an Overweight rating and a $500 price target on the stock, stated in their second-quarter preview that they believe investors would buy a pullback on the long-term outlook for Netflix in the event of short-term pressure on the print.

Wells Fargo also raised some estimates for the stock.

""We found that the highest correlation was between Apptopia MAUs as a predictor of NFLX's EOP total subs. However, based on historical trends, the 3P MAU data tends to exceed the NFLX reported number by 100bps. When we adjust for this, we come up with 2Q net adds of 2.1mm, which is above Street's 1.8mm,"" wrote analysts.

""While we're raising our Q2 net adds from 1.5mm to 2.1mm to stick to our correlation, we think buyside is looking for closer to 4mm+, and rev growth of 5%+ y/y (vs. us at 4%),"" they added.

Wells Fargo also believes FX is turning into a tailwind for the company due to a weakening dollar.

""In Q2, FX turned into a tailwind for NFLX's print, mainly driven by a weakening dollar against the euro and BP. In addition, LatAm and APAC went from y/y MSD headwinds to around neutral. We estimate NFLX's y/y FX tailwind is now ~2% vs. constant currency, or roughly $180mm in positive translation. As a result, we are raising our 2Q rev estimate by ~$40mm to $8.3bn to account for the greater-than-expected benefit,"" the analysts explained."

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPMorgan analysts: “Since the relative high in May to early last week, Eurozone has lost 12% vs the US, in USD terms, and is trying to bounce. We believe there is another leg of underperformance ahead, and reiterate our moving the region to UW two months ago. This was partly given our view that Eurozone activity momentum was about to roll over.”

Roth MKM analysts: “We are starting to see minor negative divergences build on the top-down view of the S&P 500 but not enough to cause concern. There has been a swift improvement in sentiment as a chase mentality builds. Breadth was improved. The breakdown of the US dollar should provide tailwinds for stocks and commodities. The Materials sector should play catch up to the breakout in Industrials.”

Fairlead analysts: “The major indices pushed higher ahead of earnings season, allowing the SPX to reach the measured move projection of ~4510 last week from May’s breakout. Momentum gauges still point higher, suggesting the SPX may make progress toward minor resistance from early 2022 near 4600. However, we would be wary of any downturns noting signs of upside exhaustion have arisen for the SPX and NDX.”

BTIG analysts: “The major indices have gotten off to a strong start over the first half of July. Towards the end of last week, however, we started to see some signs of exhaustion and upside capitulation… With many names having rallied significantly over the last three months, we wouldn’t be surprised to see more of this over the coming weeks, which would be indicative of buyer exhaustion.”

Sevens Report analysts: “At current levels, the S&P 500 has priced in 1) No hard landing, 2) Falling inflation and 3) A Fed that won’t be raising rates much longer (and possibly cutting soon after). That’s basically the best outcome anyone could have hoped for at the start of the year, and that means the gains in stocks are legitimate, but also likely exhausted in the near term and it’ll take something else to push stocks materially higher from here.”"

By 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), the contract was down 80 points, or 0.2%, traded 6 points, or 0.1% lower, and dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street recorded a winning week last week, helped by softer-than-expected inflation data which advanced the theory that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle will reach its peak after a last increase next week.

The blue-chip gained 2.3%, its best weekly gain since March, while the broad-based rose 2.4%, and the tech-heavy jumped 3.3%.

NY Empire State manufacturing index due

The data slate is largely empty Monday, with only the scheduled for release. But the week includes such numbers as U.S. , and reports on , , and .

However, these numbers are unlikely to change the narrative that a 25-basis-point hike from the later this month is likely to be the last one in this cycle.

Data from China, released earlier Monday, showed that growth in the second-largest economy in the world was slowing sharply, casting further doubt over the country's nascent rebound from its COVID hit.

China's second-quarter increased by 0.8% from the prior three-month period, a significant cooling from 2.2% growth in the first quarter.

More banks, Tesla and Netflix set to report this week

Positive quarterly results from banking giants JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) add to last week’s positive sentiment, although peer Citigroup's (NYSE: ) profit tumbled by over a third.

More lenders are due to reveal their earnings this week, including Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).

These numbers are likely to come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the failure of several regional rivals earlier this year, an event that plunged the financial services industry into crisis.

Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ), streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) are also among the key businesses scheduled to report this week.

Tesla completes Cybertruck

Elsewhere, Tesla is likely to be in the spotlight after the EV manufacturer said on Sunday it had built its first Cybertruck, after two years of delays.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) stock rose premarket after Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said it has signed an agreement with Sony (NYSE: ) to keep the popular gaming franchise “Call of Duty” on PlayStation, potentially overcoming a key hurdle facing its $69 billion purchase of the video game manufacturer.

Crude hit by weak Chinese growth

Oil prices fell Monday after the disappointing Chinese growth numbers raised concerns about future demand from the world’s largest crude importer.

Additionally, two of the three Libyan oil fields that were shut down on Thursday, including the country’s second-largest, Sharara, resumed production over the weekend.

The news that Russia has withdrawn from the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal added extra volatility to the market, given the uncertainty surrounding the West’s response.

By 06:45 ET, the futures traded 1.4% lower at $74.25 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.4% to $78.73.

Both benchmarks recorded a third straight week of gains last week, climbing to their highest levels since April.

Additionally, fell 0.1% to $1,962.35/oz, while traded 0.1% higher at 1.1236.

2022-07-17, Investing.com,Evercore ISI cautious on Netflix stock into the Q2 EPS report,https://in.investing.com/news/evercore-isi-cautious-on-netflix-stock-into-the-q2-eps-report-432SI-3726010,"Evercore ISI analysts previewed Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) upcoming second-quarter earnings print.

They see the potential for a pullback in NFLX stock after the Q2 EPS report. Hence, they “would prefer to buy NFLX shares after the print rather than before.”

“Buyside expectations in terms of Net Sub Adds are almost certainly higher than Street, with the market likely looking for more like 4MM-5MM Subs in Q2 and a similar to higher level in Q3 (5-7MM). If the positive intra-quarter Sub trends reported by third-party tracking services are accurate, these expectations appear reasonable. But we would view them as likely limiting the opportunity for upside surprise and increasing the odds of a negative surprise,” the analysts explained in a client note.

They recently issued a “Tactical Underperform” call on Netflix stock and removed it from the list of Top Picks last month. Still, the analysts remain bullish long-term on NFLX stock.

""We are sticking with Outperform rating on NFLX as we believe this stock still has legs – we would point you to our 20 by 25 Bull Case for Netflix (analysis here), that is, $20 in ’25 EPS with a 25X P/E multiple to $500 in share price by ’24, driven by an incremental 20-30MM subs growth from ’23 to ’25 from SAVOD and Paid Sharing benefits. With 1) fundamentals improving, 2) moving past peak competition, 3) product initiatives (SAVOD & Paid Sharing) ramping up, and 4) profitability strengthening with FCF inflection, margin expansion, cash content cost reaching scale, and buybacks resuming, we believe there is still a lot to like about NFLX at this level for longterm investors.""

They expect that Netflix’s Q2 revenue increased by 3.9% year-over-year on the back of the 2.22 million increase in the net new subscribers. These estimates are “reasonable,” the analysts said.

Similarly, Street’s Q3 estimates are “bracketable.” Moreover, Evercore ISI’s survey results continue to be positive for Netflix.

Netflix shares are down 0.3% in pre-open Monday."

1. U.S. stock futures mixed

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Monday as investors looked ahead to a busy week of corporate results and digested underwhelming economic growth data out of China.

By 05:06 ET (09:06 GMT), the contract had lost 50 points or 0.14%, slipped slightly by 2 points or 0.03%, and edged up by 18 points or 0.11%.

All three of these indices ended Friday with weekly gains of over 2%, driven in part by softer-than-expected inflation data for June that boosted hopes that the may soon begin to step away from its recent policy tightening campaign. Traders also had a chance to parse through earnings from several major banks, including the biggest U.S. lender JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ).

Meanwhile, sentiment heading into U.S. dealmaking was dented by data out of China that showed that growth in the world's second-largest economy had slowed substantially in the second quarter (see below).

2. Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear

The earnings calendar on Monday will be relatively light compared to the parade of companies due to deliver their latest results this week.

Big financial industry players Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are all scheduled to unveil quarterly earnings in the coming days. Bank balance sheets have come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the failure of several regional rivals earlier this year, an event that plunged the financial services industry into crisis.

On Friday, lenders JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) posted surges in year-on-year net income, although peer Citigroup's (NYSE: ) profit tumbled by over a third. Collectively, net interest income, the difference between what a bank earns for loans and loses from deposits, at the three groups rose 30%, boosted by a spike in interest rates.

Elsewhere this week, Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ), streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ), and carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) are among the key businesses to report.

3. Chinese economic growth cools

The Chinese economy expanded at a much slower rate in the second quarter, casting further doubt over the country's nascent rebound from draconian pandemic-era restrictions.

China's second-quarter increased by 0.8% from the prior three-month period, slightly above expectations for an uptick of 0.5%, but cooling significantly from 2.2% in the first quarter.

On an annualized basis, expanded by 6.3% thanks largely to a lower basis for comparison from the corresponding COVID-hit quarter last year. But this reading missed estimates for growth of 7.3%.

Faltering property sector, sputtering , and weak have combined to weigh on an economic recovery in China that had seemed to be gathering momentum at the beginning of 2022.

4. Microsoft signs ""Call of Duty"" licensing agreement with Sony

Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) contentious push to acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) received a major boost over the weekend when the tech giant agreed to keep the mega-popular gaming franchise ""Call of Duty"" on Sony's (TYO: ) PlayStation console.

The deal helps overcome a key hurdle facing Microsoft's $69 billion purchase of Activision, which would be the biggest in the history of the video gaming industry. Shares in Activision surged by more than 4% in premarket trading on Monday.

Sony (NYSE: ) has previously stood in opposition to the tie-up, arguing that Microsoft will use it to in effect prevent access to lucrative titles like action shooter ""Call of Duty"" to PlayStation.

The announcement comes after U.S. antitrust regulators, who have voiced concerns over lessening competition, had multiple attempts to prevent the merger from closing rejected by a federal court in San Francisco last week.

The decision in turn led the U.K.'s competition watchdog, which had blocked the deal in April, to offer Microsoft and Activision a new chance to remedy their worries.

5. Oil volatile in the wake of Chinese data, Russian grain deal uncertainty

Oil prices moved lower in choppy trading on Monday, with traders gauging the health of demand in the top crude importer China and uncertainty around the West's response to Russia withdrawing from a U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal.

Meanwhile, two of the three Libyan oil fields that were shut down on Thursday resumed production over the weekend, adding supply to the global market.

By 05:31 ET, the futures traded 1.25% lower at $74.38 a barrel, while the contract shed 1.09% to $79.00 per barrel.

But the stock climbed more than 2% as chief executive David Solomon touted optimism about signs of life in the investment banking business amid a pick-up in deal activity.

“It definitely feels better over the course of the last six-to-eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year,” Solomon said in an earnings call following the bank's quarterly results.

Investment banking fees fell 20%. Shares ticked up 0.6%.

Regional lenders fared better, with (NYSE: ) and (NYSE: ) both beating expectations as they got a boost from rising interest rates.

Bank stocks have been beaten down this year after the failures of three large banks this spring stoked fears that rapidly rising rates would pose excess risks in the financial system. The S&P 500 banking index is down 3.4% this year.

Fed heads to meeting next week

The is poised to raise rates again at its meeting next week after pausing on another rate hike in June. Futures traders expect a quarter of a percentage point hike, but then some believe the Fed could stay on hold until it assesses the progress of its actions so far to cool inflation.

1. Goldman Sachs to round out bank earnings

Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is set to unveil its latest returns on Wednesday, with some investors bracing for the Wall Street powerhouse to potentially report one of its weakest quarters ever.

A slowdown in stock and bond trading, as well as an expected drop in lucrative investment banking fees, are projected to have weighed heavily on Goldman over the last three months.

Recent results from the banking giant's closest rivals point to the impact of the dearth in dealmaking. On Tuesday, Goldman peer Morgan Stanley's (NYSE: ) second quarter revenue from sales and trading slipped by more than a fifth.

But analysts worry that Goldman faces other issues; namely, an anticipated write-down worth several hundred million dollars from its purchase of home improvement lending group GreenSky, and losses on its consumer and real estate loan portfolios.

Chief executive David Solomon and other members of Goldman's management team have already flagged that this will be a challenging quarter. But just how bad it will be remains uncertain.

2. Tesla and Netflix ahead

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) are also among the biggest businesses on tap to report results Wednesday as the parade of second quarter earnings gathers speed.

For Tesla, the focus will likely center around the EV giant's gross margin, which analysts expect will slump to a ""trough"" following a series of price cuts aimed at boosting volumes and countering intensifying competition.

Tesla shares, however, have surged over the past three months thanks to solid delivery numbers and charging deals with legacy automakers like GM (NYSE: ) and Ford (NYSE: ). The stock has also been swept up in the enthusiasm around companies with exposure to artificial intelligence (AI).

Meanwhile, investors are curious to see how Netflix has fared after it launched a drive in May to crack down on password sharing between users. According to data from streaming analytics company Antenna cited by the Wall Street Journal, the number of new sign-ups in the U.S. between May 25 and 28 hit its highest level over a four-day period since Antenna first began compiling the figures. However, cancelations increased in June, per Antenna.

Observers are also keen to see if Netflix has any comments around the ongoing strike by Hollywood's writers and actors. Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos said in May that, even if these labor actions come to pass, Netflix can still rely on a ""robust"" slate of upcoming content.

Both Tesla and Netflix are scheduled to report after the close of U.S. trading.

3. Futures hover near flatline

U.S. stock futures ticked up on Wednesday, but stayed mostly around the flatline, as traders looked ahead to another busy earnings day.

At 05:04 ET (09:04 GMT), the contract added 54 points or 0.15%, rose by 2 point or 0.05%, and increased by 13 points or 0.08%.

The is coming off its seventh consecutive positive session, while the benchmark and the tech-heavy also rose. The main indices jumped to their best close since April 2022.

More than 80% of the 38 companies in the S&P 500 that have posted results have delivered earnings beats, CNBC reported, citing FactSet data. Coupled with last week's slower-than-anticipated data, the solid earnings could help bolster the case that the U.S. economy may be able to avoid a sharp downturn despite an unprecedented series of interest rate hikes by the .

4. Microsoft closes at record high

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) shares notched their highest close on record Tuesday after the software behemoth announced the pricing of its suite of AI tools.

The Redmond, Washington-based tech group said it would charge $30 per month for access to its generative AI features in its uber-popular productivity services like Microsoft 365.

Analysts projected that the move, which would slap a large premium on top of the average monthly cost paid by Microsoft 365 customers, could lead to a significant boost in revenues. In a note, Wedbush analysts said they were “very bullish for the total addressable cloud AI market opportunity for Microsoft that could increase cloud revenue annually by 20% by 2025[.]""

Chief executive Satya Nadella defended the hefty price tag, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that the new AI features are ""the same class of value"" as its other ubiquitous applications like Word, Excel, and Teams.

5. Oil inches up amid supply constraints, demand worries

Crude prices edged higher Wednesday with traders eyeing supply strains, concerns over U.S. demand, and promises by China's government to take measures to reinvigorate the country's sputtering post-pandemic recovery.

The Federal Reserve is widely projected to increase borrowing costs by a further 25 basis points this month, according to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool . The decision could weigh on demand in the U.S., the world's largest oil consumer.

The analysts, who have an Overweight rating and a $500 price target on the stock, stated in their second-quarter preview that they believe investors would buy a pullback on the long-term outlook for Netflix in the event of short-term pressure on the print.

Wells Fargo also raised some estimates for the stock.

""We found that the highest correlation was between Apptopia MAUs as a predictor of NFLX's EOP total subs. However, based on historical trends, the 3P MAU data tends to exceed the NFLX reported number by 100bps. When we adjust for this, we come up with 2Q net adds of 2.1mm, which is above Street's 1.8mm,"" wrote analysts.

""While we're raising our Q2 net adds from 1.5mm to 2.1mm to stick to our correlation, we think buyside is looking for closer to 4mm+, and rev growth of 5%+ y/y (vs. us at 4%),"" they added.

Wells Fargo also believes FX is turning into a tailwind for the company due to a weakening dollar.

""In Q2, FX turned into a tailwind for NFLX's print, mainly driven by a weakening dollar against the euro and BP. In addition, LatAm and APAC went from y/y MSD headwinds to around neutral. We estimate NFLX's y/y FX tailwind is now ~2% vs. constant currency, or roughly $180mm in positive translation. As a result, we are raising our 2Q rev estimate by ~$40mm to $8.3bn to account for the greater-than-expected benefit,"" the analysts explained."

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks

JPMorgan analysts: “Since the relative high in May to early last week, Eurozone has lost 12% vs the US, in USD terms, and is trying to bounce. We believe there is another leg of underperformance ahead, and reiterate our moving the region to UW two months ago. This was partly given our view that Eurozone activity momentum was about to roll over.”

Roth MKM analysts: “We are starting to see minor negative divergences build on the top-down view of the S&P 500 but not enough to cause concern. There has been a swift improvement in sentiment as a chase mentality builds. Breadth was improved. The breakdown of the US dollar should provide tailwinds for stocks and commodities. The Materials sector should play catch up to the breakout in Industrials.”

Fairlead analysts: “The major indices pushed higher ahead of earnings season, allowing the SPX to reach the measured move projection of ~4510 last week from May’s breakout. Momentum gauges still point higher, suggesting the SPX may make progress toward minor resistance from early 2022 near 4600. However, we would be wary of any downturns noting signs of upside exhaustion have arisen for the SPX and NDX.”

BTIG analysts: “The major indices have gotten off to a strong start over the first half of July. Towards the end of last week, however, we started to see some signs of exhaustion and upside capitulation… With many names having rallied significantly over the last three months, we wouldn’t be surprised to see more of this over the coming weeks, which would be indicative of buyer exhaustion.”

Sevens Report analysts: “At current levels, the S&P 500 has priced in 1) No hard landing, 2) Falling inflation and 3) A Fed that won’t be raising rates much longer (and possibly cutting soon after). That’s basically the best outcome anyone could have hoped for at the start of the year, and that means the gains in stocks are legitimate, but also likely exhausted in the near term and it’ll take something else to push stocks materially higher from here.”"

By 06:45 ET (10:45 GMT), the contract was down 80 points, or 0.2%, traded 6 points, or 0.1% lower, and dropped 7 points, or 0.1%.

The benchmark indices on Wall Street recorded a winning week last week, helped by softer-than-expected inflation data which advanced the theory that the Federal Reserve’s rate-hiking cycle will reach its peak after a last increase next week.

The blue-chip gained 2.3%, its best weekly gain since March, while the broad-based rose 2.4%, and the tech-heavy jumped 3.3%.

NY Empire State manufacturing index due

The data slate is largely empty Monday, with only the scheduled for release. But the week includes such numbers as U.S. , and reports on , , and .

However, these numbers are unlikely to change the narrative that a 25-basis-point hike from the later this month is likely to be the last one in this cycle.

Data from China, released earlier Monday, showed that growth in the second-largest economy in the world was slowing sharply, casting further doubt over the country's nascent rebound from its COVID hit.

China's second-quarter increased by 0.8% from the prior three-month period, a significant cooling from 2.2% growth in the first quarter.

More banks, Tesla and Netflix set to report this week

Positive quarterly results from banking giants JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) add to last week’s positive sentiment, although peer Citigroup's (NYSE: ) profit tumbled by over a third.

More lenders are due to reveal their earnings this week, including Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).

These numbers are likely to come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the failure of several regional rivals earlier this year, an event that plunged the financial services industry into crisis.

Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ), streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) are also among the key businesses scheduled to report this week.

Tesla completes Cybertruck

Elsewhere, Tesla is likely to be in the spotlight after the EV manufacturer said on Sunday it had built its first Cybertruck, after two years of delays.

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) stock rose premarket after Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) said it has signed an agreement with Sony (NYSE: ) to keep the popular gaming franchise “Call of Duty” on PlayStation, potentially overcoming a key hurdle facing its $69 billion purchase of the video game manufacturer.

Crude hit by weak Chinese growth

Oil prices fell Monday after the disappointing Chinese growth numbers raised concerns about future demand from the world’s largest crude importer.

Additionally, two of the three Libyan oil fields that were shut down on Thursday, including the country’s second-largest, Sharara, resumed production over the weekend.

The news that Russia has withdrawn from the U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal added extra volatility to the market, given the uncertainty surrounding the West’s response.

By 06:45 ET, the futures traded 1.4% lower at $74.25 a barrel, while the contract dropped 1.4% to $78.73.

Both benchmarks recorded a third straight week of gains last week, climbing to their highest levels since April.

Additionally, fell 0.1% to $1,962.35/oz, while traded 0.1% higher at 1.1236.

2022-07-17, Investing.com,Evercore ISI cautious on Netflix stock into the Q2 EPS report,https://in.investing.com/news/evercore-isi-cautious-on-netflix-stock-into-the-q2-eps-report-432SI-3726010,"Evercore ISI analysts previewed Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) upcoming second-quarter earnings print.

They see the potential for a pullback in NFLX stock after the Q2 EPS report. Hence, they “would prefer to buy NFLX shares after the print rather than before.”

“Buyside expectations in terms of Net Sub Adds are almost certainly higher than Street, with the market likely looking for more like 4MM-5MM Subs in Q2 and a similar to higher level in Q3 (5-7MM). If the positive intra-quarter Sub trends reported by third-party tracking services are accurate, these expectations appear reasonable. But we would view them as likely limiting the opportunity for upside surprise and increasing the odds of a negative surprise,” the analysts explained in a client note.

They recently issued a “Tactical Underperform” call on Netflix stock and removed it from the list of Top Picks last month. Still, the analysts remain bullish long-term on NFLX stock.

""We are sticking with Outperform rating on NFLX as we believe this stock still has legs – we would point you to our 20 by 25 Bull Case for Netflix (analysis here), that is, $20 in ’25 EPS with a 25X P/E multiple to $500 in share price by ’24, driven by an incremental 20-30MM subs growth from ’23 to ’25 from SAVOD and Paid Sharing benefits. With 1) fundamentals improving, 2) moving past peak competition, 3) product initiatives (SAVOD & Paid Sharing) ramping up, and 4) profitability strengthening with FCF inflection, margin expansion, cash content cost reaching scale, and buybacks resuming, we believe there is still a lot to like about NFLX at this level for longterm investors.""

They expect that Netflix’s Q2 revenue increased by 3.9% year-over-year on the back of the 2.22 million increase in the net new subscribers. These estimates are “reasonable,” the analysts said.

Similarly, Street’s Q3 estimates are “bracketable.” Moreover, Evercore ISI’s survey results continue to be positive for Netflix.

2022-07-17, Investing.com,"U.S. corporate earnings ahead, Chinese GDP underwhelms - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/us-corporate-earnings-ahead-chinese-gdp-underwhelms--whats-moving-markets-3725853,"Investing.com -- Investors prepare for a raft of fresh corporate earnings this week that will include some of the largest U.S. banks and major tech industry players. Elsewhere, Chinese quarterly growth figures provide further evidence of the country's sputtering recovery from the pandemic. Plus, Microsoft signs a licensing agreement with PlayStation over the ""Call of Duty"" gaming franchise that could bring the tech giant's mega-merger with Activision Blizzard one step closer to completion.

1. U.S. stock futures mixed

U.S. stock futures were mixed on Monday as investors looked ahead to a busy week of corporate results and digested underwhelming economic growth data out of China.

By 05:06 ET (09:06 GMT), the contract had lost 50 points or 0.14%, slipped slightly by 2 points or 0.03%, and edged up by 18 points or 0.11%.

All three of these indices ended Friday with weekly gains of over 2%, driven in part by softer-than-expected inflation data for June that boosted hopes that the may soon begin to step away from its recent policy tightening campaign. Traders also had a chance to parse through earnings from several major banks, including the biggest U.S. lender JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ).

Meanwhile, sentiment heading into U.S. dealmaking was dented by data out of China that showed that growth in the world's second-largest economy had slowed substantially in the second quarter (see below).

2. Second-quarter earnings season kicks into gear

The earnings calendar on Monday will be relatively light compared to the parade of companies due to deliver their latest results this week.

Big financial industry players Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are all scheduled to unveil quarterly earnings in the coming days. Bank balance sheets have come under heavy scrutiny in the wake of the failure of several regional rivals earlier this year, an event that plunged the financial services industry into crisis.

On Friday, lenders JPMorgan and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) posted surges in year-on-year net income, although peer Citigroup's (NYSE: ) profit tumbled by over a third. Collectively, net interest income, the difference between what a bank earns for loans and loses from deposits, at the three groups rose 30%, boosted by a spike in interest rates.

Elsewhere this week, Elon Musk-led electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ: ), streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ), and carrier United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) are among the key businesses to report.

3. Chinese economic growth cools

The Chinese economy expanded at a much slower rate in the second quarter, casting further doubt over the country's nascent rebound from draconian pandemic-era restrictions.

China's second-quarter increased by 0.8% from the prior three-month period, slightly above expectations for an uptick of 0.5%, but cooling significantly from 2.2% in the first quarter.

On an annualized basis, expanded by 6.3% thanks largely to a lower basis for comparison from the corresponding COVID-hit quarter last year. But this reading missed estimates for growth of 7.3%.

Faltering property sector, sputtering , and weak have combined to weigh on an economic recovery in China that had seemed to be gathering momentum at the beginning of 2022.

4. Microsoft signs ""Call of Duty"" licensing agreement with Sony

Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) contentious push to acquire Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) received a major boost over the weekend when the tech giant agreed to keep the mega-popular gaming franchise ""Call of Duty"" on Sony's (TYO: ) PlayStation console.

The deal helps overcome a key hurdle facing Microsoft's $69 billion purchase of Activision, which would be the biggest in the history of the video gaming industry. Shares in Activision surged by more than 4% in premarket trading on Monday.

Sony (NYSE: ) has previously stood in opposition to the tie-up, arguing that Microsoft will use it to in effect prevent access to lucrative titles like action shooter ""Call of Duty"" to PlayStation.

The announcement comes after U.S. antitrust regulators, who have voiced concerns over lessening competition, had multiple attempts to prevent the merger from closing rejected by a federal court in San Francisco last week.

The decision in turn led the U.K.'s competition watchdog, which had blocked the deal in April, to offer Microsoft and Activision a new chance to remedy their worries.

5. Oil volatile in the wake of Chinese data, Russian grain deal uncertainty

Oil prices moved lower in choppy trading on Monday, with traders gauging the health of demand in the top crude importer China and uncertainty around the West's response to Russia withdrawing from a U.N.-brokered Black Sea grain deal.

Meanwhile, two of the three Libyan oil fields that were shut down on Thursday resumed production over the weekend, adding supply to the global market.

By 05:31 ET, the futures traded 1.25% lower at $74.38 a barrel, while the contract shed 1.09% to $79.00 per barrel.

Both benchmarks recorded a third straight week of gains last week, touching their highest levels since April. Some support came from slower-than-expected U.S. inflation data as well as anticipated output cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia later this summer."

Meanwhile, oil prices look poised for another weekly gain.

1. Earnings time

Second-quarter earnings season gets underway in earnest in the coming week, with Tesla (NASDAQ: ) the first of the massive growth and technology names that have dominated the U.S. stock market so far this year to report, with expected on Wednesday.

Tesla is one of seven huge stocks, along with Apple (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) recently dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by investors. Shares in the megacaps have soared between 40% and over 200% so far this year, accounting for almost all of the ’s rally.

There are indications the rally is broadening to other sectors, but the outsize gains have come with big earnings expectations so if Tesla or any other megacaps disappoint this quarter, the hit to equity indexes could be severe.

A slew of other big companies also post results in the coming week. Bank earnings continue, with Bank of America (NYSE: ) on Tuesday and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) on Wednesday. Also on the docket are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Philip Morris (NYSE: ).

2. U.S. economic data

U.S. retail sales data for June on Tuesday is expected to show an increase of , boosted by rebounding auto sales and higher gasoline station sales, indicating that consumer demand remains resilient.

Investors will also get an update on the health of the housing sector with reports on , and . High mortgage rates are still weighing on sales of existing homes, but construction is improving given stable pricing and a pick-up in new home sales due to the lack of properties on the market.

There will also be reports on activity, which is expected to remain sluggish along with the weekly data on .

3. China economic data

A flurry of economic data from China on Monday is expected to show its post-pandemic bounce is rapidly losing momentum, fueling expectations that Beijing will soon need to unveil more stimulus measures.

Gross domestic product is expected to have grown by an annualized in the three months to June, compared with growth of 4.5% in the first quarter.

However, that reading will be heavily skewed by a sharp slump in activity in the spring, when large parts of the country were still locked down.

Mounting deflationary pressure and a slump in trade have added to concerns over the outlook for the world’s second-largest economy, which as recently as six months ago had investors betting on a robust recovery.

4. U.K. inflation

The U.K. is to release June inflation data on Wednesday and investors will be watching closely as it will likely determine the size of the Bank of England’s next rate hike.

The headline consumer price index is expected to ease to year-over-year from 8.7% in May as food and fuel prices dip. is also expected to edge lower, but the services component is expected to hold steady at a post-COVID high of 7.4%.

In its June meeting minutes the BoE said further tightening would be required if there were signs of persistent inflationary pressures in the economy, including in services CPI.

This could make August’s meeting a close call: an uptick in services CPI would probably lock in bets for another 50-basis point hike, while a lower reading would probably nudge the dial in favor of a smaller 25 bps increase.

5. Oil prices

Oil prices recorded their third-straight weekly gain last week and the rally could resume in the coming week as easing inflation, plans to refill the U.S. strategic reserve, supply cuts and disruptions underpin prices.

""While oil prices are likely slightly overbought in the very near term, touching the highest levels since early May, the bias appears to be for a grind higher,"" Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management told Reuters.

Oil prices gained nearly 2% last week, after supply disruptions in Libya and Nigeria heightened concerns that the markets will tighten in coming months.

Oil prices fell more than a dollar a barrel on Friday as the dollar strengthened and oil traders booked profits from a strong rally.

The streaming platform first announced the profile transfer feature in October last year to prevent password sharing.

The feature allows users to transfer their personalised recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games and other preferences to another account.

Meanwhile, last month, the company had removed the $9.99 CAD per month Basic plan in Canada for new subscribers.

To get rid of ads and enable downloads, users now must pay $16.99 CAD per month for the Standard plan.

2022-07-11, Investing.com,This internet stock is a new Top Pick at Evercore ISI with upside potential of 75%,https://in.investing.com/news/this-internet-stock-is-a-new-top-pick-at-evercore-isi-with-upside-potential-of-75-432SI-3719259,"Evercore ISI analysts reflected on the Internet sector with a positive view ahead of the Q2 earnings season. The analysts are “tactically constructive” on the large caps despite the broker’s coverage of 19 stocks being up 44% year-to-date.

“Given the rally in the Net stocks, we’re tempted to downgrade our investment opinion. But we won’t for two reasons – Multiples are still depressed – i.e. below average – and Fundamentals are still soft – i.e. revenue growth rates are weak,” analysts wrote in a client note.

On the valuation front, they highlighted Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Etsy (NASDAQ: ), and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) as stocks that are trading “well below their pre-Covid Median.”

Analysts picked Uber (NYSE: ) as the new No.1 long in their coverage of internet stocks. Uber replaces Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) stock, which is up 141% YTD and which moves down to the 3rd spot while Amazon remains 2nd on the list of best internet stocks to own.

“UBER has one of the strongest top-line growth outlooks among the companies we cover and faces a series of potential “value catalysts” – the attainment of GAAP profitability in H2, the initiation of capital returns, possibly also in H2, and S&P 500 inclusion,” analysts said.

“Further, we believe its Mobility segment is likely to be relatively recession-resistant from a demand perspective (we still gotta commute) and may actually have a recession hedge from a supply perspective (driving is a quick side-hustle for many). Our recent survey work suggests that demand for Delivery may actually be as “utilitarian” as the demand for Mobility, which implies a most robust outlook than the market may appreciate.”

Hence, the analysts concluded by saying that Uber stock looks well-positioned to re-rate as more and more investors are convinced of Uber’s ability to deliver over $4 billion in free cash flow in 2024.

Evercore ISI’s price target of $75 per share on Uber stock implies an upside potential of over 75%."

In a 'Supplemental Privacy Policy,' Meta said that ""You may deactivate your Threads profile at any time, but your Threads profile can only be deleted by deleting your Instagram account.""

According to the social network, a Threads profile is an integral part of the user’s Instagram account. Instagram currently has more than 2 billion users globally and Threads, touted as a 'Twitter killer' is available in 100 countries, including in India, is billed as the next Twitter killer.

""Threads app stands out from other Twitter challengers by tapping into a ready user base potentially migrating from Instagram on Day Zero. With Mark Zuckerberg's proven execution skills, Threads has the potential to become a breakthrough alternative to Twitter,"" Prabhu Ram, head of Industry Intelligence Group (IIG) at CyberMedia Research (CMR), told IANS.

Even if they capture just a fraction of the Instagram user base, as little as a quarter, Threads could rival Twitter in audience size.

""While focusing on user growth initially, Threads is poised to attract advertisers as its user base expands,” said Ram. Some top brands like Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), NFL and Pepsi have expressed their vote of confidence in Threads by signing up to the app, according to reports.

Similar to Instagram, with Threads, users can follow and connect with friends and creators who share their interests, including the people they follow on Instagram.

Moreover, users under 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private profile when they join the app. Users can also control who can mention them or reply to them within Threads. Like on Instagram, users can add hidden words to filter out replies to their threads that contain specific words. They can also unfollow, block, restrict or report a profile on Threads by tapping the three-dot menu, and any accounts they have blocked on Instagram will automatically be blocked on Threads.

BofA analysts told investors that Netflix, which is rated at Buy with a $490 price target, is ""poised to outperform.""

They listed four main drivers, including a crackdown on password sharing, the introduction of a value-oriented, ad-supported tier that expands its total addressable market and monetization, an inflection point in free cash flow, and a significant subscriber runway due to the ongoing shift from linear to streaming.

""Netflix's introduction of an ad-supported tier provides significant potential operating and financial upside,"" they wrote.

On Disney — which the firm has assigned a Buy rating and $135 price target — the analysts said it had underperformed the S&P by over 40% since November 2021, but they believe it is set to outperform in Q3.

According to the analysts, the potential rise is due to recent price increases across Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+, strong advertiser demand for the recently launched ad-supported tier on Disney+, cost discipline across the DTC business, and the continued robust theme park demand with several levers for future growth."

“We continue to believe the Paid Sharing may add very little incremental revenue. Based on the more bullish Ad Tier estimates, we are raising our target price,” the analysts said in a client note.

“We have refined our analysis now that we have actual Paid Sharing prices in many markets (versus just the LATAM test in 3Q22). Our updated analysis still suggests muted upside from Paid Sharing.

2022-06-28, Investing.com,Netflix target lifted at Oppenheimer on password-sharing ban and possible higher-priced basic tier,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-target-lifted-at-oppenheimer-on-passwordsharing-ban-and-possible-higherpriced-basic-tier-432SI-3703177,"Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ: ) are indicated to open 1% higher on Wall Street on Wednesday after Oppenheimer analysts raised their price target to $500 from $450. They are among the most recent analysts to lift numbers as the streaming giant's password-sharing ban lifts subscriber counts and as they see the potential that the company's possible discontinuation of its lowest-priced ad-free plan lifts revenue per subscriber.

The analysts said they are raising the price target in anticipation of a rise in subscribers due to bullish indicators for Paid Sharing. Furthermore, they anticipate higher revenue per subscriber with the potential discontinuation of the lowest-priced ad-free plan, which is currently being tested in Canada. Shifting away from the lowest-priced ad-free tier is the obvious next step, unlocking approximately $15.50 in revenue per subscriber (advertising + subscription) compared to $9.99 for the ad-free option. This transition to a $6.99 ad plan could result in approximately $4.4 billion in annual revenue, accounting for approximately 13% of the projected '23E revenue. Additionally, they believe that an extended writers' strike and recent media layoffs could serve as other potential near-term tailwinds.

Lastly, Netflix's share of US TV viewership has increased to 2.6% quarter-to-date (QTD), up from 2.3% last year and 2.5% in 1Q23. While they expect a gradual geographic rollout throughout the next year, they believe that investors can already begin factoring in the additional revenue today."

If you are currently on the Basic plan, you can remain on this plan until you change plans or cancel your account,"" the company said on its support page.

According to TechCrunch, the company's plans continue to start at $5.99 CAD per month, with the recently introduced ad-supported plan offering most of the Netflix catalogue with 1080p HD streaming support.

To get rid of ads and enable downloads, users now must pay $16.99 CAD per month for the Standard plan.

The Basic plan included ad-free streaming but was limited to 720p and one concurrent stream. Those who are currently paying for the Basic plan will be able to keep it until they cancel their account.

Netflix initially rolled out the 'Basic With Ads' steaming plan on November 3 last year to subscribers in the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.

Meanwhile, Netflix has rolled out its ad-supported plan 'Basic with Ads' for Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV users after a delay of months.

“YouTube is internally testing a product for playing online games, according to an email sent to employees at parent company Google (NASDAQ: ),” the report said. It signals Google’s ambitions to move beyond video hosting into games that can easily be played and shared between users, it added.

YouTube, which has billions of monthly users, is already a popular destination for gamers. The new gaming offering would feature arcade-style games like Stack Bounce, where players use a bouncing ball to smash through layers of bricks.

A company spokesperson said that gaming has long been a focus at YouTube. “We’re always experimenting with new features but have nothing to announce right now,” the spokesperson added.

The gaming experiment on YouTube comes as Google shut down its Cloud gaming service called Stadia early this year, after it failed to gain traction with users.

The analysts told investors that while Netflix is structurally the best positioned to benefit from the engagement shift toward streaming, its ""present valuation seems to more than adequately reflect potential upside from near-term growth optimization tools like paid sharing and advertising.""

""Over the past month, Netflix equity is up ~28% (vs SPX up ~6%). This has been driven by subscriber growth concerns fading as churn post the rollout of paid sharing/password sharing shutdowns appears to have been surprisingly low, especially in the US, based on recent third-party data as well as our proprietary Barclays card data,"" wrote analysts.

Analysts noted that Netflix trends in May and early June in the U.S. appear to have improved despite the rollout of paid sharing. They added that they actually ""appear to be trending better after the rollout, despite the significant associated price increase.""

Order’s up! Netflix is cooking up something special for fans of our favorite food shows with the opening of our first culinary space, NETFLIX BITES, an elevated dining experience from several of our most well-known chefs.

Opening on June 30 in Los Angeles, NETFLIX BITES will spotlight acclaimed chefs from popular Netflix series such as chef Curtis Stone (Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend), who will collaborate with other beloved Netflix chefs including Dominique Crenn (Chef’s Table, Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend), Rodney Scott (Chef’s Table: BBQ), Ming Tsai (Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend), Ann Kim (Chef's Table: Pizza), Nadiya Hussain (Nadiya Bakes), Jacques Torres (Nailed It!) and Andrew Zimmern (Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend).

2022-06-13, Investing.com,Guggenheim sticks with Netflix as company continues to outperform,https://in.investing.com/news/guggenheim-sticks-with-netflix-as-company-continues-to-outperform-432SI-3683236,"Guggenheim reiterated a Buy rating on Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and raised their 12-month price target on the stock to $500.00 (From $375.00) as the company continues to outperform.

Analysts wrote in a note, “We continue to see under-appreciated opportunity in Netflix shares over the next 12 months even after year-to-date outperformance (up 44% vs. 35% for the NASDAQ 100). We believe that the company’s position as the global leader in high-quality, long-form streaming video will drive further financial upside through higher subscription ARPU, advertising revenue, and margin expansion.”

The company rolled out its paid sharing initiative in the U.S. and select markets worldwide in late May. Analysts believe that 24M of the estimated 100M households engaged in password sharing worldwide will be converted to paying customers over the next 12 months.

Supporting Guggenheim's theory in that conversion, data from third-party data provider Apptopia indicates that U.S. download trends have increased 10% over the first 14 days following the launch of consumer-facing announcements of the password sharing limitation when compared to the 14 days immediately prior.

Netflix highlighted the success of its 1Q paid sharing launches in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal, which took place on February 8. Despite an initial wave of cancellations, similar to what was observed in tests conducted in Latin America, management highlighted a subsequent surge in user acquisition and revenue as borrowers began activating their own accounts.

The company specifically pointed out the strong performance in Canada, considering it a reliable indicator for the United States. Furthermore, Netflix mentioned that the paid membership base in the U.S. had surpassed its pre-launch numbers for paid sharing, with revenue growth gaining momentum.

Analysts forecast that the addition of sub-accounts for paid sharing will contribute approximately $70 million in 2Q23 revenue, growing to ~$360M of revenue by 2Q24. This represents a ~4% contribution to Guggenheim’s total company revenue estimate in that period.

Shares of NFLX are up 1.65% in early trading on Tuesday."

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the biggest headlines out of a big earnings week for tech: reactions to Apple's Vision Pro launch; the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase; GM's collaboration with Tesla; Amazon Prime's coming ad-supported tier; and Netflix's win on password-sharing crackdown.

InvestingPro subscribers get tech headlines like these in real time. Never miss another market-moving alert.

A lackluster response to Apple's Vision Pro

Wall Street reacted with caution to Apple's (NASDAQ: ) launch of its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, which comes at a higher-than-expected price of $3,499.

CFRA, for example, said

Although we are impressed by its best-in-class hardware/immersive capabilities, we think AAPL failed to identify why it's a must-own device for consumers, at least for now. Still, the company's entry into the space and greater engagement from developers will help support adoption and new use cases over time.

Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.

And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""

Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.

Coinbase sued by SEC

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.

“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.

The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.

Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year.









General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging network

General Motors (NYSE: ) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ: ), into its EVs beginning in 2025.

The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE: ) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.

These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.

The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.

After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""

GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.

Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: report

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.

Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.

Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.

""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" it wrote in a client note.

The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.

Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.

Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdown

Netflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.

Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.

The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.

The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.

Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.

Senad Karaahmetovic, Sam Boughedda, Ambar Warrick, and Michael Elkins contributed to this report.

Goldman Sachs said it is encouraged by long-term growth prospects, ""but expect near-term financial contributions to be limited"" particularly given the high retail price point and media reports that it may be sold at breakeven.

And BofA similarly said it expects that ""adoption will take time.""

Apple shares initially sank on news of the launch but partially recovered, and ended the week down just 0.9%. The stock is up some 45% year to date.

Coinbase sued by SEC

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (NASDAQ: ) took a dive early in the week after it was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an alleged breach of U.S. securities rules.

“We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a press release.

The exchange is accused of making billions of dollars “unlawfully facilitating the buying and selling of crypto asset securities.”

BofA reiterated its Underperform rating on the stock and said, ""[W]e think these latest developments illustrate ongoing regulatory headwinds, which not only could threaten part of [Coinbase]’s business model, but also represent a big management distraction.""

Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest increased its stake in the company, as the stock hit near five-month lows. Wood has repeatedly expressed confidence in Coinbase and the broader crypto industry, and has cited a $1 million long-term price target for on the belief that it is an effective inflation hedge.

Coinbase shares fell nearly 16% for the week, having lost ground Monday as well after the SEC sued Binance. It's still up nearly 60% for the year.









General Motors to partake in Tesla's charging network

General Motors (NYSE: ) CEO Mary Barra confirmed this week that the company is preparing to integrate the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, designed by Tesla (NASDAQ: ), into its EVs beginning in 2025.

The announcement, made during a live meeting on Twitter Space with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, mirrors a similar revolution made late last month when neighboring rival Ford Motor (NYSE: ) also announced a collaboration with Musk's Tesla.

These partnerships allow Ford and GM customers to access the extensive network of Tesla Superchargers.

The next day, White House officials handed Tesla another win when they announced that the company’s Superchargers would be eligible to receive a portion of federal funds, amounting in the billions, so long as the chargers also included CCS connections.

After the GM news, Wedbush raised its price target on Tesla to $300 from $215, reiterated its ""Outperform"" rating, and added the shares to the ""Wedbush Best Ideas List.""

GM climbed more than 5% for the week to $36.23. Tesla was up 4% to $244.40, extending an over 117% gain year to date.

Amazon to launch ad-supported Prime Video tier: report

Amazon (NASDAQ: ) plans to launch an advertising-supported tier of its Prime Video streaming services as part of a move to bolster growth from entertainment, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday, citing unnamed sources.

Plans to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service follow similar moves by rivals including Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ) as streaming platforms look for ways to support content spending amid an ongoing battle for dominance.

Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ), meanwhile, are reportedly in talks with Amazon to add the ad-based tiers of their streaming services through Amazon’s Prime Video channels.

Bank of America analysts believe the ad-supported tier makes sense for Prime Video.

""Amazon’s user data, existing relationships with retail advertisers, and extensive ad sales teams provide a competitive advantage for monetizing ad-streaming. Also, tiering may enable Amazon to raise fees on ad-free Prime tiers, which would follow recent fee increases for various Prime and 3P services,"" it wrote in a client note.

The analysts also expect Amazon to continue to lean into video content vs. pulling back in a bid to drive usage.

Warner Discovery and Paramount closed the week up 18% and 5%, respectively, following the news. Amazon ended nearly breakeven for the week.

Netflix scoops up new subscribers amid password-sharing crackdown

Netflix climbed after The Wall Street Journal reported that the crackdown on password sharing in the U.S. delivered a new subscriber windfall in its earliest days.

Citing data from Antenna, the WSJ said the streaming giant gained more new U.S. subscriptions between May 25 and May 28, not long after it notified users in the U.S. and other countries of the limits than in any other four-day period since Antenna commenced compiling the data in 2019.

The jump in subscribers suggests Netflix’s decision to end password sharing is yielding results.

The move to end password sharing means users who share an account outside the same home must pay an extra $7.99 a month to watch. In addition, the number of extra members customers could add to their account is limited, depending on the tier they pay for.

Shares rose just under 5% for the week, with year-to-date gains totaling over 40%.

Amazon started with Overweight rating at Wells Fargo , upgraded by Edgewater

Wells Fargo initiated coverage on Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) with an Overweight rating and a price target of $159.00. Meanwhile, Edgewater Research upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform, as InvestingPro reported in real time.

Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon is planning to launch an ad-supported tier for its Prime Video streaming service. This follows similar moves by competitors like Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ), who are also exploring ad-supported options to support content spending. Additionally, Amazon is reportedly in talks with Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ: ) and Paramount (NASDAQ: ) to add ad-based tiers to their streaming services through Prime Video channels. Amazon, Paramount, and Warner have declined to comment on the matter, the WSJ said.

Aptive upgraded to Outperform

Wolfe Research upgraded Aptiv (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Peerperform with a price target of $130.00.

The firm sees several upcoming catalysts for Aptive, including a strong upward trajectory for margins, and significant potential for upside to consensus estimates. 2022 Street consensus of $4.38 EPS is consistent with the company's $4.00-$4.50 guidance, but Wolfe expects guidance to be raised on Q2/23 earnings call in August.

2 more upgrades

Evercore ISI upgraded Marsh & McLennan (NYSE: ) to Outperform from In Line and raised its price target to $199.00 from $195.00, expecting a 4-5% upside to consensus EPS with more visibility given a greater ability to leverage Centers of Excellence.

Piper Sandler upgraded Glaukos (NYSE: ) to Overweight from Neutral and raised its price target to $80.00 from $55.00, noting it believes the Street is underestimating the ramp of both iStent Infinite and, more critically, iDose.

2022-06-07, Investing.com,Netflix adds 3% as Wells Fargo sets a Street-high target with 25% upside,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-adds-3-as-wells-fargo-sets-a-streethigh-target-with-25-upside-432SI-3675787,"Netflix (NASDAQ: ) shares rose nearly 3% on Wednesday after Wall Street analysts weighed in positively on the company’s outlook.

Wells Fargo analysts assigned a new Street-high price target of $500 per share as deep-dive analysis into NFLX's opportunity pointed towards the additional upside.

“While our deep dive is a somewhat cautionary tale (and we reduce out year US ad ARPU) we still think NFLX is improving its customer lifetime value. It has proven that ARPU maximization and is not the same as revenue maximization, and ad scale should lead to owner economics and higher revs/margins/FCF,” they said in a client note.

“While a recent rally could mean less near-term upside, we remain long-term NFLX bulls,” the analysts added.

Similarly, JPMorgan analysts introduced the December 2024 target of $470 per share, which compares to the prior December 2022 target of $380.

“We came out of NFLX’s Upfront presentation 3 weeks ago incrementally positive – not so much on advertising, but because the broader paid sharing rollout was imminent & because we had increased confidence NFLX could roll out additional markets with less friction than the company experienced in Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, & Spain in February. We believe that is playing out as NFLX has improved communications w/sharers & borrowers (as well as non-sharing members) & eased concerns related to access while traveling,” they wrote.

The change follows news last week that Netflix would start its U.S. effort to reshape password sharing. Analysts are positive about these changes and are also less worried about competition.

Equity analysts explained the bank's increased confidence, saying, “The new rules and pricing was right in-line with our model ($7.99 for paid sharing plan). We are now more confident in our thesis: the meaningful % of borrowers will shift into new plans following the updated pricing, and we worry less about competition (competitors are in the midst of removing content, lowering budgets, and raising prices).”

Overall, Jefferies continues to believe subscriber growth will be driven by password sharing changes.

“These changes will push non-payers into a new subscription tier vs. churning out or up-pricing. With about 100M ‘borrowers’ potentially becoming subscribers, we expect the most popular tier to vary by country. Our model is predicated on ~35% converting to subs over the next 24 months. Another benefit of the ad tier is we believe the turn-off-turn-on-ers (consumers focused on value) will become regular subscribers via the ad tier.”

While Jefferies remains positive on Netflix shares, analysts expect a lot of noise about the password sharing changes, and they are cautious on how the stock could perform during the next 30 to 45 days.

“In the past, when services raise prices, there is typically a 30-45 day temporary increase in churn. We would expect the same as subscribers and password sharers get the news of the upcoming changes. Because the June quarterly earnings falls in the window, mgmt may take a conservative view on guidance. We would be paying attention to churn rates in late July,” analysts said."

The announcement was part of a larger presentation by management, which left analysts more positive on the company. Oppenheimer applauded the ""ad tier progress,"" and Evercore reiterated its Outperform rating as new updates show the ad-supported tier is “steadily gaining traction.”

Tesla's Elon Musk to consider advertising

During Tesla's (NASDAQ: ) annual shareholder meeting, Musk appeared to decide in real-time to try advertising its vehicles after years of resisting the idea. An investor at the meeting asked about a potential advertising campaign to teach more about the full TSLA story, to which Musk responded that Tesla will try out “a little bit of advertising.""

In response to this, Wedbush said:

We view this as a major positive for Tesla as many parts of the Tesla product portfolio are undervalued by the Street... many in the general public [do] not know about the affordability and capabilities of TSLA products. ...We were very pleased to see the change in stance around advertising with Musk and overall.

Tesla shares gained 7.5% for the week to $180.14.





Western Digital ramping up merger talks

Western Digital (NASDAQ: ) and Kioxia Holdings Corp are speeding up merger talks and discussing a deal structure as both companies continue to be pressured by a slump in demand for memory products, Reuters reported.

Excess inventory amid weak demand in the memory market hit both companies hard, and they believe that a single entity would be better positioned to compete against rivals like Samsung (KS: ) Electronics (OTC: ).

The merged entity would be 43% owned by Kioxia, 37% by Western Digital and the rest by existing shareholders of the companies, Reuters added.

Benchmark reiterated a Hold rating on Western Digital, noting, ""While the devil will be in the details, due to the current depressed memory market, short-term we see modest upside from such a deal with most of the value coming from the HDD unit spin-out.""

Shares rose 7.3% for the week to $38.32.

OpenAI chief 'nervous' about AI election interference

CEO of Microsoft (NASDAQ: )-backed OpenAI, Sam Altman, said he is ""nervous"" about the potential for artificial intelligence to interfere with elections at a Senate panel on Tuesday - and said the U.S. should mull rules, licensing and testing requirements for AI development.

Sen. Cory Booker (D) said of AI, ""There's no way to put this genie in the bottle. Globally, this is exploding.""

In response to Sen. Mazie Hirono's (D) mention of an AI-generated video of former President Trump being arrested, Altman said creators should make clear when an image is generated rather than factual.

Altman also said companies should be able to protect their data from being used for AI training - but that public materials on the internet should be left open for these purposes.

Microsoft shares were up 3% for the week to $318.34.

Alibaba posts disappointing earnings

Hong Kong-listed shares of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (NYSE: ) (HK: ) sank on Friday as a slowing economic rebound and growing competition in China, its biggest market, spurred .

The firm logged revenue of RMB208.20 billion ($1 = RMB7.04) for the three months to March 31, lower than analyst estimates of RMB210.3B. Its revenue for the year to March 31 also rose just 2% to RMB868.69B, its worst pace of growth since the company listed in 2014.

Alibaba’s Chinese direct sales, which make up the biggest portion of its revenue, fell 1% in the quarter, as consumer spending in China continued to struggle despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures.

Alibaba's New York-traded ADRs were down 3.7% for the week to $83.98. Its Hong Kong-traded shares sank 1.6%.

In 2017, Vice Media had raised $450 million, valuing the media company at around $5.7 billion.

To facilitate the sale, Vice filed voluntary petitions for reorganisation under Chapter 11 in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.

All of its multi-platform media brands, including Vice, Vice News, Vice TV, Vice Studios, Pulse Films, Virtue, Refinery29 and i-D, will continue to produce and deliver award-winning content across platforms.

""We will have new ownership, a simplified capital structure and the ability to operate without the legacy liabilities that have been burdening our business,"" said Bruce Dixon and Hozefa Lokhandwala, Co-Chief Executive Officers.

""We look forward to completing the sale process in the next two to three months and charting a healthy and successful next chapter at Vice,"" they added.

Last month, Vice Media laid off more than 100 employees as part of restructuring its global organisations, along with shutting down its Vice News Tonight broadcast.

Vice joins a growing list of media companies which shut down businesses and laid off employees recently amid the global macroeconomic conditions.

Several media outlets, like ABC News, NPR, Vox Media, CNN and others have laid off staff members in recent months.

Vice Media Group is a multi-platform media company. Its Emmy and Peabody Award-winning News division just launched its fourth season of VICE on Paramount+ with Showtime and its coverage of the war in Ukraine has been watched on TikTok by hundreds of millions of people.

Its studio group, including Pulse Films, produced Bamarush for HBO Max, Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now for Netflix (NASDAQ: ), American Gladiators for ESPN, Gangs of London for Sky, and Tell Me Lies for Hulu.

2022-05-15, Bloomberg,Strong Tech Earnings Fail to Quell Investor Worries Over Growth and Valuation,https://in.investing.com/news/strong-tech-earnings-fail-to-quell-investor-worries-overgrowth-andvaluation-3645106,"(Bloomberg) -- One quarter down and it’s so far, so good for the tech sector.

Results this earnings season have mostly come in better than feared, and share prices have responded positively. Yet looking to the rest of the year, many investors continue to harbor concerns about growth and valuation.

Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust, is “very cautious” of the outlook for the sector, despite what he described as a “great” season for big tech. “You need to see additional growth to justify gains beyond what we’ve already seen, and that will be difficult,” he said.

The tech-heavy has risen less than 2% since April 18, when Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ). reported as the first of the widely watched technology and internet group, outpacing the S&P 500’s 0.8% decline over the same period. That’s extended the tech-heavy index’s year-to-date gain to 22%, pushing valuations to elevated levels. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). both saw pronounced post-earnings rallies, and are among the notable names trading at premiums to both the market and their own history.

The Nasdaq 100 Index was little changed on Monday.

Justifying such multiples could prove difficult in a slower-growth environment, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). strategists among those who expect a recession to reverse tech’s rally.

Sarfati cited a number of headwinds that could weigh on the sector beyond its valuation and growth prospects, including a wider fallout from turmoil in the banking sector, and inflation staying high and leading to a rebound in Treasury yields, a key headwind behind tech’s 2022 selloff.

“I worry about 2024 earnings because I don’t think estimates have been brought in enough, and there are only so many times tech can go to the cost-cutting well to generate upside,” he said. “I suspect headwinds will start blowing stronger and stronger until we really feel it.”

With concerns having been high ahead of earnings season, most tech companies have cleared a lowered bar. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 86% of those in the have topped estimates for profit, while 76% have for revenue.

Still, the full-year outlook is gloomy. Earnings for the S&P 500 tech sector are expected to decline 8.8% this year, while revenue is seen falling 1%, per Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with a drop of 2.5% for earnings in the overall S&P 500, which is expected to see revenue growth of 1.9% this year.

Growth in both earnings and revenue is expected to accelerate next year, eclipsing the pace of the S&P 500, but analysts have been trimming their 2024 expectations. Currently, they expect tech earnings growth of 15% in 2024, compared with the 16% pace expected a few weeks ago. Estimates for revenue growth have also come down.

With stocks rising and profit estimates falling, the tech sector is getting more expensive. At 24 times projected earnings, the Nasdaq 100 is above its long-term average and within spitting distance of the highest in more than a year.

“People have been hiding out in big tech, but now a lot of expectations have been built into the idea of them as stable growers, and they will have to live up to that to continue to support these valuations,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE: ). “This has been a good earnings season relative to our worst fears, but the growth rate is naturally slowing, and if there is a more material downdraft in fundamentals, the sector might be pressured.”

Meanwhile, Disney's flagship streaming service is hit by an exodus of subscribers and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issues another warning about the debt ceiling standoff.

1. Futures steady ahead of fresh inflation and labor market data

U.S. stock futures pointed slightly higher on Thursday, but hovered around the flatline, with investors looking ahead to the release of new data that should provide more detail into the state of inflation in the world's largest economy.

At 05:15 ET (09:15 GMT), the contract was up 37 points or 0.11%, traded 12 points or 0.30% higher, and gained 45 points or 0.34%.

The main indices registered a mixed close on Wednesday after data showed that U.S. growth eased marginally in April, but was still well above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. However, the slowing helped bolster expectations that the would push pause on a long-running interest rate hiking cycle at its next policy meeting in June.

More clarity on the outlook for inflation is expected later today in the form of the latest producer price index (see below). Fresh weekly numbers may also give a glimpse into another area of concern for the Fed: the strength of the U.S. labor market.

2. Investors eye PPI

Economists project that the - a measure of inflation at the wholesale level - will show a month-on-month uptick of 0.3% in April, up from a surprise decline of 0.5% in March.

But on an annual basis, the is expected to rise 2.4%, cooling from the prior month, when the gauge slowed to its smallest year-on-year increase since January 2021.

Should this forecast come to pass, it could add more credence to the emerging narrative that the Fed can afford to halt (even if temporarily) its aggressive policy tightening campaign.

3. BoE stares down stubborn inflation

Across the pond, the Bank of England is holding its latest policy-setting meeting, with policymakers expected to sign off on a 12th consecutive hike in borrowing costs.

Economists widely tip the to hike rates by a further 25 basis points, following in the footsteps of both the Fed and the .

The in the country jumped by an annualized rate of 10.1% in March, above any other major economy, although the BoE anticipates that inflation will decelerate sharply by the end of the year.

4. Subscribers ditch Disney+

Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ) shares slipped by more than 5% in premarket trading after the entertainment giant reported its largest ever quarterly drop in subscribers to its flagship Disney+ streaming service.

Four million customers left the service in the January to March period, bringing total subscribers down to 157.8 million. The loss of the rights to stream Indian Premier League cricket games was cited as one of the main reasons for the defections.

Price hikes also convinced subscribers to ditch the service, although the move helped Disney+ generate a three-month loss of $659 million which was an improvement from the $1 billion decline registered in the prior quarter.

Analysts fretted over what the exodus could mean for the division's ability to post a profit in the face of fierce competition from rivals like Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ).

5. Yellen warns of the ""unthinkable""

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has issued yet another dire warning about what awaits the country if lawmakers fail to reach an agreement to lift the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit.

Speaking in Japan ahead of a meeting of G7 finance ministers, Yellen said a U.S. default on its debt obligations could lead to ""dreadful consequences"" that would damage Washington's leadership credentials and impact the global economy.

""I think it should be regarded by everyone as unthinkable,"" she added.

Despite Yellen's sentiments, U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican leaders in Congress appear no closer to ending their standoff, with both sides at odds over federal spending plans."

2022-05-15, Bloomberg,Strong Tech Earnings Fail to Quell Investor Worries Over Growth and Valuation,https://in.investing.com/news/strong-tech-earnings-fail-to-quell-investor-worries-overgrowth-andvaluation-3645106,"(Bloomberg) -- One quarter down and it’s so far, so good for the tech sector.

Results this earnings season have mostly come in better than feared, and share prices have responded positively. Yet looking to the rest of the year, many investors continue to harbor concerns about growth and valuation.

Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust, is “very cautious” of the outlook for the sector, despite what he described as a “great” season for big tech. “You need to see additional growth to justify gains beyond what we’ve already seen, and that will be difficult,” he said.

The tech-heavy has risen less than 2% since April 18, when Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ). reported as the first of the widely watched technology and internet group, outpacing the S&P 500’s 0.8% decline over the same period. That’s extended the tech-heavy index’s year-to-date gain to 22%, pushing valuations to elevated levels. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). both saw pronounced post-earnings rallies, and are among the notable names trading at premiums to both the market and their own history.

The Nasdaq 100 Index was little changed on Monday.

Justifying such multiples could prove difficult in a slower-growth environment, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). strategists among those who expect a recession to reverse tech’s rally.

Sarfati cited a number of headwinds that could weigh on the sector beyond its valuation and growth prospects, including a wider fallout from turmoil in the banking sector, and inflation staying high and leading to a rebound in Treasury yields, a key headwind behind tech’s 2022 selloff.

“I worry about 2024 earnings because I don’t think estimates have been brought in enough, and there are only so many times tech can go to the cost-cutting well to generate upside,” he said. “I suspect headwinds will start blowing stronger and stronger until we really feel it.”

With concerns having been high ahead of earnings season, most tech companies have cleared a lowered bar. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 86% of those in the have topped estimates for profit, while 76% have for revenue.

Still, the full-year outlook is gloomy. Earnings for the S&P 500 tech sector are expected to decline 8.8% this year, while revenue is seen falling 1%, per Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with a drop of 2.5% for earnings in the overall S&P 500, which is expected to see revenue growth of 1.9% this year.

Growth in both earnings and revenue is expected to accelerate next year, eclipsing the pace of the S&P 500, but analysts have been trimming their 2024 expectations. Currently, they expect tech earnings growth of 15% in 2024, compared with the 16% pace expected a few weeks ago. Estimates for revenue growth have also come down.

With stocks rising and profit estimates falling, the tech sector is getting more expensive. At 24 times projected earnings, the Nasdaq 100 is above its long-term average and within spitting distance of the highest in more than a year.

“People have been hiding out in big tech, but now a lot of expectations have been built into the idea of them as stable growers, and they will have to live up to that to continue to support these valuations,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial (NYSE: ). “This has been a good earnings season relative to our worst fears, but the growth rate is naturally slowing, and if there is a more material downdraft in fundamentals, the sector might be pressured.”

Yoon is the first South Korean President since Lee Myung-bak in 2011 to pay a state visit to the US and the second foreign leader after French President Emmanuel Macron to pay such a visit under American President Joe Biden's administration, reports Yonhap News Agency.

Under the theme ""alliance in action, toward the future"", the visit comes at a time of growing concern over North Korea's evolving nuclear and missile capabilities and questions about the credibility of Washington's ""extended deterrence"" commitment to Seoul.

A joint statement on measures to enhance extended deterrence -- or the US commitment to mobilizing the full range of its military capabilities, including nuclear, to defend its ally -- is expected to be a highlight of Yoon's summit with Biden at the White House on Wednesday.

The summit will be preceded by an official arrival ceremony and followed by a state dinner hosted by Biden and First Lady Jill Biden.

Yoon will be joined by First Lady Kim Keon Hee.

The summit will mark the sixth meeting between Yoon and Biden, following those in Seoul last May and then in Madrid, London, New York and Phnom Penh.

The South Korean leader is being accompanied by a 122-person business delegation made up of chiefs of conglomerates, including Samsung Electronics (KS: ) Executive Chairman Lee Jae-yong, SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung, and the heads of six major business associations, including the Federation of Korean Industries and the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others.

On Tuesday, Yoon will attend a ceremony where US advanced technology firms will announce plans to invest in South Korea, and a business roundtable involving some 30 CEOs of major companies from both countries, including Samsung, SK, Hyundai, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Lam Research and Boeing (NYSE: ).

The President will also visit the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center just outside Washington the same day to discuss space cooperation between the two countries and meet with Korean scientists working for NASA.

The 70th anniversary of the alliance will be a theme that runs through the visit, with Yoon and First Lady Kim set to join the Bidens on a visit to the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington on Tuesday.

On Thursday, he will deliver an address before a joint session of Congress and look back on the past 70 years of an alliance rooted in the shared values of liberal democracy, the rule of law and human rights, address the challenges the two countries face and present a blueprint for the alliance's way forward.

He will then have lunch with Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken before moving to an undisclosed location to receive a briefing from US military leaders.

Also on Thursday, he will attend a global video content leadership forum to present a vision for cultural solidarity and cooperation between the two countries, and meet with officials from American mass media companies, such as Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, NBCUniversal Media, Sony Pictures, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the past week's biggest tech headlines you may have missed on InvestingPro: earnings out of Tesla and IBM; sour forecasts from Netflix and TSMC; and potential bad news for Alphabet.

Get this news in real time with InvestingPro.

Tesla's big miss

Tesla (NASDAQ: ) was sliding last week on CEO Elon Musk's vow to continue cutting prices on the company's electric vehicles, even though those price cuts led to a sizable earnings miss for Q1.

Musk said the price cuts are intended to heighten demand, even though they are hurting margins. More than a dozen Wall Street analysts lowered their price targets on Tesla, and at least two (Truist and Tudor Pickering) outright cut their ratings on the stock.

Shares tumbled 11.4% for the week to close at $65.08, and other automakers slid in sympathy as well.

Netflix trips on a delay

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) took a fall, as well, on a disappointing forecast due to a delay in its attempt to resolve the widespread user habit of password sharing among Netflix accounts.

Still, analysts feel that the solution should ultimately yield long-term gains once it rolls out, despite the likelihood that some users may react by canceling their subscriptions.

Shares were off some 3% for the week on the news.

A 'sigh of relief' for IBM

""Investors blew a sigh of relief that IBM's quarterly update was better than feared,"" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com.

BMO analysts cut the price target on IBM stock to $145 per share from the prior $155, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) analysts also slashed the price and remain cautious on rich valuation.

Shares spiked higher on the news, but ended the week down by 2% at $25.73.

Apple supplier warns of a demand hit

Chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (BVMF: ) (NYSE: ) flagged slowing demand in its fourth-quarter results in January, and said it would cut its capital spending in 2022 to between $32B and $36B from $36.3B in the prior year.

Netflix upgraded at UBS following Q1 revenue & guidance miss

UBS upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $390.00 from $350.00 following the company’s reported worse-than-expected Q1 revenue results and guidance yesterday.

The company Q1 revenue of $8.16 billion, below the consensus of $8.17B, while EPS of $2.88 came in better than the consensus of $2.86. Global streaming paid net additions were 1.75 million, missing the consensus estimates of around 2.41M.

For Q2, the company expects revenue of $8.24B, below the consensus estimate of $8.47B.

Shares are currently trading just around 1% lower pre-market, after recovering from a nearly 11% after-hours loss.

UBS sees Netflix as the main beneficiary of easing competition in DTC as peers focus on profits, noting it believes this will drive upside to subs/pricing power in the coming years while also keeping a lid on content costs.

The firm expects Netflix revenue growth to re-accelerate to 10%+ while driving 200-300 bps of annual margin expansion amid relatively stable content spend. UBS anticipates this will drive a 20%+ profit CAGR and $6.1B/$8.4B of FCF in 2024/2025.

ExxonMobil upgraded to Buy ahead of the Q1 report

UBS upgraded ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $144.00 from $125.00.

The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings results on April 28. Consensus estimates stand at $2.61 for EPS and $82.66B for revenues.

JMP Securities upgrades LegalZoom.com , says share gains can accelerate through 2022

JMP Securities upgraded LegalZoom.com (NASDAQ: ) to Market Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $14.00 as the company has fully rolled out “free” in its marketing, which the firm believes can accelerate share gains through 2022.

According to the firm, improved freemium attach rates, improving share gains (including Q1/23 traffic share), and continued expense discipline have alleviated the concerns it had at the time of the downgrade.

Shares closed more than 9% higher yesterday.

2 more upgrades

Mizuho Securities upgraded Immuneering (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $20.00 from $10.00 following a presentation of IMM-1-104 data at AACR, which resulted in a share price gain of more than 9% yesterday.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Equalweight from Underweight and raised its price target to $14.00 from $5.00.

Baird upgraded Global Payments (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $156.00 from $130.00.

2022-04-19, Investing.com,"Netflix adds, Fox lawsuit and U.K. inflation - what's moving markets",https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-adds-fox-lawsuit-and-uk-inflation--whats-moving-markets-3605548,"By Peter Nurse

Investing.com -- Netflix disappointed with the extent of its subscriber additions in the first quarter, while Fox settled its defamation lawsuit by Dominion, taking a hefty financial hit in the process. Tesla earnings are due after the close, while U.K. inflation is proving to be particularly sticky.

1. Netflix disappoints with guidance, subscriber adds

The new earnings season received results from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) after the close Tuesday, and while the streaming giant’s topped estimates, its guidance fell short of expectations even after the launch of its ad-supported tier.

Netflix also added 1.75 million users, compared with a loss of 200,000 in the same period last year, but that missed estimates of over 2M net adds. It also forecast that second quarter paid net adds were expected to be “roughly similar to Q1 ’23.”

The company serves as a bellwether for the streaming industry, in which growth has slowed as competition has intensified. Its stock fell 1% in after-hours trading.

There are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including major lender Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) before the open and electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ: ) after the closing bell.

2. Fox settles Dominion lawsuit

Fox Corp. (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Fox News, has settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, the largest ever settlement struck by an American media company.

Dominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021 over the media giant’s coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election.

As expensive as this settlement is, Fox’s lawyers must have thought it still represented a good deal given that alongside the $1.6B, Dominion was also seeking punitive damages in any amount jurors see fit.

Additionally, the deal spared a number of well-known Fox employees, including the company’s 92-year-old chairman Rupert Murdoch, from having to answer potentially embarrassing questions.

While this agreement ends this particular lawsuit, another U.S. voting company, Smartmatic, is seeking $2.7B from Fox in a similar lawsuit pending in New York County Supreme Court.

The fact Fox chose to settle is likely to provide Smartmatic with confidence of a similar result.

Fox stock fell 1.5% in premarket trading.

3. Futures lower; Tesla earnings in focus

U.S. futures traded lower Wednesday, as investors digested mixed earnings reports from a number of major companies.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract dropped 110 points or 0.3%, fell 18 points or 0.4%, and retreated 75 points or 0.6%.

While (NYSE: ) and (NYSE: ) beat expectations Tuesday, other big companies such as (NYSE: ) and Netflix [see above] fell short on some measures.

Tesla leads the earnings schedule Wednesday after the close, and investors will also pay attention to the release of the Fed’s later in the session as it could provide more color for investors on the economic conditions around the country.

4. U.K. inflation remains particularly sticky

The U.K. received another nasty inflation surprise Wednesday, as its March CPI remained in double figures, western Europe's highest rate of consumer price inflation.

Data released earlier Wednesday showed came in at 10.1% in March, a small drop from February's 10.4%, and above the forecast 9.8%.

This elevated level was largely driven by prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by 19.1% in annual terms in March - the biggest such increase since August 1977.

Last month the Bank of England said it expected inflation to ""fall significantly"" in the second quarter, forecasting March inflation of 9.2%, and thus this number is likely to prompt the to raise interest rates next month once more.

Sterling rose as a result, with up 0.2% to 1.2435.

The final iteration of the Eurozone’s March consumer price index was also released earlier Wednesday, with the rising 0.9% on the month in March, an of 6.9%, a drop from the 8.5% seen in February.

5. Oil prices drop on fears of slowing U.S. growth

Crude prices weakened Wednesday, weighed by concerns that another hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve will hit economic activity in the world’s largest economy and major oil consumer.

By 09:00 ET, futures were down 1.8% at $79.40 a barrel, while the contract fell 1.8% to $83.25 per barrel.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard called Tuesday for continued hikes to counter persistent , while his colleague Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic suggested one more interest rate rise of 25 basis points was likely in May.

There was some good news Tuesday, as an industry report from the showed U.S. crude stocks fell about 2.68M barrels last week.

The official inventory report by the is due to be released at 10:30 ET."

Netflix upgraded at UBS following Q1 revenue & guidance miss

UBS upgraded Netflix (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $390.00 from $350.00 following the company’s reported worse-than-expected Q1 revenue results and guidance yesterday.

The company Q1 revenue of $8.16 billion, below the consensus of $8.17B, while EPS of $2.88 came in better than the consensus of $2.86. Global streaming paid net additions were 1.75 million, missing the consensus estimates of around 2.41M.

For Q2, the company expects revenue of $8.24B, below the consensus estimate of $8.47B.

Shares are currently trading just around 1% lower pre-market, after recovering from a nearly 11% after-hours loss.

UBS sees Netflix as the main beneficiary of easing competition in DTC as peers focus on profits, noting it believes this will drive upside to subs/pricing power in the coming years while also keeping a lid on content costs.

The firm expects Netflix revenue growth to re-accelerate to 10%+ while driving 200-300 bps of annual margin expansion amid relatively stable content spend. UBS anticipates this will drive a 20%+ profit CAGR and $6.1B/$8.4B of FCF in 2024/2025.

ExxonMobil upgraded to Buy ahead of the Q1 report

UBS upgraded ExxonMobil (NYSE: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $144.00 from $125.00.

The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings results on April 28. Consensus estimates stand at $2.61 for EPS and $82.66B for revenues.

JMP Securities upgrades LegalZoom.com , says share gains can accelerate through 2022

JMP Securities upgraded LegalZoom.com (NASDAQ: ) to Market Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $14.00 as the company has fully rolled out “free” in its marketing, which the firm believes can accelerate share gains through 2022.

According to the firm, improved freemium attach rates, improving share gains (including Q1/23 traffic share), and continued expense discipline have alleviated the concerns it had at the time of the downgrade.

Shares closed more than 9% higher yesterday.

2 more upgrades

Mizuho Securities upgraded Immuneering (NASDAQ: ) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $20.00 from $10.00 following a presentation of IMM-1-104 data at AACR, which resulted in a share price gain of more than 9% yesterday.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley upgraded the company to Equalweight from Underweight and raised its price target to $14.00 from $5.00.

Baird upgraded Global Payments (NYSE: ) to Outperform from Neutral and raised its price target to $156.00 from $130.00.

Investing.com -- Netflix disappointed with the extent of its subscriber additions in the first quarter, while Fox settled its defamation lawsuit by Dominion, taking a hefty financial hit in the process. Tesla earnings are due after the close, while U.K. inflation is proving to be particularly sticky.

1. Netflix disappoints with guidance, subscriber adds

The new earnings season received results from Netflix (NASDAQ: ) after the close Tuesday, and while the streaming giant’s topped estimates, its guidance fell short of expectations even after the launch of its ad-supported tier.

Netflix also added 1.75 million users, compared with a loss of 200,000 in the same period last year, but that missed estimates of over 2M net adds. It also forecast that second quarter paid net adds were expected to be “roughly similar to Q1 ’23.”

The company serves as a bellwether for the streaming industry, in which growth has slowed as competition has intensified. Its stock fell 1% in after-hours trading.

There are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including major lender Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) before the open and electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ: ) after the closing bell.

2. Fox settles Dominion lawsuit

Fox Corp. (NASDAQ: ), the owner of Fox News, has settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million, the largest ever settlement struck by an American media company.

Dominion had sought $1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021 over the media giant’s coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election.

As expensive as this settlement is, Fox’s lawyers must have thought it still represented a good deal given that alongside the $1.6B, Dominion was also seeking punitive damages in any amount jurors see fit.

Additionally, the deal spared a number of well-known Fox employees, including the company’s 92-year-old chairman Rupert Murdoch, from having to answer potentially embarrassing questions.

While this agreement ends this particular lawsuit, another U.S. voting company, Smartmatic, is seeking $2.7B from Fox in a similar lawsuit pending in New York County Supreme Court.

The fact Fox chose to settle is likely to provide Smartmatic with confidence of a similar result.

Fox stock fell 1.5% in premarket trading.

3. Futures lower; Tesla earnings in focus

U.S. futures traded lower Wednesday, as investors digested mixed earnings reports from a number of major companies.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract dropped 110 points or 0.3%, fell 18 points or 0.4%, and retreated 75 points or 0.6%.

While (NYSE: ) and (NYSE: ) beat expectations Tuesday, other big companies such as (NYSE: ) and Netflix [see above] fell short on some measures.

Tesla leads the earnings schedule Wednesday after the close, and investors will also pay attention to the release of the Fed’s later in the session as it could provide more color for investors on the economic conditions around the country.

4. U.K. inflation remains particularly sticky

The U.K. received another nasty inflation surprise Wednesday, as its March CPI remained in double figures, western Europe's highest rate of consumer price inflation.

Data released earlier Wednesday showed came in at 10.1% in March, a small drop from February's 10.4%, and above the forecast 9.8%.

This elevated level was largely driven by prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by 19.1% in annual terms in March - the biggest such increase since August 1977.

Last month the Bank of England said it expected inflation to ""fall significantly"" in the second quarter, forecasting March inflation of 9.2%, and thus this number is likely to prompt the to raise interest rates next month once more.

Sterling rose as a result, with up 0.2% to 1.2435.

The final iteration of the Eurozone’s March consumer price index was also released earlier Wednesday, with the rising 0.9% on the month in March, an of 6.9%, a drop from the 8.5% seen in February.

5. Oil prices drop on fears of slowing U.S. growth

Crude prices weakened Wednesday, weighed by concerns that another hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve will hit economic activity in the world’s largest economy and major oil consumer.

By 09:00 ET, futures were down 1.8% at $79.40 a barrel, while the contract fell 1.8% to $83.25 per barrel.

Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard called Tuesday for continued hikes to counter persistent , while his colleague Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic suggested one more interest rate rise of 25 basis points was likely in May.

There was some good news Tuesday, as an industry report from the showed U.S. crude stocks fell about 2.68M barrels last week.

Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell more than 8% in afterhours trading following the report.

Netflix announced per share of $2.88 on revenue of $8.16 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $2.86 on revenue of $8.47 billion.

Netflix added 1.75 million users, missing analyst estimates of about 2.41M net adds.

Looking ahead, the streaming giant said its revenue of $8.2B is up 3% year over year, but short of analysts' expectations.

The subdued outlook on second-quarter revenue comes as the streaming giant was expected to have benefited from the launch of an ad-supported tier and a crackdown on password sharing.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening with gains Tuesday, with investors boosted by healthy earnings from Bank of America, continuing the run of U.S. big banks topping estimates.

At 07:05 ET (11:05 GMT), the contract was up 135 points, or 0.4%, traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.6%.

The main indices closed higher Monday as the banking sector’s quarterly earnings continued, with Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) beating expectations but an 11% drop in deposits from the fourth quarter, underscoring the trend of depositors moving their assets to the largest, seemingly more secure, banks.

The blue chip closed 100 points, or 0.3% higher, while both the broad-based and the tech-heavy also gained 0.3%.

Bank of America (NYSE: ) followed the path set by JPMorgan (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) last week, and released strong quarterly earnings, earning more from customers' interest payments while the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is also due to release its numbers before the open Tuesday.

Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) is also scheduled to report, but the day’s highlight is likely to come after the close, in the form of quarterly results from streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

Investing.com -- China's economic recovery appears on track following the release of stronger than expected growth data. However, investors are awaiting the release of more corporate earnings, including from Netflix, with a degree of caution as they could point to a more financially stressed consumer.

1. China’s recovery on track

Risk sentiment received a boost Tuesday after growth data showed that China’s economic recovery from the slowdown caused in part by its severe COVID restrictions was fully on track.

China’s first quarter grew 4.5% on an annual basis in the first three months of 2022, more than expectations of 4% and the previous quarter’s growth.

The recovery appears to be a little uneven, as grew slightly less than expected in March, but blew past expectations, surging 10.6% in March against estimates for growth of 7.4%.

Investors have been banking on growth in the second largest economy in the world to pick up the slack caused by western economies contracting under the weight of aggressive hikes to combat .

2. Earnings pick up, with Netflix the highlight

There are more significant quarterly earnings for investors to digest Tuesday, including more of the major U.S. banks as well as streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

The financial sector has been under scrutiny since March's turmoil and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) and Bank of America (NYSE: ) report later in the day, looking to follow in the path of JPMorgan (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), who all beat Wall Street forecasts.

That said, the sectorial news hasn’t been universally good, with State Street (NYSE: ) stock falling more than 9% overnight after fee income fell as investors responded to the turbulence by moving their deposits to the largest banks.

Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) is also scheduled to report, and analysts will be listening for updates on its proposed settlement of talc-related litigation.

The day’s highlight, however, is likely to come after the close, in the form of quarterly results from streaming giant Netflix. The focus will also be on subscriber numbers, and the company is expected to have added some 2 million subscribers in the first quarter.

Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter but returned to subscriber growth in the second half of 2022 even if the pace of additions slowed dramatically.

3. Futures edge higher; caution ahead of earnings

U.S. futures edged higher Tuesday, as investors brace for another batch of quarterly earnings, including from the popular streaming platform Netflix [see above].

At 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the contract had gained 59 points or 0.7%, inched up 5 points or 0.3%, and added 8 points or 0.0%.

Aside from the corporate sector, investors will also be keeping an eye on the real estate market, with March economic data in the form of and due.

Investors will also be listening to what an array of Fed officials will be saying in speeches this week, with FOMC member scheduled to speak later in the session.

4. U.K. unemployment edges up, pay growth still high

Britain's rose unexpectedly in the three months to February, climbing to 3.8% rather than holding at January’s 3.7%.

This is the highest level since the second quarter of 2022, and suggests that the country’s red-hot labor market may be loosening.

That said, annual for the three months to February came in at 5.9%, well above the 5.1% forecast, and the same as the revised higher January figure.

This highlights the dilemma facing the ahead of May’s rate-setting meeting.

Wednesday sees the release of the official for March. They are expected to fall back from February’s 10.4%, but will remain highly elevated. This suggests the BoE will continue to hike rates even with no economic growth last quarter and as unemployment starts to grow.

5. Oil prices retreat despite strong Chinese growth data

Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the recent gains despite stronger than expected economic growth in China [see above], the world’s largest crude importer.

By 04:00 ET, futures were 0.3% lower at $80.59 a barrel, while the contract edged lower by 0.3% to $84.50 per barrel. Both benchmarks are up over 16% this month.

Aside from China’s GDP growth, additional data showed that the country’s refiners processed 63.29 million tons of crude in March, up 8.8% on a yearly basis and the highest ever for that particular month.

The last week forecast record demand in 2022, largely predicated on the recovery of the Chinese economy after the lifting of its zero-COVID policy.

Elsewhere, the , an industry body, will release its weekly forecast of U.S. crude stocks later in the session, with a drop of around 2.5 million barrels expected."

M&T Bank (NYSE: ) rallied more than 7% as its quarterly beat on both the top and bottom lines, while State Street Corp (NYSE: ) fell 9% after its first-quarter fell short of estimates.

But a 2% slip in Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) stifled upside momentum on reports that Samsung (KS: ) is mulling ditching Google’s search for Microsoft's (NASDAQ: ) Bing as the default search engine on its devices, threatening about $3 billion in annual revenue, the New York Times reported.

Apple (NASDAQ: ) closed just above the flatline as the tech giant announced that it would launch a savings account for Apple card users.

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) slipped more than 1% ahead of its quarterly results on Tuesday after markets close, with some on Wall Street keen for updates on the streaming giant’s crackdown on password sharing.

Sentiment on growth corners of the market including tech was also weighed down by a jump in Treasury amid growing fears about further Federal Reserve rate hikes.

“We continue to expect a 25 bp rate hike at the May FOMC meeting,” UBS said, adding that an unexpected pause from the Fed would likely be driven by concern “over the banking system and credit.”

The odds of a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed’s May 3 meeting is nearly priced in, according to Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

Investing.com -- Stocks were rising heading into the close on Monday after a choppy day of trading as investors scoured earnings reports from banks.

The financial sector has been under scrutiny since March's turmoil involving the collapse of two big U.S. banks and Credit Suisse (SIX: )'s rescue by rival UBS (NYSE: ). Concerns about the banking system encouraged some people to move their deposits to the largest banks or to find other places to put their deposits that pay higher yields. Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) beat earnings expectations on Monday but reported an 11% drop in deposits from the , underscoring this trend.

Analysts will be focusing on reports from regional banks such as Comerica (NYSE: ) later this week for similar trends.

Investors will also be listening to what an array of Fed officials will be saying in speeches this week. The Fed is expected to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point when it meets in May, but the outlook is uncertain after that. If economic conditions soften further, the Fed could be nearing a pause in its rate hiking.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Netflix reports

Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.86 on revenue of $8.17 billion, though analysts will be waiting for its update on content spending and on its efforts to crack down on password sharing. The focus will also be on subscriber numbers.

Q1 earnings season is officially underway

The Q1 earnings season has officially started after several banking titans reported on their Q1 performance on Friday. JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ) shares rallied on strong numbers while Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) struggled to rally amid a more conservative outlook.

Analysts widely expect Q1 to mark the second consecutive quarter of negative year-over-year (YoY) earnings growth and the third consecutive quarter of negative quarter-over-quarter. The earnings growth is expected to be the lowest YoY growth rate since 2020 Q3.

“The US economy is slowing and a recession is certainly possible (although the downturn probably won’t be as deep as some fear, and regardless, stocks care more about earnings than GDP),” Vital Knowledge analysts said Monday.

The most notable earnings reports for this week include:

Monday: Charles Schwab (NYSE: ), State Street (NYSE: );

Tuesday: Bank of America (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), United Airlines (NASDAQ: );

Wednesday: Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), IBM (NYSE: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: );

Thursday: American Express (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: );

Friday: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), Schlumberger (NYSE: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks:

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our continued optimism is predicated on three main beliefs: 1) the GDP/economic and EPS cycles have become unusually disjointed, with the latter bolstered by five critical tailwinds (aggressive cost cutting, normalized supply chain conditions, less FX pressure, cleaner inventories, and better China demand) despite incremental weakness in the former (there’s way too much focus on a US recession/hard landing and not nearly enough appreciation of the nuances of this particular earnings cycle); 2) inflation and monetary policy globally are at a dovish inflection point; and 3) favorable technical factors remain in place (extremely negative sentiment + lean long positioning).”

JPMorgan analysts: “After being bullish on Value style last year, this year we believe one should be UW Value style, and we also expect that Q1 will be marking the peak of the beta/Cyclicals rally – we have recently called for a reduction in the portfolio beta. We believe Growth and Defensives will be favored in 2H.”

BTIG analysts: “The weak parts of the market remain weak, while the strong parts now appear vulnerable. This is typical of bear markets, and why things happen ‘slowly, then all at once’. Meanwhile, short-term volatility (VIX9D) hit the lowest level since Jan. ’22. As we wrote last week, unless this is a regime change, this should be a headwind for equities. As we discussed last Wednesday, we think we are currently seeing an ‘inverse October playbook’ where the cooler than expected CPI report essentially marks the high, just as October’s hotter than expected CPI report marked the low.”

Roth MKM analysts: “The S&P 500 is becoming tactically overbought as it approaches 4,200. We are seeing signs of internal breadth divergences starting to develop on the charts. We look to hear from companies reporting earnings to see how business is holding up in front of a widely anticipated recession. A weaker dollar is becoming a catalyst.”

Morgan Stanley analysts: “To those investors cheering the softer-than-expected inflation data last week, we would say be careful what you wish for. Falling inflation last week, especially for goods, is a sign of waning demand, and inflation is the one thing holding up revenue growth for many businesses. The gradually eroding margins to date have been mostly a function of bloated cost structures. If/when revenues begin to disappoint, that margin degradation can be much more sudden, and that’s when the market can suddenly get in front of the earnings decline we are forecasting, too.”"

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street on Monday as investors awaited corporate earnings reports, including more bank results as well as remarks from Federal Reserve officials which could offer insights into the future path of interest rates.

At 06:42 ET (10:42 GMT), the contract was up 20 points or 0.1%, were flat, and dipped 16 points or 0.1%.

Wall Street ended lower on Friday as mixed economic data cemented expectations for another from the Fed in May, dampening investor enthusiasm after a series of big U.S. bank earnings kicked off first quarter earnings season.

While banking heavyweights including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) benefitted from higher interest payments, focus will be on smaller banks that were at the center of last month's turmoil in the financial sector.

Major U.S. banks including Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) will report through the week, while Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) and State Street (NYSE: ) are among the financial companies reporting ahead of the open on Monday.

But investor focus may now turn to how more consumer discretionary companies are faring given persistently high and the Fed's aggressive rate-hiking cycle.

Results from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) this week could easily disrupt the optimism generated by Friday's strong bank numbers.

Several central bank policymakers including New York Fed President and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are due to speak later in the week, with investors on the lookout for their assessment on the risk of a recession and when rate hikes may pause.

Investing.com -- Big banks continue to divulge their earnings this week, but are also joined by quarterly results from a number of more consumer-facing companies. There are also comments from a plethora of central bank speakers to digest.

1. Earnings season starts in earnest

First-quarter earnings season hits full stride this week, after a number of major Wall Street banks reported better-than-expected results on Friday.

Several more big banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Bank of America (NYSE: ), are due in the next few days, but the focus may now turn to how more consumer discretionary companies are faring given persistently high inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle.

Results from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) and AutoNation (NYSE: ) are due this week, and could easily disrupt the optimism generated by Friday’s strong bank numbers.

Analysts expect earnings to have declined 4.8% in the first quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data Friday.

2. Central bankers speak

The major Western central banks–the , and –all have major policy decisions to make early next month, placing the focus firmly on comments from these policymakers before they enter their traditional blackout periods.

ECB President speaks in New York later Monday. Investors will be looking to see if she expands on Friday’s comment that “underlying inflationary pressures remain strong”, as opinions are divided on whether the Eurozone’s central bank will hike by 25 or 50 basis points in May.

, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for Financial Stability, is scheduled to speak Monday, just a couple of days before the release of the U.K.’s for March.

Inflation unexpectedly rose to 10.4% in February, largely cementing another rate increase next month, which would be the BoE’s twelfth consecutive rate increase since December 2021.

A number of Fed officials are also due to speak in the next few days, including New York Fed President , Governor , Governor and Governor .

3. Futures edge higher; stocks remain resilient

U.S. futures traded marginally higher Monday, with investors awaiting the release of more quarterly earnings which should provide strong clues about the health of corporate America.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract had gained 20 points or 0.1%, inched up 6 points or 0.1%, and added 10 points or 0.1%.

This is an important week for earnings [see above] with growth expectations pretty low following the Federal Reserve’s series of aggressive rate hikes in order to combat soaring inflation.

That said, stocks have remained resilient, with the positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the and both had their fourth up week in five.

4. SpaceX aims for the moon

Elon Musk's SpaceX is set to launch later Monday its new ultra-powerful Starship rocket system to space for the first time, in potentially another step forward in the company’s ambition of sending humans back to the moon and ultimately to Mars.

The aim of the launch, if conditions are right, is to provide crucial data about how the vehicle ascends to space and how it will fly back to Earth, with both the lower-stage Super Heavy booster rocket and the upper-stage Starship cruise vessel designed as reusable components, reducing the cost of future launches.

The optimism surrounding the SpaceX project contrasts vividly with the decision of Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit (OTC: ) to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month after the satellite launching business struggled to secure long-term funding following a failed launch in January.

The filing comes less than two years after Virgin Orbit went public at a valuation of roughly $3 billion.

5. Oil prices subdued ahead of Chinese growth data

Crude prices traded lower Monday, handing back some of the recent gains, as traders await the latest from China, the world’s largest crude importer.

By 05:00 ET, futures traded 0.4% lower to $82.09 a barrel, while the contract edged lower by 0.5% to $85.91 per barrel.

Both benchmarks recorded their fourth weekly gains last week, the longest such streak since mid-2022, continuing to be boosted by the output cuts announced by OPEC+ producers earlier this month.

The also helped sentiment last week by forecasting record demand in 2022, largely predicated on the recovery of the Chinese economy after the lifting of its zero-COVID policy.

With this in mind, the release of China’s first-quarter GDP early Tuesday is seen as key this week, as traders look for signs of demand recovery in the world's second-largest oil consumer."

Bank of America continued the stream of mostly upbeat quarterly results seen from Wall Street banks, but Goldman Sachs came under pressure after reporting mixed results.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening with gains Tuesday, with investors boosted by healthy earnings from Bank of America, continuing the run of U.S. big banks topping estimates.

At 07:05 ET (11:05 GMT), the contract was up 135 points, or 0.4%, traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher and climbed 80 points, or 0.6%.

The main indices closed higher Monday as the banking sector’s quarterly earnings continued, with Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) beating expectations but an 11% drop in deposits from the fourth quarter, underscoring the trend of depositors moving their assets to the largest, seemingly more secure, banks.

The blue chip closed 100 points, or 0.3% higher, while both the broad-based and the tech-heavy also gained 0.3%.

Bank of America (NYSE: ) followed the path set by JPMorgan (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) last week, and released strong quarterly earnings, earning more from customers' interest payments while the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) is also due to release its numbers before the open Tuesday.

Investing.com -- China's economic recovery appears on track following the release of stronger than expected growth data. However, investors are awaiting the release of more corporate earnings, including from Netflix, with a degree of caution as they could point to a more financially stressed consumer.

1. China’s recovery on track

Risk sentiment received a boost Tuesday after growth data showed that China’s economic recovery from the slowdown caused in part by its severe COVID restrictions was fully on track.

China’s first quarter grew 4.5% on an annual basis in the first three months of 2022, more than expectations of 4% and the previous quarter’s growth.

The recovery appears to be a little uneven, as grew slightly less than expected in March, but blew past expectations, surging 10.6% in March against estimates for growth of 7.4%.

Investors have been banking on growth in the second largest economy in the world to pick up the slack caused by western economies contracting under the weight of aggressive hikes to combat .

2. Earnings pick up, with Netflix the highlight

There are more significant quarterly earnings for investors to digest Tuesday, including more of the major U.S. banks as well as streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

The financial sector has been under scrutiny since March's turmoil and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) and Bank of America (NYSE: ) report later in the day, looking to follow in the path of JPMorgan (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ), who all beat Wall Street forecasts.

That said, the sectorial news hasn’t been universally good, with State Street (NYSE: ) stock falling more than 9% overnight after fee income fell as investors responded to the turbulence by moving their deposits to the largest banks.

Pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) is also scheduled to report, and analysts will be listening for updates on its proposed settlement of talc-related litigation.

The day’s highlight, however, is likely to come after the close, in the form of quarterly results from streaming giant Netflix. The focus will also be on subscriber numbers, and the company is expected to have added some 2 million subscribers in the first quarter.

Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the year-ago quarter but returned to subscriber growth in the second half of 2022 even if the pace of additions slowed dramatically.

3. Futures edge higher; caution ahead of earnings

U.S. futures edged higher Tuesday, as investors brace for another batch of quarterly earnings, including from the popular streaming platform Netflix [see above].

At 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the contract had gained 59 points or 0.7%, inched up 5 points or 0.3%, and added 8 points or 0.0%.

Aside from the corporate sector, investors will also be keeping an eye on the real estate market, with March economic data in the form of and due.

Investors will also be listening to what an array of Fed officials will be saying in speeches this week, with FOMC member scheduled to speak later in the session.

4. U.K. unemployment edges up, pay growth still high

Britain's rose unexpectedly in the three months to February, climbing to 3.8% rather than holding at January’s 3.7%.

This is the highest level since the second quarter of 2022, and suggests that the country’s red-hot labor market may be loosening.

That said, annual for the three months to February came in at 5.9%, well above the 5.1% forecast, and the same as the revised higher January figure.

This highlights the dilemma facing the ahead of May’s rate-setting meeting.

Wednesday sees the release of the official for March. They are expected to fall back from February’s 10.4%, but will remain highly elevated. This suggests the BoE will continue to hike rates even with no economic growth last quarter and as unemployment starts to grow.

5. Oil prices retreat despite strong Chinese growth data

Crude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the recent gains despite stronger than expected economic growth in China [see above], the world’s largest crude importer.

By 04:00 ET, futures were 0.3% lower at $80.59 a barrel, while the contract edged lower by 0.3% to $84.50 per barrel. Both benchmarks are up over 16% this month.

Aside from China’s GDP growth, additional data showed that the country’s refiners processed 63.29 million tons of crude in March, up 8.8% on a yearly basis and the highest ever for that particular month.

The last week forecast record demand in 2022, largely predicated on the recovery of the Chinese economy after the lifting of its zero-COVID policy.

Sentiment on growth corners of the market including tech was also weighed down by a jump in Treasury amid growing fears about further Federal Reserve rate hikes.

Investing.com -- Stocks were rising heading into the close on Monday after a choppy day of trading as investors scoured earnings reports from banks.

The financial sector has been under scrutiny since March's turmoil involving the collapse of two big U.S. banks and Credit Suisse (SIX: )'s rescue by rival UBS (NYSE: ). Concerns about the banking system encouraged some people to move their deposits to the largest banks or to find other places to put their deposits that pay higher yields. Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) beat earnings expectations on Monday but reported an 11% drop in deposits from the , underscoring this trend.

Analysts will be focusing on reports from regional banks such as Comerica (NYSE: ) later this week for similar trends.

Investors will also be listening to what an array of Fed officials will be saying in speeches this week. The Fed is expected to raise rates another quarter of a percentage point when it meets in May, but the outlook is uncertain after that. If economic conditions soften further, the Fed could be nearing a pause in its rate hiking.

Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:

1. Netflix reports

Streaming giant Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) is expected to report earnings per share of $2.86 on revenue of $8.17 billion, though analysts will be waiting for its update on content spending and on its efforts to crack down on password sharing. The focus will also be on subscriber numbers.

Big banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ) scored record revenue in the as rising rates helped boost interest income. But investors will be focused on results from smaller banks, and what they say about deposit outflows after turmoil in the banking sector in March.

A downturn in demand for loans could also pinch smaller banks if companies decide to scale back activity in case of a recession later this year.

Recent data showing a slowing U.S. economy have traders guessing at whether the Fed will pause its rate hikes after the May meeting. The New York Empire State Manufacturing Index a positive 10.8 in April, well above expectations and above the negative 24.6 in the prior reading.

Q1 earnings season is officially underway

The Q1 earnings season has officially started after several banking titans reported on their Q1 performance on Friday. JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Citigroup (NYSE: ) shares rallied on strong numbers while Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) struggled to rally amid a more conservative outlook.

Analysts widely expect Q1 to mark the second consecutive quarter of negative year-over-year (YoY) earnings growth and the third consecutive quarter of negative quarter-over-quarter. The earnings growth is expected to be the lowest YoY growth rate since 2020 Q3.

“The US economy is slowing and a recession is certainly possible (although the downturn probably won’t be as deep as some fear, and regardless, stocks care more about earnings than GDP),” Vital Knowledge analysts said Monday.

The most notable earnings reports for this week include:

Monday: Charles Schwab (NYSE: ), State Street (NYSE: );

Tuesday: Bank of America (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), United Airlines (NASDAQ: );

Wednesday: Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ), IBM (NYSE: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: );

Thursday: American Express (NYSE: ), AT&T (NYSE: );

Friday: Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ), Schlumberger (NYSE: ).

What analysts are saying about U.S. stocks:

Vital Knowledge analysts: “Our continued optimism is predicated on three main beliefs: 1) the GDP/economic and EPS cycles have become unusually disjointed, with the latter bolstered by five critical tailwinds (aggressive cost cutting, normalized supply chain conditions, less FX pressure, cleaner inventories, and better China demand) despite incremental weakness in the former (there’s way too much focus on a US recession/hard landing and not nearly enough appreciation of the nuances of this particular earnings cycle); 2) inflation and monetary policy globally are at a dovish inflection point; and 3) favorable technical factors remain in place (extremely negative sentiment + lean long positioning).”

JPMorgan analysts: “After being bullish on Value style last year, this year we believe one should be UW Value style, and we also expect that Q1 will be marking the peak of the beta/Cyclicals rally – we have recently called for a reduction in the portfolio beta. We believe Growth and Defensives will be favored in 2H.”

BTIG analysts: “The weak parts of the market remain weak, while the strong parts now appear vulnerable. This is typical of bear markets, and why things happen ‘slowly, then all at once’. Meanwhile, short-term volatility (VIX9D) hit the lowest level since Jan. ’22. As we wrote last week, unless this is a regime change, this should be a headwind for equities. As we discussed last Wednesday, we think we are currently seeing an ‘inverse October playbook’ where the cooler than expected CPI report essentially marks the high, just as October’s hotter than expected CPI report marked the low.”

Roth MKM analysts: “The S&P 500 is becoming tactically overbought as it approaches 4,200. We are seeing signs of internal breadth divergences starting to develop on the charts. We look to hear from companies reporting earnings to see how business is holding up in front of a widely anticipated recession. A weaker dollar is becoming a catalyst.”

Morgan Stanley analysts: “To those investors cheering the softer-than-expected inflation data last week, we would say be careful what you wish for. Falling inflation last week, especially for goods, is a sign of waning demand, and inflation is the one thing holding up revenue growth for many businesses. The gradually eroding margins to date have been mostly a function of bloated cost structures. If/when revenues begin to disappoint, that margin degradation can be much more sudden, and that’s when the market can suddenly get in front of the earnings decline we are forecasting, too.”"

Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures pointed to a flat open on Wall Street on Monday as investors awaited corporate earnings reports, including more bank results as well as remarks from Federal Reserve officials which could offer insights into the future path of interest rates.

At 06:42 ET (10:42 GMT), the contract was up 20 points or 0.1%, were flat, and dipped 16 points or 0.1%.

Wall Street ended lower on Friday as mixed economic data cemented expectations for another from the Fed in May, dampening investor enthusiasm after a series of big U.S. bank earnings kicked off first quarter earnings season.

Major U.S. banks including Goldman Sachs Group (NYSE: ), Bank of America (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) will report through the week, while Charles Schwab (NYSE: ) and State Street (NYSE: ) are among the financial companies reporting ahead of the open on Monday.

Results from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) this week could easily disrupt the optimism generated by Friday's strong bank numbers.

Several central bank policymakers including New York Fed President and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester are due to speak later in the week, with investors on the lookout for their assessment on the risk of a recession and when rate hikes may pause.

Stocks likely to be in focus include Prometheus Biosciences (NASDAQ: ) which surged in premarket trade after Merck (NYSE: ) said it is buying the biotech company for about $10.8 billion.

Investing.com -- Big banks continue to divulge their earnings this week, but are also joined by quarterly results from a number of more consumer-facing companies. There are also comments from a plethora of central bank speakers to digest.

1. Earnings season starts in earnest

First-quarter earnings season hits full stride this week, after a number of major Wall Street banks reported better-than-expected results on Friday.

Several more big banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Bank of America (NYSE: ), are due in the next few days, but the focus may now turn to how more consumer discretionary companies are faring given persistently high inflation and the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle.

Results from the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) and AutoNation (NYSE: ) are due this week, and could easily disrupt the optimism generated by Friday’s strong bank numbers.

Analysts expect earnings to have declined 4.8% in the first quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data Friday.

2. Central bankers speak

The major Western central banks–the , and –all have major policy decisions to make early next month, placing the focus firmly on comments from these policymakers before they enter their traditional blackout periods.

ECB President speaks in New York later Monday. Investors will be looking to see if she expands on Friday’s comment that “underlying inflationary pressures remain strong”, as opinions are divided on whether the Eurozone’s central bank will hike by 25 or 50 basis points in May.

, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England for Financial Stability, is scheduled to speak Monday, just a couple of days before the release of the U.K.’s for March.

Inflation unexpectedly rose to 10.4% in February, largely cementing another rate increase next month, which would be the BoE’s twelfth consecutive rate increase since December 2021.

A number of Fed officials are also due to speak in the next few days, including New York Fed President , Governor , Governor and Governor .

3. Futures edge higher; stocks remain resilient

U.S. futures traded marginally higher Monday, with investors awaiting the release of more quarterly earnings which should provide strong clues about the health of corporate America.

At 05:00 ET (09:00 GMT), the contract had gained 20 points or 0.1%, inched up 6 points or 0.1%, and added 10 points or 0.1%.

This is an important week for earnings [see above] with growth expectations pretty low following the Federal Reserve’s series of aggressive rate hikes in order to combat soaring inflation.

That said, stocks have remained resilient, with the positive overall last week for the fourth straight time, while the and both had their fourth up week in five.

4. SpaceX aims for the moon

Elon Musk's SpaceX is set to launch later Monday its new ultra-powerful Starship rocket system to space for the first time, in potentially another step forward in the company’s ambition of sending humans back to the moon and ultimately to Mars.

The aim of the launch, if conditions are right, is to provide crucial data about how the vehicle ascends to space and how it will fly back to Earth, with both the lower-stage Super Heavy booster rocket and the upper-stage Starship cruise vessel designed as reusable components, reducing the cost of future launches.

The optimism surrounding the SpaceX project contrasts vividly with the decision of Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit (OTC: ) to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month after the satellite launching business struggled to secure long-term funding following a failed launch in January.

The filing comes less than two years after Virgin Orbit went public at a valuation of roughly $3 billion.

5. Oil prices subdued ahead of Chinese growth data

Crude prices traded lower Monday, handing back some of the recent gains, as traders await the latest from China, the world’s largest crude importer.

By 05:00 ET, futures traded 0.4% lower to $82.09 a barrel, while the contract edged lower by 0.5% to $85.91 per barrel.

Both benchmarks recorded their fourth weekly gains last week, the longest such streak since mid-2022, continuing to be boosted by the output cuts announced by OPEC+ producers earlier this month.

The also helped sentiment last week by forecasting record demand in 2022, largely predicated on the recovery of the Chinese economy after the lifting of its zero-COVID policy.

With this in mind, the release of China’s first-quarter GDP early Tuesday is seen as key this week, as traders look for signs of demand recovery in the world's second-largest oil consumer."

Investing.com -- Earnings season gets underway in earnest while Federal Reserve policymakers will have a last chance to air their views ahead of next month's policy meeting. PMI data could point to the impact of the recent turmoil in the financial sector. Meanwhile, the U.K. and China are to release key economic data.

Earnings season

Banking heavyweights kicked off earnings season on Friday, with JPMorgan (NYSE: ), Citigroup (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) all beating expectations, benefiting from rising interest rates and easing fears of stress in the banking system.

First-quarter earnings season hits full stride in the coming week, with results expected from several more big banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: ) and Bank of America (NYSE: ) plus a long list of companies including Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), IBM (NYSE: ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ).

Analysts now expect earnings to have declined 4.8% in the first quarter from the year-ago period, according to Refinitiv data Friday. That compares with their week-ago forecast for a 5.2% year-over-year decline in the quarter.

""While we don't think earnings season will bring much in the way of good news, expectations are low enough that we may see stocks hold up again after results,"" Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group in Boston, wrote in a note Friday.

Fed watch

Most investors are betting that the Fed will still hike rates another 25 basis points at its next policy meeting on May 3, despite the minutes of the central bank's March meeting acknowledging the increased risk of a recession later this year after recent turmoil in the financial sector.

In the next few days, investors will have a final chance to hear from Fed officials before they enter their traditional blackout period ahead of the meeting, including New York Fed President John , Governor Michelle , Governor Christopher and Governor Lisa .

The U.S. is also to release data on , a pair of regional manufacturing surveys, and the weekly report on , which economists expect to show another increase amid a rise in layoffs since the beginning of the year.

PMI data

The Eurozone, the U.S. and the U.K. are to release PMI (purchasing managers index) data on Friday and market watchers will be on the lookout for signs of whether the recent turmoil in the banking sector is already affecting economic growth.

Last week the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecast and warned that problems in the financial sector meant the global economy was more likely to underperform rather than outstrip estimates.

The PMI data should show whether growth is slowing, and, if so, how quickly. This question is quickly becoming a major driver for markets as central banks approach the end of their tightening cycles.

Markets are betting on the Fed cutting rates by year-end, an expectation predicated on a major U.S. slowdown in the second half.

U.K. data

The U.K. is to release February data on Tuesday, followed by March data a day later, which could determine whether Bank of England officials decide to hike interest rates by another 25 basis points at their meeting next month.

Inflation unexpectedly rose to 10.4% in February, pushed up by higher prices for food, data that likely cemented the case for March's rate hike. Economists expect inflation to return to single digits in March, but this would still be well above the rate of inflation seen in the rest of Europe and the U.S.

While Britain’s economy has managed to avoid a recession, growth has stagnated over the past year.

Markets anticipate the BoE will hike interest rates next month to 4.5% from 4.25%, which would be its twelfth consecutive rate increase since December 2021.

China data

China is to release a flurry of economic data on Tuesday, including reports on first quarter , March and , with market participants hoping for more clarity on the uneven recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

While Chinese exports are increasing and credit growth is solid, inflation remains subdued as the consumer and industrial sectors struggle to recover in the wake of the hit from harsh pandemic-era restrictions.

Policymakers have pledged to step up support for the economy, which recorded one of its worst performances in nearly half a century last year due to the strict COVID-19 curbs.

UBS expects Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) first quarter to show continued progress toward re-accelerating growth, analysts told investors in a note Friday.

""We believe subs will come in ahead of mgmt's outlook for ""modest"" adds, helped by a slower ramp for paid sharing (shifting potential churn into 2Q),"" the analysts wrote.

UBS, which has a Neutral rating and $350 price target on the stock, now looks for 2.1 million adds in the first quarter and 2.5M in the second quarter (1.5M/2.8M prior), while its full-year estimate remains at 13M vs. 9M in 2022.

However, they expect the key debate into the print to be the impact of paid sharing on near-term growth.

""Netflix introduced paid sharing in CA, NZ, PT & ES in early Feb but no new mkts since (prior commentary suggested a broader roll-out for late 1Q). We continue to believe password sharing restrictions could provide a MSD % uplift to rev (ex churn) & quickly turn accretive,"" they added.

""We also see the roll-out as key to driving scale in ad, which could benefit from sharers migrating to the lower price ad product as well as better targeting as ad buyers will know the exact HH being reached. We estimate ad tiers could drive a ~10% tailwind to rev, but this uplift will be seen over multiple yrs."""

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is due to report Q1 results next week and several analysts are out with their previews.

JPMorgan analysts are generally positive on Netflix shares, although they warn “there is a near-term risk to 2Q numbers as paid sharing likely rolls out more broadly during the quarter.”

“Just as there was initial subscriber pushback and bumpiness in recently launched markets such as Canada, we would expect similar friction across a larger set of markets, likely to include the U.S., Brazil, those in Western Europe, and many others,” they said in a client note.

They also argue that Netflix will “walk back its expectation for greater paid net adds in 2Q than 1Q as the bulk of the paid sharing rollout will likely now come in 2Q, a seasonally weak quarter w/fewer gross additions at the top of the funnel.”

As a result, JPMorgan analysts increased their Q1 net adds estimates to 3.25 million while Q2 net adds are lowered to 1M. Overall, the H1 net adds estimates are down to 4.25M from the prior 4.75M. For Q3, JPM sees 500,000 net adds while the FY23 forecast of 16M is unchanged.

According to the analysts, surveyed investors are expecting 4-5M net adds in the first half of the year.

“Our overall numbers for 2022 are largely unchanged and we continue to view the paid sharing rollout--in conjunction with advertising--as a major part of the near-term bull thesis to expand NFLX’s SAM,” the analysts concluded.

Markets anticipate the BoE will hike interest rates next month to 4.5% from 4.25%, which would be its twelfth consecutive rate increase since December 2021.

China data

China is to release a flurry of economic data on Tuesday, including reports on first quarter , March and , with market participants hoping for more clarity on the uneven recovery in the world’s second largest economy.

While Chinese exports are increasing and credit growth is solid, inflation remains subdued as the consumer and industrial sectors struggle to recover in the wake of the hit from harsh pandemic-era restrictions.

Policymakers have pledged to step up support for the economy, which recorded one of its worst performances in nearly half a century last year due to the strict COVID-19 curbs.

2022-04-14, Investing.com,Netflix's Q1 to show progress toward re-accelerating growth - UBS,https://in.investing.com/news/netflixs-q1-to-show-progress-toward-reaccelerating-growth--ubs-432SI-3599754,"By Sam Boughedda

UBS expects Netflix's (NASDAQ: ) first quarter to show continued progress toward re-accelerating growth, analysts told investors in a note Friday.

""We believe subs will come in ahead of mgmt's outlook for ""modest"" adds, helped by a slower ramp for paid sharing (shifting potential churn into 2Q),"" the analysts wrote.

UBS, which has a Neutral rating and $350 price target on the stock, now looks for 2.1 million adds in the first quarter and 2.5M in the second quarter (1.5M/2.8M prior), while its full-year estimate remains at 13M vs. 9M in 2022.

However, they expect the key debate into the print to be the impact of paid sharing on near-term growth.

""Netflix introduced paid sharing in CA, NZ, PT & ES in early Feb but no new mkts since (prior commentary suggested a broader roll-out for late 1Q). We continue to believe password sharing restrictions could provide a MSD % uplift to rev (ex churn) & quickly turn accretive,"" they added.

""We also see the roll-out as key to driving scale in ad, which could benefit from sharers migrating to the lower price ad product as well as better targeting as ad buyers will know the exact HH being reached. We estimate ad tiers could drive a ~10% tailwind to rev, but this uplift will be seen over multiple yrs."""

Investing.com -- Warner Bros. Discovery said Wednesday it is combining HBO Max and Discovery+ content to roll out a new streaming service called “Max” in May, as the company seeks to take the fight to streaming leaders Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and Disney (NYSE: ).

Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ: ) fell 2.8% in recent trade.

Max, which is expected to debut May 23, ""offers consumers something truly distinct and appealing,"" WBD CEO David Zaslav said at an event in Burbank, California. “It gives us a huge opportunity as a company,” he added

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) is due to report Q1 results next week and several analysts are out with their previews.

JPMorgan analysts are generally positive on Netflix shares, although they warn “there is a near-term risk to 2Q numbers as paid sharing likely rolls out more broadly during the quarter.”

“Just as there was initial subscriber pushback and bumpiness in recently launched markets such as Canada, we would expect similar friction across a larger set of markets, likely to include the U.S., Brazil, those in Western Europe, and many others,” they said in a client note.

They also argue that Netflix will “walk back its expectation for greater paid net adds in 2Q than 1Q as the bulk of the paid sharing rollout will likely now come in 2Q, a seasonally weak quarter w/fewer gross additions at the top of the funnel.”

As a result, JPMorgan analysts increased their Q1 net adds estimates to 3.25 million while Q2 net adds are lowered to 1M. Overall, the H1 net adds estimates are down to 4.25M from the prior 4.75M. For Q3, JPM sees 500,000 net adds while the FY23 forecast of 16M is unchanged.

According to the analysts, surveyed investors are expecting 4-5M net adds in the first half of the year.

“Our overall numbers for 2022 are largely unchanged and we continue to view the paid sharing rollout--in conjunction with advertising--as a major part of the near-term bull thesis to expand NFLX’s SAM,” the analysts concluded.

Netflix is set to post its first-quarter results on April 18. Morgan Stanley ""remains below consensus for 2Q23 net additions (MSe at +1.55mm vs. consensus of +3.8mm), given typical seasonality headwinds.""

2022-04-06, Bloomberg,Apple’s $165 Billion Cash Hoard Creates M&A Mirages,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-165-billion-cash-hoard-creates-ma-mirages-3589552,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s slowing growth and cash-rich balance sheet are again fueling speculation that the world’s most valuable company should make a big acquisition.

Entertainment giant Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co. recently joined a long list of potential acquisition targets that over the years has grown to include Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: ) Inc. and Sonos (NASDAQ: ) Inc. They all have one thing in common: Anyone betting that Apple would buy them has so far been sorely disappointed.

“You’re probably missing the value of the business if you think the key catalyst for investment is a major acquisition,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. “It’s a low-probability bet.”

Apple is famous for eschewing splashy acquisitions in contrast with peers like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., which have continued to make deals despite increasing scrutiny by regulators. Instead, Apple favors buying small startups to augment its home-grown pushes into new markets even if those efforts take many years to bear fruit.

With Apple’s shares outperforming again in 2022, it’s unlikely the iPhone maker is shifting strategies. The stock is up 25% in 2022, outperforming its megacap peers for the second-consecutive year. Over the past two decades, Apple has averaged an annual return of 39%, including dividends. The , by comparison, sits at 10%.

The stock fell 0.8% on Thursday.

“Not doing a big deal hasn’t impacted them and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” said Gregg Abella, chief executive officer of Investment Partners Asset Management, which holds the stock. “I’m pleased that Apple has a lot of discipline in this regard.”

Apple’s biggest purchase in its history was the $3 billion takeover of Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014. Microsoft’s pending acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) is valued at $69 billion.

Even with Apple’s revenue growth projected to shrink 2% in fiscal 2022, the company appears to be doing even less on the acquisition front. It spent $306 million on business acquisitions in fiscal 2022, down from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020. In the most recently reported quarter, Apple removed the line item in its financials that accounted for such activity.

Instead of splurging on deals, Apple returns much of its excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Those expenditures totaled more than $100 billion in fiscal 2022 and it still had $165 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of Dec. 31.

For Logan Purk, an Edward Jones analyst, Apple has been so successful by making smaller, incremental acquisitions that a bigger deal would raise a lot of concerns.

“If Apple tried to do some massive deal that was outside of its wheelhouse — not complementary, really changing its story — that would make me worried,” Purk said in an interview. “It would be so outside its normal course of action that you would have to ask why.”

Tech Chart of the Day

More than two dozen analysts have raised their 12-month price targets following Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s second round of layoffs in mid-March. However, the analysts’ return potential for the stock sits at 9.7%, comfortably below its 5-year average of about 24%. The stock has surged almost 140% from a seven-year low in November as Meta started cutting thousands of jobs in light of falling sales.

ByteDance’s TikTok remains the favorite social platform for Gen Z, according to Piper Sandler’s latest survey.

The Chinese social media giant topped the list with a 37% share, down by 1% compared to the Fall of 2022. Snap (NYSE: ) is second on the list with a 27% share (down from 30%) while Instagram is the third most popular app with a share of 23% (up from the prior 20%).

“We find TikTok’s decline in leadership as encouraging and a testament to product improvements at META. We view a combination of (1) improving CPMs, (2) share gain versus TikTok, and (3) focus on cost efficiency as positive drivers for the stock,” the analysts wrote in a note.

Elsewhere, 68% of teens said they are using Spotify (NYSE: ) with 44% paying for the company’s services. 31% of survey respondents said they watch Netflix (NASDAQ: ) on a daily basis, down 1% from the last survey. Similarly, YouTube’s share fell by 100 basis points to 28%.

As much as 87% of teens own an iPhone with 88% expecting an iPhone to be their next phone. Every third teen said they own an Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch.

Both metrics “are near record highs for our survey,” the analysts added.

“We believe the elevated penetration and intention are important given the mature premium smartphone market. Additionally, these trends are encouraging as the company continues to introduce new iPhones, proves the overall stickiness of the product portfolio. We think these positive trends can also be a catalyst for further services growth as well, as the install base for Apple hardware continues to grow.”"

BofA and Wells Fargo released notes outlining their top 10 ideas for the second quarter on Monday, with analysts on both sides picking out Lowe's Companies (NYSE: ) as one to watch for potential upside.

Analysts at Wells Fargo said the picks represent seven sectors where they see significant second quarter catalysts that could drive meaningful upside or downside.

Intuit (NASDAQ: ), Spotify (NYSE: ), Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: ), SLB (NYSE: ), Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: ), Lowe's Cos., Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE: ), and Academy Sports and Outdoor (NASDAQ: ) made it onto the list for Overweight tactical ideas at Wells Fargo. Underweight ideas are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ: ).

The firm said Intuit is well-positioned, Spotify has a strong long-term financial outlook, and Eli Lilly's Donanemab has an attractive risk/reward. For LMT, Wells Fargo analysts state that the stock trades at a premium, while they believe Paramount ""is in the cross-hairs of Media sector challenges.""

In addition, Wells Fargo also believes Lowe's shares are too cheap. ""We see easing multi-year compares, leverage to warmer weather in April/May & narrowing comp/margin gap vs. HD. Falling rates are a plus,"" the firm said.

Meanwhile, BofA analysts picked out CubeSmart (NYSE: ), FedEx (NYSE: ), Flowserve (NYSE: ), Lamb Weston (NYSE: ), Lowe's, Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Progressive Corp. (NYSE: ), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: ) as their Buy ideas for the quarter, with CarMax (NYSE: ) and United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) their Underperform ideas.

BofA said CubeSmart has a high-quality self-storage portfolio, they expect accelerating cost-cutting efforts at FedEx, and that demand will remain solid for Flowserve.

On Netflix, BofA believes it will outperform based on ""four main drivers: (1) a crackdown on password sharing, (2) the introduction of a value-oriented, ad-supported tier which expands TAM and monetization, (3) an inflection point in free cash flow, and (4) a significant subscriber runway accelerating by the shift from linear to streaming.""

On Lowe's, the firms wrote that while recent spending trends across consumer categories have declined on a YoY basis through March, they expect them to come out of the trough from April through June and beyond.

""Meanwhile, Lowe's will continue to execute on its long-term margin improvement strategy, likely further narrowing the margin gap with rival Home Depot, which is in the midst of a heavy investment cycle,"" BofA analysts believe."

Investing.com -- Shares in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) inched higher in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that the streaming giant is overhauling its film division.

Movie unit head Scott Stuber is aiming to rein in the number of titles the company produces to ensure that the films are of higher quality, according to Bloomberg. Netflix has typically far outpaced its peers in Hollywood in terms of annual movie output, churning out around 50 pictures per year.

As part of the restructuring, the group will bring together its divisions that make small and medium-sized feature-length projects, Bloomberg reported. The move will result in some layoffs, as well as the departure of long-time executives.

Decision-making inside the company will now be more centralized, Bloomberg said, as Stuber looks to encourage more top-level collaboration. Previously, Netflix went on a hiring spree to staff several relatively-autonomous segments that were tasked with producing movies with small-, medium- and large-range budgets.

The changes come after Netflix axed hundreds of jobs last year in an effort to offset slowing subscriber growth through cost cuts. It has also offered customers a cheaper streaming plan with advertising and cracked down on account sharing between users, all in a bid to boost revenues."

The service was announced in October of last year, but there were some devices that were not supported, including the Apple TV. The cheaper tier is now available in the Netflix tvOS app starting this week, reports TechCrunch.

Prior to this update, Apple TV users were not able to access Netflix's ads tier and were offered either a more expensive plan or an alternative device to try.

Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra, PlayStation 3 and Netflix app for Windows are yet to receive the tier, the report mentioned.

Netflix rolled out the ""Basic With Ads"" steaming plan on November 3 last year to subscribers in the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Canada and Mexico for $6.99.

Ads are 15 or 30 seconds in length and play before and during shows and films.

Meanwhile, Netflix has announced that it will bring 40 more games later this year, and also 70 titles are in development with its partners.

""That's in addition to the 16 games currently being developed by our in-house game studios,"" the company said in a statement.

2022-04-06, Bloomberg,Apple’s $165 Billion Cash Hoard Creates M&A Mirages,https://in.investing.com/news/apples-165-billion-cash-hoard-creates-ma-mirages-3589552,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s slowing growth and cash-rich balance sheet are again fueling speculation that the world’s most valuable company should make a big acquisition.

Entertainment giant Walt Disney (NYSE: ) Co. recently joined a long list of potential acquisition targets that over the years has grown to include Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: )., Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: ) Inc. and Sonos (NASDAQ: ) Inc. They all have one thing in common: Anyone betting that Apple would buy them has so far been sorely disappointed.

“You’re probably missing the value of the business if you think the key catalyst for investment is a major acquisition,” said Kevin Walkush, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management. “It’s a low-probability bet.”

Apple is famous for eschewing splashy acquisitions in contrast with peers like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: ). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: )., which have continued to make deals despite increasing scrutiny by regulators. Instead, Apple favors buying small startups to augment its home-grown pushes into new markets even if those efforts take many years to bear fruit.

With Apple’s shares outperforming again in 2022, it’s unlikely the iPhone maker is shifting strategies. The stock is up 25% in 2022, outperforming its megacap peers for the second-consecutive year. Over the past two decades, Apple has averaged an annual return of 39%, including dividends. The , by comparison, sits at 10%.

The stock fell 0.8% on Thursday.

“Not doing a big deal hasn’t impacted them and if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” said Gregg Abella, chief executive officer of Investment Partners Asset Management, which holds the stock. “I’m pleased that Apple has a lot of discipline in this regard.”

Apple’s biggest purchase in its history was the $3 billion takeover of Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014. Microsoft’s pending acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ) is valued at $69 billion.

Even with Apple’s revenue growth projected to shrink 2% in fiscal 2022, the company appears to be doing even less on the acquisition front. It spent $306 million on business acquisitions in fiscal 2022, down from $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020. In the most recently reported quarter, Apple removed the line item in its financials that accounted for such activity.

Instead of splurging on deals, Apple returns much of its excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Those expenditures totaled more than $100 billion in fiscal 2022 and it still had $165 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as of Dec. 31.

For Logan Purk, an Edward Jones analyst, Apple has been so successful by making smaller, incremental acquisitions that a bigger deal would raise a lot of concerns.

“If Apple tried to do some massive deal that was outside of its wheelhouse — not complementary, really changing its story — that would make me worried,” Purk said in an interview. “It would be so outside its normal course of action that you would have to ask why.”

Tech Chart of the Day

More than two dozen analysts have raised their 12-month price targets following Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ).’s second round of layoffs in mid-March. However, the analysts’ return potential for the stock sits at 9.7%, comfortably below its 5-year average of about 24%. The stock has surged almost 140% from a seven-year low in November as Meta started cutting thousands of jobs in light of falling sales.

ByteDance’s TikTok remains the favorite social platform for Gen Z, according to Piper Sandler’s latest survey.

The Chinese social media giant topped the list with a 37% share, down by 1% compared to the Fall of 2022. Snap (NYSE: ) is second on the list with a 27% share (down from 30%) while Instagram is the third most popular app with a share of 23% (up from the prior 20%).

“We find TikTok’s decline in leadership as encouraging and a testament to product improvements at META. We view a combination of (1) improving CPMs, (2) share gain versus TikTok, and (3) focus on cost efficiency as positive drivers for the stock,” the analysts wrote in a note.

Elsewhere, 68% of teens said they are using Spotify (NYSE: ) with 44% paying for the company’s services. 31% of survey respondents said they watch Netflix (NASDAQ: ) on a daily basis, down 1% from the last survey. Similarly, YouTube’s share fell by 100 basis points to 28%.

As much as 87% of teens own an iPhone with 88% expecting an iPhone to be their next phone. Every third teen said they own an Apple (NASDAQ: ) Watch.

Both metrics “are near record highs for our survey,” the analysts added.

“We believe the elevated penetration and intention are important given the mature premium smartphone market. Additionally, these trends are encouraging as the company continues to introduce new iPhones, proves the overall stickiness of the product portfolio. We think these positive trends can also be a catalyst for further services growth as well, as the install base for Apple hardware continues to grow.”"
2022-04-03, Investing.com,BofA and Wells Fargo pick Lowe's as a top idea for Q2,https://in.investing.com/news/bofa-and-wells-fargo-pick-lowes-as-a-top-idea-for-q2-432SI-3584842,"By Sam Boughedda

BofA and Wells Fargo released notes outlining their top 10 ideas for the second quarter on Monday, with analysts on both sides picking out Lowe's Companies (NYSE: ) as one to watch for potential upside.

Analysts at Wells Fargo said the picks represent seven sectors where they see significant second quarter catalysts that could drive meaningful upside or downside.

Intuit (NASDAQ: ), Spotify (NYSE: ), Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: ), SLB (NYSE: ), Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE: ), Lowe's Cos., Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE: ), and Academy Sports and Outdoor (NASDAQ: ) made it onto the list for Overweight tactical ideas at Wells Fargo. Underweight ideas are Lockheed Martin (NYSE: ) and Paramount Global (NASDAQ: ).

The firm said Intuit is well-positioned, Spotify has a strong long-term financial outlook, and Eli Lilly's Donanemab has an attractive risk/reward. For LMT, Wells Fargo analysts state that the stock trades at a premium, while they believe Paramount ""is in the cross-hairs of Media sector challenges.""

In addition, Wells Fargo also believes Lowe's shares are too cheap. ""We see easing multi-year compares, leverage to warmer weather in April/May & narrowing comp/margin gap vs. HD. Falling rates are a plus,"" the firm said.

Meanwhile, BofA analysts picked out CubeSmart (NYSE: ), FedEx (NYSE: ), Flowserve (NYSE: ), Lamb Weston (NYSE: ), Lowe's, Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Progressive Corp. (NYSE: ), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: ) as their Buy ideas for the quarter, with CarMax (NYSE: ) and United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) their Underperform ideas.

BofA said CubeSmart has a high-quality self-storage portfolio, they expect accelerating cost-cutting efforts at FedEx, and that demand will remain solid for Flowserve.

On Netflix, BofA believes it will outperform based on ""four main drivers: (1) a crackdown on password sharing, (2) the introduction of a value-oriented, ad-supported tier which expands TAM and monetization, (3) an inflection point in free cash flow, and (4) a significant subscriber runway accelerating by the shift from linear to streaming.""

On Lowe's, the firms wrote that while recent spending trends across consumer categories have declined on a YoY basis through March, they expect them to come out of the trough from April through June and beyond.

""Meanwhile, Lowe's will continue to execute on its long-term margin improvement strategy, likely further narrowing the margin gap with rival Home Depot, which is in the midst of a heavy investment cycle,"" BofA analysts believe."

Investing.com -- Shares in Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: ) inched higher in premarket U.S. trading on Friday after Bloomberg News reported that the streaming giant is overhauling its film division.

Movie unit head Scott Stuber is aiming to rein in the number of titles the company produces to ensure that the films are of higher quality, according to Bloomberg. Netflix has typically far outpaced its peers in Hollywood in terms of annual movie output, churning out around 50 pictures per year.

As part of the restructuring, the group will bring together its divisions that make small and medium-sized feature-length projects, Bloomberg reported. The move will result in some layoffs, as well as the departure of long-time executives.

Decision-making inside the company will now be more centralized, Bloomberg said, as Stuber looks to encourage more top-level collaboration. Previously, Netflix went on a hiring spree to staff several relatively-autonomous segments that were tasked with producing movies with small-, medium- and large-range budgets.

The changes come after Netflix axed hundreds of jobs last year in an effort to offset slowing subscriber growth through cost cuts. It has also offered customers a cheaper streaming plan with advertising and cracked down on account sharing between users, all in a bid to boost revenues."
2022-03-31, IANS,Netflix rolls out ad-supported plan for Apple TV users,https://in.investing.com/news/netflix-rolls-out-adsupported-plan-for-apple-tv-users-3581081,"San Francisco, March 31 (IANS) Streaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ: ) has rolled out its ad-supported plan -- ""Basic with Ads"" for Apple (NASDAQ: ) TV users after a delay of months.

The service was announced in October of last year, but there were some devices that were not supported, including the Apple TV. The cheaper tier is now available in the Netflix tvOS app starting this week, reports TechCrunch.

Prior to this update, Apple TV users were not able to access Netflix's ads tier and were offered either a more expensive plan or an alternative device to try.

Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra, PlayStation 3 and Netflix app for Windows are yet to receive the tier, the report mentioned.

Netflix rolled out the ""Basic With Ads"" steaming plan on November 3 last year to subscribers in the US, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Canada and Mexico for $6.99.

Ads are 15 or 30 seconds in length and play before and during shows and films.

Meanwhile, Netflix has announced that it will bring 40 more games later this year, and also 70 titles are in development with its partners.

""That's in addition to the 16 games currently being developed by our in-house game studios,"" the company said in a statement.

Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients on Thursday that hedge funds leaned more towards secular growth in January.

""They increased weight to nearly 65% of portfolio, an OW of 21.8%, up from 17.1% last month,"" the analysts wrote, with the firm having assessed MSCI Hedge Fund data.

""Much of the increase in OW occurred in Tech, as it stood at 10% vs. 4.7% the previous month,"" they added. ""Hedge Funds also bumped up their OW to Comm Services to 14% vs. 10.1% one month ago. As for Health Care, it moved from UW to OW, at 1.8%.""

However, they revealed that the investors are slightly underweight towards the firm's Sweet 16, Jefferies' version of FAANG+, which includes names such as Apple (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Tesla (NASDAQ: ), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ).

""We found that Hedge Funds were marginally UW this group, by just 1.2%. However, all of this is due to the net short position in AAPL. Over the last three months, these stocks have been slightly OW/UW by this investor base,"" they explained.

The analysts concluded: ""As we moved through January, we found that Hedge Funds increased their Net Long position to 265%, which is above its long-term average. With this increase, we saw the Net Short position rise to -165%, hence the ratio stood at 1.6x."""
2022-03-30, Bloomberg,Alphabet Is Standing Out as a Rare Megacap Bargain,https://in.investing.com/news/alphabet-is-standing-out-as-a-rare-megacap-bargain-3580014,"(Bloomberg) -- Major technology and internet stocks have regained investor favor this year, and no company is ticking more boxes for bulls than Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) Inc.

Not only does the Google owner offer the strong cash flow and growth characteristics sought by investors amid rising economic uncertainty, it’s the only one of the five biggest technology firms by market value priced at a discount to the .

Despite losing ground this week as easing fears about the banking system cooled high demand for megacaps, Alphabet’s shares are up 13% in March, nearly twice the gain for the tech-heavy benchmark. The rally has added more than $140 billion to Alphabet’s market value and put the stock on track for its biggest monthly gain in almost two years.

“Of the megacaps, Alphabet is the only one that has growth above 10%, that has a valuation that’s palpable, and which has the opportunity for multiple expansion,” said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, who has been reducing his exposure to big tech but remains bullish on Alphabet.

The stock trades at about 17 times expected profits over the next 12 months, compared with 24 times for the Nasdaq 100 and Alphabet’s average over the past decade of 20. The valuation makes it a relative bargain among tech heavyweights. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: )., Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: )., and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) Corp. all trade at premiums to historical averages and the Nasdaq 100. While Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: ). is cheap relative to its long-term average, its multiple of about 35 dwarfs that of the benchmark.

Alphabet shares tumbled 39% last year amid a pullback in spending on digital advertising and a broad selloff in tech stocks as the Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. However, in recent months analysts have been raising revenue estimates for 2022 and growth is now expected to rebound to 18% from 10% in 2022.

Artificial Intelligence

“With Alphabet, you not only get the growth in the business, but have potential for some valuation expansion as more clarity is reached on long-term questions, like antitrust actions,” said Patrick Burton, a portfolio manager at Winslow Capital Management.

One issue that’s dogged Alphabet this year is its standing in the race to employ artificial intelligence, which has driven a frenzy of investor interest. Concerns about the competency of Bard, Alphabet’s ChatGPT rival, caused the stock to tumble in February amid fears its market share in the lucrative search advertising business was at risk.

Google recently granted access to Bard and both Bloomberg Intelligence and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). analysts wrote that the launch can help ease concerns about the perceived lead of Microsoft, which uses ChatGPT technology.

“The AI story has only just started, and since Alphabet trades at a discount, it is harder to say that Microsoft or Apple have the same potential for upside,” said Winslow Capital’s Burton.

Tech Chart of the Day

The Nasdaq 100 Index entered a bull market on Wednesday with a 1.9% advance that has the tech-heavy gauge up just over 20% from a December closing low. Big Tech has been a large contributor to the index’s advance, with major components Nvidia, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: ). and Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc. the biggest percentage gainers of 2022. In a measure of how top-heavy the rally has been, an equal-weighted version of the index is up only 13% over the same period.

After conducting a deep-dive analysis into the company's paid sharing efforts, Wells Fargo analysts reiterated an Overweight rating and a $400 per share price target on Netflix (NASDAQ: ).

The analysts believe the recent ~10% rally in Netflix shares “reflects early bullishness around the paid sharing opportunity.”

“While much has been written on AVOD, paid sharing is arguably the bigger near-term earnings opportunity given some 100mm global paid sharers incl. 30mm domestically… Significant upward revisions look likely,” they said in a note sent to clients.

The analysts highlight the Street’s consensus for Netflix to add 15 million subscribers this year. They are more bullish and believe that Netflix could add more than 20 million paid sharing subscribers alone.

“Our base case is paid sharing will deliver incremental revenue of nearly $3bn, so if we're in the ballpark, it implies '24E Street revenue is far too low since AVOD and base subscription revenue is also growing,” they added.

The analysts still see an attractive entry in Netflix shares despite a 12% rally in shares year-to-date. Their price target of $400 per share implies a ~20% upside potential.

However, they also see a realistic case for Netflix shares to trade at $430 apiece “and potentially as high as $560/sh using our bull case EPS.” The latter implies a near 70% rally from current levels.

“We continue to like the stock here and view the entry point as attractive despite the recent run. Q1 comments on paid sharing should be a catalyst,” the analysts concluded."

Netflix (NASDAQ: ) subscriber results for the US and Canada will be ""significantly stronger than current consensus,"" according to BofA analysts citing third-party data.

The current consensus is for +100K adds, according to the analysts, while BofA's estimate is for a loss of 350K. The analysts maintained a Buy rating and $410 price target on the stock in their research note.

""Specifically, the data source has indicated that net adds will be greater than +500k for UCAN as gross adds in Canada have accelerated materially,"" they wrote. ""In addition to the data indicating net adds will be much better than current estimates, the new data also counters previous third-party data that UCAN sub results were trailing expectations.""

The analysts added that it aligns with management commentary that churn initially will increase and then quickly reverse, while they believe the password sharing crackdown will ""result in a greater number of subs and revenue as primary account holders either pay an additional fee for members who have moved out of the household or those sharing accounts become full subscribers.""

The analysts expect the higher subscriber count will have a minimal impact on first-quarter revenue but alleviate concerns that Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown was having a detrimental effect on subscriber results.

""NFLX estimates 100mn potential subs, including 30mn in UCAN, are lost because of password sharing. We view this headwind as an enormous long-term opportunity, with sizable upside realized in 2022/2024,"" they added. ""Given the strong level of engagement on NFLX’s service, we believe they are particularly well-positioned to convert a significant percentage of these lost subs."""
